While eSPA ensembles yield state-of-the-art forecast skill, they are harder to interpret than individual eSPA models. We show how to compress the ensemble into a compact set of \"distilled\" models by aggregating the structure of only those ensemble members that make correct predictions. This process yields a single, diagnostically tractable model for each forecast lead time that preserves forecast performance while also enabling diagnostics that are impractical to implement on the full ensemble.\n  An analysis of the regime persistence of the distilled model \"superclusters\", as well as cross-lead clustering consistency, shows that the discretised system accurately captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of ENSO. By considering the effective dimension of the feature importance vectors, the complexity of the input space required for correct ENSO phase prediction is shown to peak when forecasts must cross the boreal spring predictability barrier. Spatial importance maps derived from the feature importance vectors are introduced to identify where predictive information resides in each field and are shown to include known physical precursors at certain lead times. Case studies of key events are also presented, showing how fields reconstructed from distilled model centroids trace the evolution from extratropical and inter-basin precursors to the mature ENSO state. Overall, the distillation framework enables a rigorous investigation of long-range ENSO predictability that complements real-time data-driven operational forecasts.", "AI": {"tldr": "A distillation framework compresses high-performing but complex eSPA ensemble models for 24-month ENSO prediction into interpretable single models by aggregating only correct-predicting members, preserving skill while enabling new diagnostics of ENSO dynamics and precursors.", "motivation": "While eSPA ensembles achieve state-of-the-art ENSO forecast skill up to 24 months ahead using satellite data, they are difficult to interpret and diagnose; there is a need for compact, diagnostically tractable models that preserve ensemble performance while revealing predictive mechanisms.", "method": "Train an ensemble of entropy-optimal Sparse Probabilistic Approximation (eSPA) models on satellite-era observational/reanalysis data for ENSO phase prediction, then distill by aggregating the structure of ensemble members that make correct predictions into a single compact model for each forecast lead time.", "result": "The distilled models preserve ensemble forecast performance while becoming diagnostically interpretable; they capture ENSO spatiotemporal dynamics, show complexity peaking at the boreal spring predictability barrier, identify known physical precursors via spatial importance maps, and trace event evolution from precursors to mature states.", "conclusion": "This distillation framework enables rigorous investigation of long-range ENSO predictability by providing interpretable, high-performing models that complement operational forecasts and facilitate physical understanding of ENSO dynamics and precursors."}}

These observables might not be known a priori, but they may in principle be identified through analyzing the quantum state of the system. Experimentally, this can be particularly demanding as estimating quantum states and expectation values of quantum observables requires a large number of projective measurements. However, open quantum systems can be probed in situ by monitoring their output, e.g. via heterodyne-detection or photon-counting experiments, which provide space-time resolved information about their dynamics. Building on this, we present a machine-learning approach to detect nonequilibrium phase transitions from the measurement time-records of continuously-monitored quantum systems. We benchmark our method using the quantum contact process, a model featuring an absorbing-state phase transition, which constitutes a particularly challenging test case for the quantum simulation of nonequilibrium processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "A machine learning method detects nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions using only continuous measurement time-records, bypassing the need for prior knowledge of order parameters or full quantum state tomography.", "motivation": "Traditional characterization of quantum collective behavior requires known order parameters and extensive projective measurements for quantum state estimation, which is experimentally demanding.

However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems.

Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes.

They can also be used as transformations to construct dualities between such models, both invertible (including unitary) and non-invertible (including discrete gauging). We analyse how the local Yang--Baxter integrable structures are modified under such dualities. We see that the $\\check{R}$-matrix, that appears in the baxterization approach to integrability, transforms in a simple manner. We further show for a broad class of MPOs that the usual Yang--Baxter $R$-matrix satisfies a modified algebra, previously identified in the unitary case, that gives a local integrable structure underlying the commuting transfer matrices of the dual model. We illustrate these results with two case studies, analysing an invertible unitary MPO and a non-invertible MPO both applied to the canonical XXZ spin chain. The former is the cluster entangler, arising in the study of symmetry-protected topological phases, while the latter is the Kramers--Wannier duality.

Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability. These results establish dissipation as a powerful tool for engineering dynamical phases, restoring quantum coherence, and controlling the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u98a0\u8986\u4e86\u8017\u6563\u603b\u662f\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u53cc\u7ec4\u5206\u73bb\u8272-\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u68ee\u7ed3\u4e2d\uff0c\u8017\u6563\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u63a7\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u6b65\u632f\u8361\u3001\u77ed\u6682\u6df7\u6c8c\u4e0e\u7a33\u6001\u6df7\u6c8c\u7b49\u76f8\uff0c\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8017\u6563\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4f1a\u5f15\u8d77\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc1\u660e\u8017\u6563\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8d44\u6e90\u6765\u91cd\u5851\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u53cc\u7ec4\u5206\u73bb\u8272-\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u68ee\u7ed3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u52bf\u9631\u503e\u659c\uff09\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8017\u6563\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a1\uff09\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f53\u7cfb\u5448\u73b0\u8017\u6563\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u76f8\u4f4d\u9501\u5b9a\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8fb9\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u6676\u4f53\uff1b2\uff09\u8f83\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f15\u53d1\u8017\u6563\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u8fdb\u5165\u81ea\u56da\u7981\u6df7\u6c8c\u6001\uff0c\u8017\u6563\u80fd\u8c03\u8282\u6df7\u6c8c\u5bff\u547d\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5e72\u6062\u590d\uff1b3\uff09\u52a0\u5165\u53ef\u63a7\u503e\u659c\u52bf\u540e\uff0c\u77ed\u6682\u6df7\u6c8c\u53ef\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7a33\u6001\u6df7\u6c8c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u8c31\u8bca\u65ad\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u6df7\u6c8c\u6001\uff0c\u4ec5\u53cd\u6620\u77ed\u65f6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8017\u6563\u662f\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u8c03\u63a7\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u3001\u6062\u590d\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a7\u5236\u6df7\u6c8c\u884c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u7f6e\u4e71\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Lattice-dynamics analysis reveals that the crystal symmetry is lower than previously proposed and is consistent with a $P1$ space group at low temperature. Several infrared-active phonon modes exhibit pronounced anomalies at both the structural transition temperature $T_S \\approx 125$--$130$~K and the N\u00e9el temperature $T_N \\approx 95$~K. First-principles calculations show that the modes affected at $T_S$ predominantly involve displacements that modulate magnetic exchange pathways. Neutron scattering demonstrates that below $T_N$ the magnetic order is three-dimensional, long-ranged, and static. Between $T_N$ and $T_S$, the system displays three-dimensional short-range dynamic magnetic correlations, which disappear above $T_S$. The structural transition thus coincides with the onset of magnetic fluctuations rather than with static magnetic order. Our results indicate that short-range, dynamical magnetic correlations are sufficient to drive a static structural instability, providing a magnetically driven mechanism reminiscent of the iron-pnictide 122 family, yet realized here in a quasi-one-dimensional Mott system. These findings highlight the central role of magnetoelastic coupling in iron-based superconductors beyond the itinerant regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u51c6\u4e00\u7ef4\u68af\u5b50\u5316\u5408\u7269BaFe\u2082S\u2083\u4e2d\u77ed\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u78c1\u5173\u8054\u53ef\u9a71\u52a8\u9759\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u94c1\u57fa\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u975e\u5de1\u6e38\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u78c1\u5f39\u6027\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6676\u683c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3001\u58f0\u5b50\u4e0e\u78c1\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u53d8\u4e0e\u78c1\u6709\u5e8f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u94c1\u57fa\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u975e\u5de1\u6e38\u7535\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u78c1\u5f39\u6027\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6781\u5316\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u6742\u5316\u6cdb\u51fd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u975e\u5f39\u6027\u4e2d\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6676\u683c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u58f0\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u78c1\u6fc0\u53d1\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u6e29\u6676\u4f53\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e3aP1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7fa4\uff1b\u591a\u4e2a\u7ea2\u5916\u6d3b\u6027\u58f0\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\u6e29\u5ea6T_S\u2248125-130K\u548c\u5948\u5c14\u6e29\u5ea6T_N\u224895K\u5904\u51fa\u73b0\u5f02\u5e38\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660eT_S\u5904\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3b\u8981\u8c03\u5236\u78c1\u4ea4\u6362\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u4e2d\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u663e\u793aT_N\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u957f\u7a0b\u9759\u6001\u78c1\u6709\u5e8f\uff0cT_N\u4e0eT_S\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u77ed\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u78c1\u5173\u8054\uff0cT_S\u4ee5\u4e0a\u78c1\u5173\u8054\u6d88\u5931\uff1b\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e0e\u78c1\u6da8\u843d\u7684 onset \u76f8\u543b\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77ed\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u78c1\u5173\u8054\u8db3\u4ee5\u9a71\u52a8\u9759\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u78c1\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u867d\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u94c1\u78f7\u7cfb122\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u51c6\u4e00\u7ef4Mott\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u78c1\u5f39\u6027\u8026\u5408\u5728\u94c1\u57fa\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5de1\u6e38\u7535\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u8303\u7574\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches mainly rely on post-crash features (e.g., crash type and severity) that are rarely available in real time, limiting their practical applicability. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid secondary crash likelihood prediction framework that does not depend on post-crash features. A dynamic spatiotemporal window is designed to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and their upstream segments. The framework includes three models: a primary crash model to estimate the likelihood of secondary crash occurrence, and two secondary crash models to evaluate traffic conditions at crash and upstream segments under different comparative scenarios. An ensemble learning strategy integrating six machine learning algorithms is developed to enhance predictive performance, and a voting-based mechanism combines the outputs of the three models. Experiments on Florida freeways demonstrate that the proposed hybrid framework correctly identifies 91% of secondary crashes with a low false alarm rate of 0.20. The Area Under the ROC Curve improves from 0.654, 0.744, and 0.902 for the individual models to 0.952 for the hybrid model, outperforming previous studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e8b\u6545\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u540e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u4f5b\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u9ad8\u901f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe91%", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u4e8b\u6545\u7c7b\u578b/\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u7a97\u53e3\u63d0\u53d6\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4e3b\u4e8b\u6545\u6a21\u578b+\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e8b\u6545\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5408\u516d\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u7efc\u5408\u8f93\u51fa", "result": "\u5728\u4f5b\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u9ad8\u901f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b91%\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u73870.20\uff1bROC\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\u4ece\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u9ad80.902\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b0.952", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e8b\u6545\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848"}}

Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210AI\u4e2d\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u4f46\u91c7\u6837\u6162\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6bd4\u8fed\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u5feb100\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u95ed\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4Kolmogorov\u6d41\u6570\u503c\u793a\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0e\u5ea6\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301(MP)\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5(GA)\u7ea6\u675f\u4e24\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8fed\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7(100\u500d)\uff1b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u540e\u7684\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u65e2\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u968f\u673a\u95ed\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

It is conceptually and technically distinct from the authors' earlier arXiv works (QTOW/QTOW2), which pursue different formulations of contextuality", "summary": "Adaptive systems often operate across multiple contexts while reusing a fixed internal state space due to constraints on memory, representation, or physical resources. Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure.

The field theory governs the competition between a mass term and an interaction involving the product of $N$ order-parameter fields, which is realized, e.g. in coupled Ising chains, two-leg spin ladders, and SO($N$)-symmetric spin chains. By combining a perturbative renormalization group analysis and large-scale matrix-product state simulations, we systematically determine the nature of the phase transition as a function of $N$. For $N=2$ and $N=3$, we confirm that the transition is continuous, belonging to the Ising and four-state Potts universality classes, respectively. In contrast, for $N \\ge 4$, our results provide compelling evidence that the transition becomes first order. We further apply these findings to specific lattice models with SO($N$) symmetry, including spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ two-leg ladders, that realize a direct transition between an SO($N$) symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase.

Yet, these network circuits are rarely acid-tested for their stability across different instances of the same deep learning architecture.

Here, we systematically study stability across-refits in increasingly complex transformer language models of various sizes. We quantify, layer by layer, how similarly attention heads learn representations across independently initialized training runs. Our rigorous experiments show that (1) middle-layer heads are the least stable yet the most representationally distinct; (2) deeper models exhibit stronger mid-depth divergence; (3) unstable heads in deeper layers become more functionally important than their peers from the same layer; (4) applying weight decay optimization substantially improves attention-head stability across random model initializations; and (5) the residual stream is comparatively stable.

Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility behaviors using structured reasoning, but their high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable efficient large-scale human mobility simulations. It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Experiments show that MobCache significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMobCache\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1MobCache\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u63a8\u7406\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u590d\u7528\u4e0e\u91cd\u7ec4\uff1b(2) \u89e3\u7801\u7ec4\u4ef6\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8\u89c4\u5f8b\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMobCache\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "MobCache\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM-based\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\u3002"}}

For example, the Mermin-Wagner theorem prohibits long-range order in low-dimensional systems beyond the ground state. Here, we show that quantum circuits can learn states of matter with long-range order that are inaccessible in equilibrium. We construct variational quantum circuits that generate symmetry-broken and symmetry-protected topological states with long-range order in one-dimensional systems at finite energy density, where equilibrium states are typically featureless. Importantly, the learned states can exhibit unconventional features with enhanced metrological properties such as a quantum Fisher information close to a GHZ state, but robust against local measurements.

However, many benchmarks quickly become saturated, meaning that they can no longer differentiate between the best-performing models, diminishing their long-term value. In this study, we analyze benchmark saturation across 60 Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks selected from technical reports by major model developers. To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates.

However, achieving sample-efficient test-time self-consistency under a limited budget remains an open challenge. We introduce PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-TimeSelf-Consistency), which initiates a principled study of trajectory allocation through an optimization framework. Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation. On GPQA, PETS achieves perfect self-consistency in both settings while reducing the sampling budget by up to 75% (offline) and 55% (online) relative to uniform allocation.

Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible.

We present a geometric analysis of optimization dynamics in transformers trained on modular arithmetic. PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes. Causal intervention experiments establish that orthogonal gradient flow is necessary but not sufficient for grokking: suppressing it prevents generalization with a monotonic dose-response across four operations, while artificially boosting curvature defects has no effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Transformer\u5728\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u201cgrokking\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6267\u884c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u6b63\u4ea4\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u589e\u957f\u5148\u4e8e\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6cbf\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u662fgrokking\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u7eaf\u589e\u52a0\u66f2\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5f15\u53d1\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301grokking\u662f\u9003\u79bb\u4e9a\u7a33\u6001\u52bf\u9631\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "Grokking\u2014\u2014\u5728\u5c0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ece\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5230\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8f6c\u53d8\u2014\u2014\u4ecd poorly understood\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684 memorization \u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u53ca\u968f\u540e\u7684\u7a81\u7136\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6267\u884c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fde\u7eed\u68af\u5ea6\u6b65\u7684\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\uff08commutator defects\uff09\u4ee5\u63a2\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u66f2\u7387\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u6291\u5236\u6b63\u4ea4\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u589e\u5f3a\u66f2\u7387\uff09\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u5bf9grokking\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u4e8668-83%\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b\u66f2\u7387\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u65b9\u5411\u663e\u8457\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u800c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u57fa\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\uff1b\u66f2\u7387\u589e\u957f\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u524d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u524d\u65f6\u95f4\u968fgrokking\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5448\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6cbf\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u662fgrokking\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u6b63\u4ea4\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u53ef\u963b\u6b62\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u66f2\u7387\u7f3a\u9677\u5bf9grokking\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "Grokking \u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4f4e\u7ef4 confinement \u7684\u4e9a\u7a33\u6001\u52bf\u9631\u4e2d\u9003\u9038\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u6a2a\u5411\u79ef\u7d2f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9003\u79bb\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u9760\u66f2\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e6\u53d1\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3 grokking \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

A Gradient Variance Framework", "comment": null, "summary": "Based on our experimental findings, we propose the following decision framework for practitioners. Quantum annealing is recommended when the problem formulation QUBO exhibits a high gradient variance (greater than 0.3) and the energy landscape contains numerous thin barriers characterized by sharp peaks and narrow valleys. Additionally, quantum approaches are particularly suitable when classical methods are observed to get trapped in local minima, the problem size is manageable given hardware constraints (less than 5000 variables for pure quantum annealing), and the time overhead of approximately 10 seconds is acceptable for the application.\n  In contrast, classical methods are recommended when the gradient variance is low (less than 0.2), indicating smooth landscapes where quantum tunneling provides little advantage. Classical approaches are also preferable when the problem size is small and classical solvers can provide nearly instantaneous results, when solution quality requirements are modest and local optima suffice, or when hardware access or cost is a limiting factor.\n  For problems that exceed pure quantum capacity but possess a favorable landscape structure, hybrid approaches combining quantum and classical techniques are recommended. Such hybrid methods are particularly effective when decomposition quality can be verified and both solution quality and scalability are important considerations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u80fd\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9ad8\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee(>0.3)\u548c\u590d\u6742\u80fd\u666f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\uff0c\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee(<0.2)\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6848", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u6216\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u5f53\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6216\u7ed3\u679c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u4f73", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u80fd\u666f\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\uff09\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50/\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u91cf\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u9608\u503c", "result": "1) \u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee>0.3+\u80fd\u666f\u6709\u7a84\u52bf\u5792+\u53d8\u91cf<5000+\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97>10\u79d2 2) \u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee<0.2+\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21+\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8981\u6c42 3) \u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u8d85\u91cf\u5b50\u5bb9\u91cf\u4f46\u7ed3\u6784\u826f\u597d\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "conclusion": "\u5f62\u6210\u4e09\u5c42\u6b21\u51b3\u7b56\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1a\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u5904\u7406\u5e73\u6ed1\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5357"}}

The genuine nonequilibrium post-quench dynamics allows the system to evolve along effective shortcuts absent in the quasi-static regime. When the time needed for preparing the (classical or quantum) system in the hotter initial state is included, we encounter so-called Pontus-Mpemba effects. We here investigate multi-step Pontus-Mpemba protocols for open quantum systems whose dynamics is governed by time-inhomogeneous Lindblad master equations. In the limit of infinitely many steps, one arrives at continuous Pontus-Mpemba protocols. We study the crossover between the quasi-static and the sudden-quench regime, showing the presence of dynamically generated shortcuts achieved for time-dependent dissipation rates.

As a result, we can readily simulate systems with electron numbers $N > 1000$ on both disk and sphere geometries. We apply this method to investigating the topological shift obtained from the edge dipole moment, computed from the density of the wave function on the disk. We also numerically computed the non-Abelian braiding matrices for different braiding schemes of the Moore-Read quasiholes on the sphere.

We demonstrate a compact, self-calibrating cryogenic noise source based on an on-chip chromium attenuator that can be resistively heated with nanowatt-level power and directly integrated into a coaxial microwave line at the mixing-chamber stage. By comparing Johnson-Nyquist noise generated by Joule and microwave heating, measured through the amplification chain, the attenuation of the input line, and hence the gain of the chain, is determined without requiring knowledge of the attenuator temperature.

A major limitation is that most existing algorithms do not appropriately weight the information from different routers during aggregation, resulting in suboptimal convergence and reduced accuracy. Motivated by traditional weighted triangulation methods, this paper introduces the concept of attention to routers, ensuring that each router's contribution is weighted differently when aggregating information from multiple routers for triangulation. We demonstrate, by incorporating attention layers into a standard machine learning localization architecture, that emphasizing the relevance of each router can substantially improve overall performance.

Data transmission, latency, energy consumption, and dependence on large data centres create bottlenecks that scale poorly across heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce Node Learning, a decen- tralised learning paradigm in which intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and expands through selective peer interaction. Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity. This concept paper develops the conceptual foundations of this paradigm, contrasts it with existing decentralised approaches, and examines implications for communi- cation, hardware, trust, and governance. Node Learning does not discard existing paradigms, but places them within a broader decentralised perspective", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our results show that the transient superradiant burst exhibits the expected peak intensity scaling $I_{\\max}\\!\\sim\\! N^2$, with a universal finite-size correction $|\u03be(N)-2|\\!\\sim\\! 1/\\ln N$ that governs the apparent scaling exponent in realistic ensembles. In the stationary regime, collective broadening modifies the EIT response: although it typically enhances absorption, it counterintuitively increases the group velocity, leading to a relative scaling $v_g\\!\\propto\\! N^2$, even while $v_g\\!\\ll\\! c$. This effect suggests that cooperative interactions fundamentally limit the achievable slow-light delay in dense media. To achieve these results, we derive a representative-atom master equation that quantitatively reproduces both the superradiant and EIT regimes, in excellent agreement with the exact symmetric-subspace dynamics and correctly incorporating collective feedback and $N$-dependent broadening. This unified framework bridges transient superradiant emission and steady-state quantum interference, with direct implications for slow light, quantum memories, and precision metrology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e09\u80fd\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fea\u514b\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0e\u7535\u78c1\u611f\u5e94\u900f\u660e\uff08EIT\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5173\u8054\uff1a\u77ac\u6001\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u5cf0\u5f3a\u9075\u5faaI_max\u221dN\u00b2\u5e76\u5b58\u57281/lnN\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b\u7a33\u6001\u4e0b\u96c6\u4f53\u5c55\u5bbd\u867d\u589e\u5f3a\u5438\u6536\uff0c\u5374\u53cd\u5e38\u5730\u4f7f\u7fa4\u901f\u5ea6\u6309v_g\u221dN\u00b2\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6162\u5149\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7acb\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u53d1\u5c04\u4e0e\u7535\u78c1\u611f\u5e94\u900f\u660e\uff08EIT\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7a20\u5bc6\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u96c6\u4f53\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6162\u5149\u6280\u672f\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5b58\u50a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u539f\u5b50\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\"\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u73b0\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0eEIT\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u96c6\u4f53\u53cd\u9988\u548cN\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c55\u5bbd\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u9ad8\u5ea6\u543b\u5408\u3002", "result": "1) \u77ac\u6001\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u5cf0\u5f3aI_max\u221dN\u00b2\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u666e\u9002\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4fee\u6b63|\u03be(N)-2|\u221d1/lnN\uff1b2) \u7a33\u6001\u4e0b\u96c6\u4f53\u5c55\u5bbd\u4f7f\u7fa4\u901f\u5ea6\u53cd\u5e38\u63d0\u5347\u81f3v_g\u221dN\u00b2\uff08\u5c3d\u7ba1v_g\u226ac\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5408\u4f5c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u6162\u5149\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6 bridging \u77ac\u6001\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0e\u7a33\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7a20\u5bc6\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u5408\u4f5c\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u6162\u5149\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u548c\u7cbe\u5bc6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a unified framework, where each score is explicitly defined with respect to a given order. This order-oriented perspective enables more flexible and coherent scoring mechanisms. We examine several classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements, that is, nonempty subsets in [0,1], and show that, contrary to prior claims, they do not induce lattice structures. In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the G\u00e4rdenfors condition.\n  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements.

This relationship can be clarified by free models, that add to classical computing just enough physical principles to represent quantum computing and no more. Here we develop an axiomatisation of quantum computing that replaces the standard continuous postulates with a small number of discrete equations, as well as a free model that replaces the standard linear-algebraic model with a category-theoretical one. The axioms and model are based on reversible classical computing, isolate quantum advantage in the ability to take certain well-behaved square roots, and link to various quantum computing hardware platforms. This approach allows combinatorial optimisation, including brute force computer search, to optimise quantum computations. The free model may be interpreted as a programming language for quantum computers, that has the same expressivity and computational universality as the standard model, but additionally allows automated verification and reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we describe how distribution shifts in language models can be separated into observable and unobservable components, and we discuss how established approaches for dealing with distribution shift address only the former. Importantly, we identify that the resulting omitted variable bias from unobserved variables can compromise both evaluation and optimization in language models. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework that maps the strength of the omitted variables to bounds on the worst-case generalization performance of language models under distribution shift. In empirical experiments, we show that using these bounds directly in language model evaluation and optimization provides more principled measures of out-of-distribution performance, improves true out-of-distribution performance relative to standard distribution shift adjustment methods, and further enables inference about the strength of the omitted variables when target distribution labels are available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9057\u6f0f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5c06\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u5f3a\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6539\u8fdb"}}

Current QEC controllers execute all scheduled syndrome (parity-bit) measurement rounds before decoding, even when early syndrome data indicates that the run will result in an error. The resulting excess measurements increase the decoder's workload and system latency. To address this, we introduce an adaptive abort module that simultaneously reduces decoder overhead and suppresses logical error rates in surface codes and color codes under an existing QEC controller. The key idea is that initial syndrome information allows the controller to terminate risky shots early before additional resources are spent. An effective scheme balances the cost of further measurement against the restart cost and thus increases decoder efficiency.\n  Adaptive abort schemes dynamically adjust the number of syndrome measurement rounds per shot using real-time syndrome information. We consider three schemes: fixed-depth (FD) decoding (the standard non-adaptive approach used in current state-of-the-art QEC controllers), and two adaptive schemes, AdAbort and One-Step Lookahead (OSLA) decoding. For surface and color codes under a realistic circuit-level depolarizing noise model, AdAbort substantially outperforms both OSLA and FD, yielding higher decoder efficiency across a broad range of code distances. Numerically, as the code distance increases from 5 to 15, AdAbort yields an improvement that increases from 5% to 35% for surface codes and from 7% to 60% for color codes.\n  To our knowledge, these are the first adaptive abort schemes considered for QEC.

While recent work has demonstrated that labeled counterfactual tasks can be useful benchmarks of LLMs' causal reasoning, producing such data at the scale required to cover the vast potential space of counterfactuals is limited. In this work, we introduce double counterfactual consistency (DCC), a lightweight inference-time method for measuring and guiding the ability of LLMs to reason causally. Without requiring labeled counterfactual data, DCC verifies a model's ability to execute two important elements of causal reasoning: causal intervention and counterfactual prediction. Using DCC, we evaluate the causal reasoning abilities of various leading LLMs across a range of reasoning tasks and interventions. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DCC as a training-free test-time rejection sampling criterion and show that it can directly improve performance on reasoning tasks across multiple model families.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u91cd\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08DCC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u96be\u4ee5\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8986\u76d6\u6d77\u91cf\u6f5c\u5728\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u91cd\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08DCC\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528DCC\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u6807\u51c6\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DCC\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Similar performance was then reported using large-scale inference on publicly available models but at prohibitive costs (e.g., 3000 USD per problem). In this work, we present an inference pipeline that attains best-in-class performance on IMO-style math problems at an average inference cost orders of magnitude below competing methods while using only general-purpose off-the-shelf models. Our method relies on insights about grader failure in solver-grader pipelines, which we call the Cognitive Well (iterative refinement converging to a wrong solution that the solver as well as the pipeline's internal grader consider to be basically correct). Our pipeline addresses these failure modes through conjecture extraction, wherein candidate lemmas are isolated from generated solutions and independently verified alongside their negations in a fresh environment (context detachment). On IMO-ProofBench Advanced (PB-Adv), our pipeline achieves 67.1 percent performance using Gemini 3.0 Pro with an average cost per question of approximately 31 USD.

However, current ADKs either lack sufficient functional support or rely on humans to manually design these components, limiting agents' generalizability and overall performance. We propose OpenSage, the first ADK that enables LLMs to automatically create agents with self-generated topology and toolsets while providing comprehensive and structured memory support. OpenSage offers effective functionality for agents to create and manage their own sub-agents and toolkits. It also features a hierarchical, graph-based memory system for efficient management and a specialized toolkit tailored to software engineering tasks. Extensive experiments across three state-of-the-art benchmarks with various backbone models demonstrate the advantages of OpenSage over existing ADKs.

This rule stipulates that when possible past causes are held fixed, the joint probabilities of outcomes of spacelike separated measurements, conditional on measurement settings, be the product of the local conditional probabilities individually. Bell shows that Factorizability conflicts with predictions of QM, predictions since confirmed in many experiments. However, Bell warns his readers that the steps leading to Factorizability should 'be viewed with the utmost suspicion'. He says that 'it is precisely in cleaning up intuitive ideas for mathematics that one is likely to throw the baby out with the bathwater' (1990, 239). Bell's suspicions were well-founded, for he himself misses an important baby. Here we retrieve and identify it: it is selection bias. We explain how failure of Factorizability may be regarded as a selection artefact, requiring no violation of locality in the intuitive, conceptual sense with which Bell begins his analysis. The argument begins with a central principle of causal discovery, Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause (PCC). It is well known that correlations due to selection bias are not subject to PCC. Several writers have proposed that EPR-Bell correlations are also an exception to PCC, but it has not been noticed that they fall under this well-known exclusion. The point is relevant not only to the status of Bell nonlocality, but also for statistics and causal modeling. For these fields, the news is that selection effects play a ubiquitous role in quantum phenomena, in a form akin to collider bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u6311\u6218\u8d1d\u5c14\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8d1d\u5c14\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\"\u5a74\u513f\"\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8d1d\u5c14\u975e\u5b9a\u57df\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u8fdd\u53cd\u5b9a\u57df\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a", "motivation": "\u56de\u5e94\u8d1d\u5c14\u5728\u300a\u65b0\u70f9\u8c03\u6cd5\u300b\u4e2d\u5bf9\"\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u6027\"\u63a8\u5bfc\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u627e\u56de\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\"\u5a74\u513f\"\u2014\u2014\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528", "method": "\u4ece\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5219\u2014\u2014\u8d56\u6b23\u5df4\u8d6b\u5171\u540c\u539f\u56e0\u539f\u5219\uff08PCC\uff09\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u76f8\u5173\u4e0d\u53d7PCC\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06EPR-Bell\u5173\u8054\u5f52\u5165\u6b64\u4f8b\u5916\u8303\u7574", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u6027\u5931\u6548\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u4ea7\u7269\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5bf9\u649e\u504f\u501a\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u9762\u8fdd\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u5b9a\u57df\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u5c14\u975e\u5b9a\u57df\u6027\u4e89\u8bae\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7f3a\u9677\u800c\u975e\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u5728\uff0c\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u91cd\u5851\u5b9a\u57df\u6027\u4e89\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u89d2"}}

Johansson"], "title": "Efficient Tail-Aware Generative Optimization via Flow Model Fine-Tuning", "comment": "33 pages", "summary": "Fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion and flow models to optimize downstream utilities is central to real-world deployment. Existing entropy-regularized methods primarily maximize expected reward, providing no mechanism to shape tail behavior. However, tail control is often essential: the lower tail determines reliability by limiting low-reward failures, while the upper tail enables discovery by prioritizing rare, high-reward outcomes. In this work, we present Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT), a principled and efficient distributional fine-tuning algorithm based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We address two distinct tail-shaping goals: right-CVaR for seeking novel samples in the high-reward tail and left-CVaR for controlling worst-case samples in the low-reward tail.

An iterative Hartmann-Hahn protocol transfers polarization from dense nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to a P1 ensemble, yielding a 740-fold enhancement over room-temperature thermal equilibrium as revealed by differential readout. The resulting mesoscopic P1 spin ensemble exhibits collective Rabi oscillations and long-lived spin-lock and Hahn-echo coherences. We identify a crossover in the saturation polarization arising from the competition between coherent driving and local disorder, providing a quantitative measure of the system's intrinsic disorder.

This lack of temporal awareness facilitates a \"Safety Gap\" where adversarial tactics, like Crescendo and ActorAttack, slowly bleed malicious intent across turn boundaries to bypass stateless filters. We introduce DeepContext, a stateful monitoring framework designed to map the temporal trajectory of user intent. DeepContext discards the isolated evaluation model in favor of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests a sequence of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings. By propagating a hidden state across the conversation, DeepContext captures the incremental accumulation of risk that stateless models overlook. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepContext significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84, which represents a substantial improvement over both hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and leading open-weight models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67).

Here, we combine spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence ($\u03bc$-PL) spectroscopy from cryogenic (4$\\text{-}$94 K) to room temperature with micro-Raman spectroscopy at room temperature to investigate the strain-dependent emission energies of thousands of individual QDs in ML-WS$_2$ and ML-WSe$_2$, integrated across multiple heterostructures and a piezoelectric device. Compared with delocalized excitons, QDs in both materials exhibit enhanced strain sensitivities of their emission energies $-$ approximately fourfold in WS$_2$ and twofold in WSe$_2$ $-$ leading to pronounced broadening of the ensemble emission linewidth. Temperature-dependent $\u03bc$-PL spectroscopy combined with dynamic strain tuning experiments further reveal that the enhanced strain sensitivity of individual QDs originates from strengthened interactions with low-energy phonons induced by quantum confinement. Our results demonstrate a versatile strain-engineering approach with potential for spectral matching across solid-state, atomic, and hybrid quantum photonic networks, and provide new insights into phonon-QD interactions in two-dimensional semiconductors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Strain engineering enhances quantum dot emission energy sensitivity in ML-WS\u2082/WSe\u2082 via phonon confinement for quantum photonics", "motivation": "Exploring strain engineering in 2D semiconductors (ML-TMDs) to tune light-matter interactions and create quantum functionalities like quantum dots (QDs) for quantum photonic networks.", "method": "Combined cryogenic (4-94 K) micro-photoluminescence (\u03bc-PL) and room-temperature micro-Raman spectroscopy to analyze strain-dependent emission of thousands of individual QDs in ML-WS\u2082/WSe\u2082 across heterostructures and piezoelectric devices.", "result": "QDs show enhanced strain sensitivity (4\u00d7 in WS\u2082, 2\u00d7 in WSe\u2082) vs. delocalized excitons, causing broadened ensemble linewidths.

We propose Verbalized Action Masking (VAM), which verbalizes an action mask in the prompt and enforces that the model outputs an action from the masked set. Building on this interface, we introduce iterative action-space pruning: if the target action is not sampled, we remove valid sampled actions from the mask and resample under the reduced candidate set, repeating until the target is sampled or a fixed budget is exhausted. We study VAM in chess and evaluate it under two training regimes: an engine-play regime that generates states via play against an engine opponent and a fixed-dataset regime that trains from a fixed dataset of positions with verifier scores.

Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves.

An Exact Analysis for the Data-driven Newsvendor", "comment": null, "summary": "We study the offline data-driven newsvendor problem with censored demand data. In contrast to prior works where demand is fully observed, we consider the setting where demand is censored at the inventory level and only sales are observed; sales match demand when there is sufficient inventory, and equal the available inventory otherwise. We provide a general procedure to compute the exact worst-case regret of classical data-driven inventory policies, evaluated over all demand distributions. Our main technical result shows that this infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one, enabling an exact characterization of the performance of policies for any sample size and censoring levels. We leverage this reduction to derive sharp insights on the achievable performance of standard inventory policies under demand censoring. In particular, our analysis of the Kaplan-Meier policy shows that while demand censoring fundamentally limits what can be learned from passive sales data, just a small amount of targeted exploration at high inventory levels can substantially improve worst-case guarantees, enabling near-optimal performance even under heavy censoring. In contrast, when the point-of-sale system does not record stockout events and only reports realized sales, a natural and commonly used approach is to treat sales as demand. Our results show that policies based on this sales-as-demand heuristic can suffer severe performance degradation as censored data accumulates, highlighting how the quality of point-of-sale information critically shapes what can, and cannot, be learned offline.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper analyzes the offline newsvendor problem with censored demand data (where only sales are observed, not true demand due to stockouts).

We formalize and challenge this assumption through latent context-conditioned policies -- models whose outputs depend on unobserved internal variables that are rare under evaluation but prevalent under deployment. We establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. (1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error >= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains >= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires O(1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2)) samples, where gamma = alpha_0 + alpha_1 - 1 measures probe quality, and we provide explicit bias correction under probe error.

We propose a Quantum Scrambling Born Machine in which a fixed entangling unitary -- acting as a scrambling reservoir -- provides multi-qubit entanglement, while only single-qubit rotations are optimized. We consider three entangling unitaries -- a Haar random unitary and two physically realizable approximations, a finite-depth brickwork random circuit and analog time evolution under nearest-neighbor spin-chain Hamiltonians -- and show that, for the benchmark distributions and system sizes considered, once the entangler produces near-Haar-typical entanglement the model learns the target distribution with weak sensitivity to the scrambler's microscopic origin. Finally, promoting the Hamiltonian couplings to trainable parameters casts the generative task as a variational Hamiltonian problem, with performance competitive with representative classical generative models at matched parameter count.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u7f6e\u4e71\u73bb\u6069\u673a(QSBM)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ea0\u7f20\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\"\u7f6e\u4e71\u5e93\"\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u65cb\u8f6c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u65e6\u8fbe\u5230\u8fd1Haar\u5178\u578b\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u7f6e\u4e71\u5668\u5fae\u89c2\u7ec6\u8282\u5f31\u654f\u611f\u3002\u5c06\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u540e\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u662f\u8fd1\u671f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u7ea0\u7f20\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7ec6\u8282\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u672a\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u7f6e\u4e71\u73bb\u6069\u673a\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ea0\u7f20\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\uff08\u4e09\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\uff1aHaar\u968f\u673a\u3001\u6709\u9650\u6df1\u5ea6\u7816\u5899\u7535\u8def\u3001\u8fd1\u90bb\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f6e\u4e71\u5e93\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u65cb\u8f6c\u95e8\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u8026\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53d8\u5206\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u7f6e\u4e71\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u8fd1Haar\u5178\u578b\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u5bf9\u7f6e\u4e71\u5668\u5fae\u89c2\u8d77\u6e90\u5f31\u654f\u611f\u3002\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u7816\u5899\u7535\u8def\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u4e0eHaar\u968f\u673a\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u5728\u5339\u914d\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7ecf\u5178\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "QSBM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e3b\u8981\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u7ea0\u7f20\u7a0b\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7f6e\u4e71\u5668\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd1\u671f\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise.

However, existing Text-to-SQL methods are not designed for continuous morphological intents such as shapes or anomalies, while time series models struggle to handle ultra-long histories. To address these challenges, we propose Sonar-TS, a neuro-symbolic framework that tackles NLQ4TSDB via a Search-Then-Verify pipeline. Analogous to active sonar, it utilizes a feature index to ping candidate windows via SQL, followed by generated Python programs to lock on and verify candidates against raw signals.

Observational study with a predictive modeling approach using a cross-sectional design, aimed at estimating the chances of developing dementia, using data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), involving 9,412 participants. Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors. The RF model outperformed logistic regression, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.776, with a sensitivity of 0.708, a specificity of 0.702, an F1-score of 0.311, a G-means of 0.705, and an accuracy of 0.703.

However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the \"non-outlier\" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a \"Sanction Score.\" We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cinder\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff08Ruzicka\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u521d\u7b5b+Kantorovich\u8ddd\u79bb\u7cbe\u8bc4\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u8d28\u6280\u80fd\u9884\u7ec4\u961f\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e1.4\u4ebf\u6b21\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5236\u88c1\u5206\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u6280\u80fd\u503c\u7684\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6280\u80fd\u9884\u7ec4\u961f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u5c40\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5e03\u5bbd\u6cdb\u6216\u504f\u659c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u73a9\u5bb6\u7559\u5b58\u4e0e\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6", "method": "1. \u521d\u7b5b\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528Ruzicka\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u6bd4\u8f83\u9884\u7ec4\u961f\u7684\"\u975e\u79bb\u7fa4\"\u6280\u80fd\u8303\u56f4\uff1b2. \u7cbe\u8bc4\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5c06\u73a9\u5bb6\u6bb5\u4f4d\u6620\u5c04\u81f3\u9006\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6280\u80fd\u6876\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Kantorovich\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\"\u5236\u88c1\u5206\"\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u5c40\u516c\u5e73\u6027", "result": "\u901a\u8fc71.4\u4ebf\u6b21\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u7ec4\u961f\u914d\u5bf9\u5206\u6790\u5236\u88c1\u5206\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u5339\u914d\u9608\u503c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u4f9d\u636e", "conclusion": "Cinder\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5176\u5236\u88c1\u5206\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f02\u8d28\u6280\u80fd\u9884\u7ec4\u961f\u5bf9\u5c40\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027"}}

Focusing on engineered Markovian dissipation, we show that appropriately designed Lindblad jump operators can drive tight-binding systems into highly excited band-edge states, resulting in steady states with large ergotropy. We illustrate this mechanism in a one-dimensional tight-binding chain and in a two-dimensional graphene lattice. We find that disorder enhances the charging power, indicating that dissipation-assisted localization effects can be beneficial for energy storage. Moreover, the dissipative charging process remains robust against additional local dephasing noise. Our results establish bond dissipation as an effective and physically transparent mechanism for charging lattice quantum batteries in realistic open-system settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8017\u6563\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1Lindblad\u8df3\u8dc3\u7b97\u7b26\uff09\u5728\u683c\u70b9\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u8017\u6563\u5145\u7535\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u5165\u9ad8\u80fd\u5e26\u8fb9\u6001\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6709\u6548\u80fd\u91cf\uff08ergotropy\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u65e0\u5e8f\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u683c\u70b9\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u4e3b\u5145\u7535\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5145\u7535\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u5e8f\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u91cf\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8017\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684Lindblad\u8df3\u8dc3\u7b97\u7b26\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u4e00\u7ef4\u7d27\u675f\u7f1a\u94fe\u548c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u6676\u683c\u7b49\u7d27\u675f\u7f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u5165\u9ad8\u80fd\u5e26\u8fb9\u7a33\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u5e8f\u548c\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "1) \u8017\u6563\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5145\u7535\u81f3\u5177\u6709\u9ad8ergotropy\u7684\u7a33\u6001\uff1b2) \u65e0\u5e8f\u53cd\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u5145\u7535\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u8017\u6563\u8f85\u52a9\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7684\u6709\u5229\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b3) \u5145\u7535\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u989d\u5916\u5c40\u90e8\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u566a\u58f0\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u952e\u8017\u6563\uff08bond dissipation\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u683c\u70b9\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u5145\u7535\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u80fd\u6e90\u5668\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The recently proposed Krylov shadow tomography (KST) opens a new avenue for this task by introducing a series of Krylov bounds on the QFI. In this work, we address the practical applicability of the KST, unveiling that the Krylov bounds of low orders already enable efficient and accurate estimation of the QFI. We show that the Krylov bounds converge to the QFI exponentially fast with increasing order and can surpass the state-of-the-art polynomial lower bounds known to date. Moreover, we show that certain low-order Krylov bound can already match the QFI exactly for low-rank states prevalent in practical settings.

A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \\emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^\u03c0$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($\u03a0(\u03c0)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $\u03a0(\u03c0)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $\u03c1(E^{\\mathrm{s}}+E^{\\mathrm{a}}\u03a0(\u03c0)) < 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. Finally, we leverage this theory to analyze a provably-sound localized block-coordinate policy improvement framework with guarantees tied directly to this spectral radius.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u6027\u8d28(EDP)\u6761\u4ef6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5728\u5f3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u8026\u5408\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6761\u4ef6\u03c1(E^s+E^a\u03a0(\u03c0))<1\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5757\u5750\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8eEDP\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6761\u4ef6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8fb9\u754c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u77e9\u9635H^\u03c0\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u9896\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5c06\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001(E^s)\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c(E^a)\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6(\u03a0(\u03c0))\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5149\u8c31\u6761\u4ef6\u03c1(E^s + E^a\u03a0(\u03c0)) < 1\uff0c\u8be5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e25\u683c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8303\u6570\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5757\u5750\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u8be5\u5149\u8c31\u534a\u5f84\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6743\u8861\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55MARL\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u6307\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Existing approaches, from RL-based planners to trajectory retrieval, often drift from user intent and repeatedly solve routine subproblems, leading to error accumulation and inefficiency. We present IntentCUA, a multi-agent computer-use framework designed to stabilize long-horizon execution through intent-aligned plan memory. A Planner, Plan-Optimizer, and Critic coordinate over shared memory that abstracts raw interaction traces into multi-view intent representations and reusable skills. At runtime, intent prototypes retrieve subgroup-aligned skills and inject them into partial plans, reducing redundant re-planning and mitigating error propagation across desktop applications. In end-to-end evaluations, IntentCUA achieved a 74.83% task success rate with a Step Efficiency Ratio of 0.91, outperforming RL-based and trajectory-centric baselines. Ablations show that multi-view intent abstraction and shared plan memory jointly improve execution stability, with the cooperative multi-agent loop providing the largest gains on long-horizon tasks.

In our experiment, the prepared quantum states are high-dimensional orbital angular momentum states of single photons, and both the preparation fidelity and the measurement fidelity are about 99.0$\\%$ for the six-dimensional quantum states.

Whether this mechanism extends beyond arithmetic remains open. We study two sequence-learning benchmarks: SCAN compositional generalization and Dyck-1 depth prediction. Across both tasks and a wide range of learning rates, the commutator defect -- a curvature measure derived from non-commuting gradient updates -- rises well before generalization, with lead times following a superlinear power law (alpha approximately 1.18 for SCAN, approximately 1.13 for Dyck), consistent with prior results on modular arithmetic. Weight-space PCA reveals that spectral concentration is not a universal precursor; the commutator defect is. Causal interventions demonstrate a mechanistic role: amplifying non-commutativity accelerates grokking (roughly 32% on SCAN, roughly 50% on Dyck), while suppressing orthogonal gradient flow delays or prevents it. The three task families form a spectrum of causal sensitivity -- modular arithmetic is rigid, Dyck is responsive, SCAN is intermediate -- yet suppression delays or prevents grokking in all cases, establishing necessity as a universal finding. These results identify the commutator defect as a robust, architecture-agnostic, causally implicated early-warning signal for delayed generalization in transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ece\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5230\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\"\u987f\u609f\"(grokking)\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0 commutator defect\uff08\u7531\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\uff09\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u524d\u663e\u8457\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u524d\u91cf\u9075\u5faa\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u5e42\u5f8b\u3002\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u987f\u609f\uff0c\u800c\u6291\u5236\u6b63\u4ea4\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5219\u4f1a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u963b\u6b62\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e commutator defect \u662f transformer \u4e2d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u901a\u7528\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u987f\u609f\u73b0\u8c61\u5df2\u5728\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u88ab\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u5f62\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u4ecd\u662f\u672a\u89e3\u4e4b\u8c1c\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22 commutator defect \u662f\u5426\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u987f\u609f\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u901a\u7528\u524d\u5146\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1aSCAN\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u548cDyck-1\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684 commutator defect \u548c\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4PCA\u8c31\u96c6\u4e2d\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u589e\u5f3a\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u6216\u6291\u5236\u6b63\u4ea4\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff09\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u673a\u5236\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0ccommutator defect \u5747\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u524d\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u63d0\u524d\u91cf\u670d\u4ece\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u5e42\u5f8b\uff08SCAN \u03b1\u22481.18\uff0cDyck \u03b1\u22481.13\uff09\u3002\u8c31\u96c6\u4e2d\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u524d\u5146\uff0c\u800c commutator defect \u662f\u3002\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u589e\u5f3a\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u4f7fSCAN\u4efb\u52a1\u987f\u609f\u52a0\u901f\u7ea632%\uff0cDyck\u4efb\u52a1\u52a0\u901f\u7ea650%\uff1b\u6291\u5236\u6b63\u4ea4\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5728\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u963b\u6b62\u987f\u609f\u3002", "conclusion": "commutator defect \u662f transformer \u5ef6\u8fdf\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u65cf\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u987f\u609f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While existing approaches encode refusal behaviors across multiple latent features, suppressing a single dominant feature$-$via prompt-based jailbreaks$-$can cause alignment to collapse, leading to unsafe generation. Motivated by this, we propose fail-closed alignment as a design principle for robust LLM safety: refusal mechanisms should remain effective even under partial failures via redundant, independent causal pathways. We present a concrete instantiation of this principle: a progressive alignment framework that iteratively identifies and ablates previously learned refusal directions, forcing the model to reconstruct safety along new, independent subspaces. Across four jailbreak attacks, we achieve the strongest overall robustness while mitigating over-refusal and preserving generation quality, with small computational overhead. Our mechanistic analyses confirm that models trained with our method encode multiple, causally independent refusal directions that prompt-based jailbreaks cannot suppress simultaneously, providing empirical support for fail-closed alignment as a principled foundation for robust LLM safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u5931\u6548\u5173\u95ed\"\u5bf9\u9f50\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u91cd\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\"\u5931\u6548\u5f00\u542f\"\u673a\u5236\u6613\u88ab jailbreak \u653b\u51fb\u7a81\u7834\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u73b0\u4ee3\u62d2\u7edd\u673a\u5236\u662f\"\u5931\u6548\u5f00\u542f\"\u7684\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u6291\u5236\u5355\u4e2a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5373\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u5931\u6548\u5173\u95ed\"\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f\u5c11\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u786e\u8ba4\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5931\u6548\u5173\u95ed\u5bf9\u9f50\u539f\u5219\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684LLM\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u63d0\u793a\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

Accepted to ICLR 2026", "summary": "Value decomposition is a core approach for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods still rely on a single optimal action and struggle to adapt when the underlying value function shifts during training, often converging to suboptimal policies. To address this limitation, we propose Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q), which learns multiple sub-value functions to retain alternative high-value actions. Incorporating these sub-value functions into a Softmax-based behavior policy, S2Q encourages persistent exploration and enables $Q^{\\text{tot}}$ to adjust quickly to the changing optima. Experiments on challenging MARL benchmarks confirm that S2Q consistently outperforms various MARL algorithms, demonstrating improved adaptability and overall performance.

We present UniLeak, a mechanistic-interpretability framework that identifies universal activation directions: latent directions in a model's residual stream whose linear addition at inference time consistently increases the likelihood of generating PII across prompts. These model-specific directions generalize across contexts and amplify PII generation probability, with minimal impact on generation quality. UniLeak recovers such directions without access to training data or groundtruth PII, relying only on self-generated text.

While prior work has proposed various verification algorithms for i.i.d rollouts, their relative performance under matched settings remains unclear. In this work, we firstly present a systematic evaluation of verification strategies across model families, tasks, and sampling regimes, and find that Traversal Verification dominates consistently, with OT-based methods lagging far behind. Our analysis uncovers that this occurs because OT-based methods achieve high multi-token acceptance near the root of the draft tree, while multi-token gains are most impactful deeper in the draft tree, where draft and target distributions diverge. Based on this insight, we propose delayed tree expansion, which drafts a partial single path, delaying the i.i.d. branching point.

We uncover a global scenario controlled by a subcritical Hopf bifurcation and a saddle-node of limit cycles, which together generate a finite coexistence window. In this window, skin modes and extended states are both stable at a fixed energy $E$, separated by a nonlinear basin separatrix in phase space rather than a spectral (mobility-edge) mechanism in a linear system. An averaged amplitude equation yields closed-form predictions for the limit-cycle branches and the SNLC threshold. Building on the basin geometry, we introduce a basin-fraction order parameter that exhibits a first-order-like jump at SNLC. Intriguing physical phenomena in the coexistence window are also revealed, such as separatrix-induced long-lived spatial transients and hysteresis. Overall, our findings highlight that, beyond linear spectral concepts, global attractor-basin geometry provides a powerful and complementary lens for understanding stationary states in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Successful decentralized decision-making often depends not only on good individual actions, but on selecting compatible actions across agents to synchronize behavior, avoid conflicts, and satisfy global constraints. In this paper, we propose Action Graph Policies (AGP), that model dependencies among agents' available action choices. It constructs, what we call, \\textit{coordination contexts}, that enable agents to condition their decisions on global action dependencies. Theoretically, we show that AGPs induce a strictly more expressive joint policy compared to fully independent policies and can realize coordinated joint actions that are provably more optimal than greedy execution even from centralized value-decomposition methods. Empirically, we show that AGP achieves 80-95\\% success on canonical coordination tasks with partial observability and anti-coordination penalties, where other MARL methods reach only 10-25\\%.

We employ two methods to construct the Hilbert space: Method A, based on the standard second-quantization formalism, and Method B, based on a non-standard approach. By eliminating redundant quantum states, we obtain a reduced Hilbert space with significantly lower dimensionality, thereby improving the efficiency of numerical simulations. In a closed system, the two methods are equivalent, and their unitary evolution results are identical. The probability distribution diffuses outward from the center and exhibits a significant rebound after reaching the boundary. In an open system, Method B, by incorporating more dissipation channels, provides a more accurate description of the photon escape process at the boundary. The probability curves obtained from the two methods completely overlap before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, a slight difference appears, but this difference does not amplify with evolution and tends to converge in the later stage. Method B yields a slightly higher dissipative-state probability, indicating that the photon escapes faster. Visualization of the two-dimensional probability distribution shows that the three scenarios (closed system, open system with Method A, and open system with Method B) exhibit identical probability distributions before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, the open systems exhibit significant probability loss, which increases rapidly with evolution. The probability distribution patterns of the two open systems are highly similar, exhibiting synchronized evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5e73\u9762\u4e2d\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u5728\u95ed\u5408\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1a\u6807\u51c6\u4e8c\u6b21\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08A\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08B\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5254\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u83b7\u5f97\u7ef4\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u7ea6\u5316\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5728\u95ed\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u5e7a\u6b63\u6f14\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4ece\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5411\u5916\u6269\u6563\u5e76\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u51fa\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u53cd\u5f39\uff1b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cB\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u8017\u6563\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u5149\u5b50\u9003\u9038\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6982\u7387\u66f2\u7ebf\u5728\u5230\u8fbe\u8fb9\u754c\u524d\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5230\u8fbe\u8fb9\u754c\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\u8f7b\u5fae\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u968f\u6f14\u5316\u653e\u5927\u4e14\u540e\u671f\u8d8b\u4e8e\u6536\u655b\uff0cB\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u8017\u6563\u6001\u6982\u7387\u7565\u9ad8\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5149\u5b50\u9003\u9038\u66f4\u5feb\u3002\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e09\u79cd\u60c5\u5f62\u5728\u5230\u8fbe\u8fb9\u754c\u524d\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u5230\u8fbe\u540e\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u51fa\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6982\u7387\u635f\u5931\u4e14\u968f\u6f14\u5316\u8fc5\u901f\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u6f14\u5316\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u5316\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u4e8c\u6b21\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u95ed\u5408/\u5f00\u653e\u8fb9\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u540c\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u8017\u6563\u5bf9\u5149\u5b50\u9003\u9038\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u79cd\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aA\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u4e8c\u6b21\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1bB\u4e3a\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5747\u5254\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u6001\u5f97\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ea6\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u5206\u522b\u5728\u95ed\u5408\u4e0e\u5f00\u653e\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6a21\u62df\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u95ed\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u4e24\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u5e7a\u6b63\u6f14\u5316\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u6982\u7387\u5411\u5916\u6269\u6563\u5e76\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u53cd\u5f39\uff1b\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1aB\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u66f4\u591a\u8017\u6563\u901a\u9053\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u5149\u5b50\u9003\u9038\u3002\u4e24\u65b9\u6cd5\u6982\u7387\u66f2\u7ebf\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u524d\u91cd\u5408\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\u8f7b\u5fae\u5dee\u5f02\u4f46\u4e0d\u653e\u5927\u4e14\u540e\u671f\u6536\u655b\uff0cB\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u6563\u6001\u6982\u7387\u7565\u9ad8\uff0c\u5149\u5b50\u9003\u9038\u66f4\u5feb\u3002\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793a\u4e09\u60c5\u5f62\u8fb9\u754c\u524d\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c\u540e\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6982\u7387\u635f\u5931\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u8fc5\u901f\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e24\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u5e03\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ea6\u5316\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u62df\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cB\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u66f4\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u8017\u6563\u800c\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u5149\u5b50\u9003\u9038\uff1b\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u524d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u540e\u671f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002B\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Building on this equivalence, we introduce a unified and variance-aware hybrid estimator that adaptively combines pathwise and Malliavin gradients using their empirical covariance structure. The resulting formulation provides a principled understanding of stochastic backpropagation and achieves minimum variance among all unbiased linear combinations, with closed-form finite-sample convergence bounds. We demonstrate 9% variance reduction on VAEs (CIFAR-10) and up to 35% on strongly-coupled synthetic problems. Exploratory policy gradient experiments reveal that non-stationary optimization landscapes present challenges for the hybrid approach, highlighting important directions for future work. Overall, this work positions Malliavin calculus as a conceptually unifying and practically interpretable framework for stochastic gradient estimation, clarifying when hybrid approaches provide tangible benefits and when they face inherent limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684Malliavin\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8def\u5f84\u5fae\u5206\u548c\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df7\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5728VAE\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b09%\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fbe35%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u4f18\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7acb\u8def\u5f84\u5fae\u5206\uff08\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff09\u548c\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff08Malliavin\uff09\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u968f\u673a\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e24\u79cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5747\u6e90\u4e8eMalliavin\u5206\u90e8\u79ef\u5206\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u8def\u5f84\u5fae\u5206\u548cMalliavin\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u95ed\u5f0f\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6536\u655b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u6240\u6709\u65e0\u504f\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b\u5728CIFAR-10 VAE\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b09%\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe35%\u7f29\u51cf\uff1b\u4f46\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u4f18\u5316\u573a\u666f\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "Malliavin\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u5b9e\u8df5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels.

Here, we investigate whether sets of quantum measurements can be modelled by using only devices that are operationally classical, in the sense that they have no superposition properties. This leads us to propose classical measurement models, which we show to be stronger than commutative measurements but weaker than joint measurability. We determine both the exact depolarisation noise rate and the measurement loss rate at which the all projective measurements in $d$-dimensional quantum theory admit a classical model. For finite sets of quantum measurements we develop methods both for constructing classical models and for falsifying the existence of such model via prepare-and-measure setups. Furthermore, we show that this concept also has operational implications. For that, we consider whether quantum measurements with classical side-information can be implemented in sequence without causing a disturbance and we show that classical models imply an affirmative answer.

However, since the objective is defined relative to a group of sampled trajectories, extended deliberation can create more chances to realize relative gains, leading to inefficient reasoning and overthinking, and complicating the trade-off between correctness and rollout efficiency. Controlling this behavior is difficult in practice, considering (i) Length penalties are hard to calibrate because longer rollouts may reflect harder problems that require longer reasoning, penalizing tokens risks truncating useful reasoning along with redundant continuation; and (ii) supervision that directly indicates when to continue or stop is typically unavailable beyond final answer correctness. We propose Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO), which improves rollout efficiency by converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories. Unlike global length penalties that are hard to calibrate, WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals that indicate when additional continuation is beneficial. Thus, WS-GRPO supplies outcome-derived continue/stop guidance, reducing redundant deliberation while maintaining accuracy. We provide theoretical results and empirically show on reasoning benchmarks that WS-GRPO substantially reduces rollout length while remaining competitive with GRPO baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "WS-GRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u7ed3\u679c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ee7\u7eed/\u505c\u6b62\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u8fdb\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9GRPO\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6269\u5c55deliberation\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u96be\u4ee5\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u622a\u65ad\u6709\u7528\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9664\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5916\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u6307\u793a\u4f55\u65f6\u7ee7\u7eed\u6216\u505c\u6b62\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0erollout\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684WS-GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff08\u7ec8\u7aef\u5956\u52b1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6307\u793a\u4f55\u65f6\u7ee7\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u7ec8\u7aef\u5956\u52b1\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u7ee7\u7eed/\u505c\u6b62\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eWS-GRPO\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11rollout\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0eGRPO\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "WS-GRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4ece\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59deliberation\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Capturing these dependencies is critical for identifying students' knowledge gaps and enabling targeted intervention for personalized learning. This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like \"Algorithms\" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., \"part-of\" or \"depends-on\" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., \"recursion\" is taught before \"mergesort\"; \"recursion\" is mentioned in the definition of \"merge sort\") with the generalizability of large language models. Through experiments on real-world, diverse lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, we demonstrate that InstructKG captures rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions.", "AI": {"tldr": "InstructKG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bb2\u4e49\u6750\u6599\u6784\u5efa\u6559\u5b66\u5bfc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u6750\u6599\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u7684\u5148\u4fee\u548c\u5b50\u6982\u5ff5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6559\u5e08\u96be\u4ee5\u8bca\u65ad\u5b66\u751f\u4e2a\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u4e8e\u8868\u5c42\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u89c6\u6559\u5b66\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u6559\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u9884\u671f\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84", "method": "\u4ece\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bb2\u4e49\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u91cd\u8981\u6982\u5ff5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\"\u4f9d\u8d56-\u88ab\u4f9d\u8d56\"\u6216\"\u90e8\u5206-\u6574\u4f53\"\u5173\u7cfb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u8fb9\uff1b\u878d\u5408\u6559\u80b2\u6750\u6599\u7279\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u6559\u5b66\u987a\u5e8f\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u5b9a\u4e49\u5f15\u7528\uff09\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bb2\u4e49\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cInstructKG\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u6559\u5b66\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb", "conclusion": "InstructKG\u4e3a\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u6559\u5b66\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u5b66\u751f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e72\u9884"}}

Among existing approaches, variational quantum algorithms and quantum annealing dominate current research; however, both typically rely on one-hot encodings that severely limit scalability. Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) was recently introduced as an alternative paradigm that reduces qubit requirements by embedding problem variables into Pauli correlations. Despite its promise, PCE has not yet been studied in the context of constrained optimization. In this work, we extend the PCE framework to constrained combinatorial optimization problems and evaluate its performance across multiple problem sizes. Our results show that the standard PCE formulation struggles to reliably enforce constraints, which motivates the introduction of the Iterative-$\u03b1$ PCE. This iterative strategy significantly improves solution quality, achieving consistent constraint satisfaction while yielding better cut sizes across a wide range of instances. These findings highlight both the limitations of current PCE formulations for constrained problems and the effectiveness of iterative strategies for advancing quantum optimization in the NISQ era.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6ce1\u5229\u76f8\u5173\u7f16\u7801(PCE)\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6PCE\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u6267\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u8fed\u4ee3-$\u03b1$ PCE\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\u548c\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u72ec\u70ed\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1bPCE\u867d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76", "method": "\u5c06PCE\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7ea6\u675f\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8fed\u4ee3-$\u03b1$ PCE\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7ea6\u675f\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u6807\u51c6PCE\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u8fed\u4ee3-$\u03b1$ PCE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5207\u5272\u89c4\u6a21", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dPCE\u516c\u5f0f\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u8fdbNISQ\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u53d1\u5c55"}}

Also, we introduce novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition model, which allows for more seamless pattern discovery from the heterogeneous data in our application. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed pipeline experimentally, showcasing its superior performance compared to what is standard practice in the domain, as well as against reasonable ML baselines that do not fall under the ICL paradigm, to ensure that we are not compromising performance in our quest for a seamless and easy-to-use interface for domain experts.

We compare quantum trajectories with full density-matrix simulations, analyzing the dynamics of averaged trajectory entanglement (TE) and operator entanglement (OE), in the respective state representation. Although not a genuine entanglement measure, both TE and OE are connected to the efficiency of matrix product state simulations and thus of fundamental interest. As in many quantum algorithms, at the end of the Grover circuit entanglement decreases as the system converges towards the target product state. While we find that this is well captured in the OE dynamics, quantum trajectories rarely follow paths of reducing entanglement. Optimized unraveling schemes can lower TE slightly, however we show that deep in the circuit OE is generally smaller than TE. This implies that matrix product density operator (MPDO) simulations of quantum circuits can in general be more efficient than quantum trajectories.

However, as the volume of unique IDs expands, traditional hash-based indexing methods suffer from collisions that degrade model performance and personalization quality. We present Multi-Probe Zero Collision Hash (MPZCH), a novel indexing mechanism based on linear probing that effectively mitigates embedding collisions. With reasonable table sizing, it often eliminates these collisions entirely while maintaining production-scale efficiency. MPZCH utilizes auxiliary tensors and high-performance CUDA kernels to implement configurable probing and active eviction policies. By retiring obsolete IDs and resetting reassigned slots, MPZCH prevents the stale embedding inheritance typical of hash-based methods, ensuring new features learn effectively from scratch. Despite its collision-mitigation overhead, the system maintains training QPS and inference latency comparable to existing methods. Rigorous online experiments demonstrate that MPZCH achieves zero collisions for user embeddings and significantly improves item embedding freshness and quality.

We illustrate general conclusions by explicit calculations for Gaussian beams and wavepackets, and also highlight subtleties of the quantum-mechanical description based on the 'photon wavefunction'.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\u6ce2\u5305\u5728\u76f4\u7ebf\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u6ce2\u5305\u5fc5\u7136\u5177\u6709\u4e9a\u5149\u901f\u7684\u7fa4\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8d85\u5149\u901f\u7684\u76f8\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u8005\u4e58\u79ef\u7b49\u4e8ec\u00b2\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u6ce2\u5305\u8ba1\u7b97\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\"\u5149\u5b50\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\"\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\u6ce2\u5305\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f20\u64ad\u65f6\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u901f\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7fa4\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u76f8\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u7269\u7406\u672c\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u6f84\u6e05\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\"\u5149\u5b50\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\"\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6807\u91cf\u6ce2\u5305\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66 formalism \u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u675f\u548c\u6ce2\u5305\u8fdb\u884c\u5177\u4f53\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86Milton\u548cSchwinger\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\"\u80fd\u91cf\u901f\u5ea6\"\u4e0e\"\u52a8\u91cf\u901f\u5ea6\"\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u6ce2\u5305\u5fc5\u7136\u6ee1\u8db3\uff1a\u7fa4\u901f\u5ea6\uff08\u4e9a\u5149\u901f\uff09 \u00d7 \u76f8\u901f\u5ea6\uff08\u8d85\u5149\u901f\uff09 = c\u00b2\uff1b\u8be5\u901f\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u5e94\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u52a8\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u5ea6\uff1b\u9ad8\u65af\u6ce2\u5305\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u4f8b\u652f\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\u6ce2\u5305\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7279\u6027 inherently \u8981\u6c42\u7fa4\u76f8\u901f\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u4e14\u4e58\u79ef\u4e3ac\u00b2\uff1b\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u63cf\u8ff0\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u5904\u7406\"\u5149\u5b50\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\"\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8bef\u89e3\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u5149\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, learned sign matrices resist low-rank approximation and are spectrally indistinguishable from an i.i.d. Rademacher baseline. Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7b26\u53f7\u4f4d\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u5f0f\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u800c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7b26\u53f7\u9501\u5b9a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95f4\u9699\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0e\u5916\u6f02\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u964d\u81f310\u207b\u00b3\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a01\u70b9\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u6743\u91cd\u5e45\u503c\u88ab\u9ad8\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u540e\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u4f4d\u6210\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u968f\u673a\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3b\u8981\u7ee7\u627f\u81ea\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u7b26\u53f7\u9501\u5b9a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5bf9SGD\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7ffb\u8f6c\u8fdb\u884c\u505c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u95f4\u9699\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5916\u6f02\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9650\u5b9a\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u7a00\u6709\u518d\u8fdb\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u7ffb\u8f6c\u5448\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u5c3e\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6709\u6548\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u7ea610\u207b\u00b3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u9020\u6210\u7ea61\u70b9\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u9501\u5b9a\u7406\u8bba\u53ca\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u7a81\u7834\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u4f4d\u74f6\u9888\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines.

Mannheim"], "title": "States that grow linearly in time, exceptional points, and zero norm states in the simple harmonic oscillator", "comment": "7 pages, revtex 4", "summary": "The simple harmonic oscillator has a well-known normalizable, positive energy, bound state spectrum. We show that degenerate with each such positive energy eigenvalue there is a non-normalizable positive energy eigenstate whose eigenfunction is orthogonal to that of the standard energy eigenfunction. This class of states is not built on the vacuum that $a$ annihilates, but is instead built on the vacuum that $a^{\\dagger} a$ annihilates. These non-normalizable but nonetheless stationary energy eigenstates are accompanied by yet another set of non-normalizable states, states whose wave functions however are not stationary but instead grow linearly in time. With these states not being energy eigenstates, the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian is incomplete; with the full Hilbert space containing states that are not energy eigenstates. Thus each energy eigenvalue of the harmonic oscillator is an exceptional point at which the Hamiltonian becomes of non-diagonalizable, and thus manifestly non-Hermitian, Jordan-block form. Such non-Hermitian structures occur for Hamiltonians that have an antilinear $PT$ symmetry. As is characteristic of such systems, one can construct a probability conserving inner product that despite the linear in time growth is nonetheless time independent, and not only that, it leads to states with zero norm. In addition, as is again characteristic of $PT$ symmetry, these non-normalizable states can be made normalizable by a continuation into a so-called Stokes wedge domain in the complex plane. In this domain one has a completely consistent quantum theory, one that lives alongside the standard normalizable energy eigenspectrum sector.

However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts. This coordinated design enables selective disruption of target-specific representations while preserving shared semantic structures. As a result, MeGU enables controlled and selective forgetting, effectively mitigating both under-unlearning and over-unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51faMeGU\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6982\u5ff5\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u91cd\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u8d1f\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u9057\u5fd8\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\"\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\"\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u50ac\u751f\u4e86\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u7136\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u9762\u4e34\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5730\u64e6\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u4fdd\u5b88\u7b56\u7565\u5219\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f7b\u5e95\u6d88\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u606f\u6b8b\u7559\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u673a\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u9057\u5fd8\uff08MeGU\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u8bed\u4e49\u6270\u52a8\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u786e\u5b9a\u91cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u5411\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7c7b\u95f4\u6982\u5ff5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u8d1f\u7279\u5f81\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u8d1f\u5411\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6b63\u5411\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5316\u5269\u4f59\u5173\u8054\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e\u6270\u52a8\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "MeGU\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6b20\u9057\u5fd8\uff08\u6b8b\u7559\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u548c\u8fc7\u9057\u5fd8\uff08\u635f\u5bb3\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0cMeGU\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In early fault-tolerant regimes, logical measurements remain costly, motivating adaptive, shot-frugal state-preparation strategies that efficiently utilize each measurement. We introduce the Shadow Enhanced Greedy Quantum Eigensolver (SEGQE) as a greedy, shadow-assisted framework for measurement-efficient ground-state preparation. SEGQE uses classical shadows to evaluate, in parallel and entirely in classical post-processing, the energy reduction induced by large collections of local candidate gates, greedily selecting at each step the gate with the largest estimated energy decrease. We derive rigorous worst-case per-iteration sample-complexity bounds for SEGQE, exhibiting logarithmic dependence on the number of candidate gates. Numerical benchmarks on finite transverse-field Ising models and ensembles of random local Hamiltonians demonstrate convergence in a number of iterations that scales approximately linearly with system size, while maintaining high-fidelity ground-state approximations and competitive energy estimates. Together, our empirical scaling laws and rigorous per-iteration guarantees establish SEGQE as a measurement-efficient state-preparation primitive well suited to early fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSEGQE\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u589e\u5f3a\u8d2a\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u672c\u5f81\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u9634\u5f71\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d4b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u5236\u5907\uff0c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u91c7\u6837\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u8fed\u4ee3\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u6001\u5236\u5907\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u5bb9\u9519\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5b50\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e2d\u903b\u8f91\u6d4b\u91cf\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u8282\u7701\u6d4b\u91cf\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5236\u5907\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSEGQE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u9634\u5f71\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5e76\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u91cf\u5c40\u57df\u5019\u9009\u95e8\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u8d2a\u5fc3\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u5927\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6bcf\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b65\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u91c7\u6837\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u95e8\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u5bf9\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u5728\u6a2a\u5411\u573aIsing\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5c40\u57df\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u57fa\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "SEGQE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6d4b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u5236\u5907\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u65e9\u671f\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations.

Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLoRG is a federated fine-tuning framework that uses a single low-rank matrix and Gram matrix aggregation to eliminate aggregation errors and decomposition drift, achieving better accuracy and up to 2041\u00d7 lower communication overhead than LoRA-based federated learning methods.", "motivation": "Current federated fine-tuning with LoRA faces two key challenges: (1) errors from separately aggregating two low-rank matrices, and (2) non-unique matrix decomposition causing drift when aggregating the product.

This is the case for a canonical problem: estimating the amplitude and frequency of an AC magnetic field, where the generators are parallel to each other. Here, we introduce a quantum control protocol that resolves this singularity.

ICAD '26", "summary": "This paper presents a serverless MLOps framework orchestrating the complete ML lifecycle from data ingestion, training, deployment, monitoring, and retraining to using event-driven pipelines and managed services. The architecture is model-agnostic, supporting diverse inference patterns through standardized interfaces, enabling rapid adaptation without infrastructure overhead. We demonstrate practical applicability through an industrial implementation for Harmonized System (HS) code prediction, a compliance-critical task where short, unstructured product descriptions are mapped to standardized codes used by customs authorities in global trade. Frequent updates and ambiguous descriptions make classification challenging, with errors causing shipment delays and financial losses. Our solution uses a custom text embedding encoder and multiple deep learning architectures, with Text-CNN achieving 98 percent accuracy on ground truth data. Beyond accuracy, the pipeline ensures reproducibility, auditability, and SLA adherence under variable loads via auto-scaling. A key feature is automated A/B testing, enabling dynamic model selection and safe promotion in production. Cost-efficiency drives model choice; while transformers may achieve similar accuracy, their long-term operational costs are significantly higher. Deterministic classification with predictable latency and explainability is prioritized, though the architecture remains extensible to transformer variants and LLM-based inference.

In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MedClarify\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u8ddf\u8fdb\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8bca\u65ad\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8627\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u50cf\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u90a3\u6837\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u95ee\u8bca\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u6392\u9664\u9274\u522b\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u7ed9\u51fa\u591a\u4e2a\u76f8\u4f3c\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u8ddf\u8fdb\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMedClarify AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5148\u8ba1\u7b97\u9274\u522b\u8bca\u65ad\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4e3b\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8ddf\u8fdb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u9884\u671f\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9996\u5148\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u533b\u7597\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u5355\u6b21LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u53ef\u5c06\u8bca\u65ad\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea627\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "MedClarify\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfb\u6c42\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u533b\u7597LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u8fed\u4ee3\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3002"}}

Current 3D reconstruction-based simulators typically rely on explicit, step-wise updates, which are sensitive to step time and suffer from rapid accuracy degradation under complicated scenarios, such as high-stiffness materials or quasi-static movement. To address this, we introduce i-PhysGaussian, a framework that couples 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with an implicit Material Point Method (MPM) integrator. Unlike explicit methods, our solution obtains an end-of-step state by minimizing a momentum-balance residual through implicit Newton-type optimization with a GMRES solver.

We propose a dataless approach by framing regularization against representation drift as a curvature matrix approximation problem. This allows us to leverage well-established techniques; in particular, we adopt Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature and obtain a practical regularizer that achieves state-of-the-art results in task addition and negation. Our method has constant complexity in the number of tasks and promotes robustness to task vector rescaling, eliminating the need for held-out tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample. These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure. In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space. TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Notably, it yields 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset.

While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ec4\u5408\u53ca\u7cbe\u786e\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff09\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u800c\u975e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u68c0\u67e5\u6bcf\u4e2a\u539f\u5b50\u4e8b\u5b9e\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u8fd4\u56de\u5339\u914d\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6807\u8bb0\u5177\u4f53\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6ee1\u8db3\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u95ee\u8d23\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Our key insight is that, from the neural network's viewpoint, performing quantization primarily manifests as injecting a structured perturbation in latent space. Accordingly, VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with distribution-consistent and scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis--Hastings sampling. This design enables stable training without a codebook while making the model robust to inference-time quantization error. Moreover, under the assumption of approximately uniform latent variables, we derive FSP (Finite Scalar Perturbation), a lightweight variant of VP-VAE that provides a unified theoretical explanation and a practical improvement for FSQ-style fixed quantizers.

This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models.

However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u513f\u7ae5\u4f7f\u7528AI\u6280\u672f\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8ePrivacy-by-Design\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408GDPR\u3001COPPA\u7b49\u6cd5\u89c4\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6620\u5c04\u5230LLM\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff08\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408UNCRC\u548cAADC\u7b49\u513f\u7ae5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a13\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u513f\u7ae5\u6559\u80b2\u8f85\u5bfc\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u964d\u4f4e\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u513f\u7ae5\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f7f\u7528AI\u9a71\u52a8\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2aPrivacy-by-Design\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408GDPR\u3001PIPEDA\u3001COPPA\u7b49\u6cd5\u89c4\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6620\u5c04\u5230LLM\u5e94\u7528\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7eb3\u5165UNCRC\u3001AADC\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u513f\u7ae5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u80b2\u8f85\u5bfc\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8df5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9AI\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u63a7\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u9002\u9f84\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u4e14\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u513f\u7ae5AI\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728LLM\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5b9e\u65bd\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u521b\u5efa\u65e2\u4fdd\u62a4\u513f\u7ae5\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u7b26\u5408\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8981\u6c42\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u513f\u7ae5AI\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks. With a calibrated Chain-of-Thought, TimeOmni-VL is the first to leverage time series understanding as an explicit control signal for high-fidelity generation.

It includes 50+ state-of-the-art algorithms, 40 metrics, and 19 filtering and splitting strategies that seamlessly transition from local execution to distributed training and optimization. The framework enforces ecological responsibility by integrating CodeCarbon for real-time energy tracking, showing that scalability need not come at the cost of scientific integrity or sustainability. Furthermore, WarpRec anticipates the shift toward Agentic AI, leading Recommender Systems to evolve from static ranking engines into interactive tools within the Generative AI ecosystem.

However, ZO optimization has a fundamental tension between accuracy and query efficiency. In this work, we show that ZO optimization can be substantially improved by unifying two complementary principles: (i) a projection-based subspace view that reduces gradient estimation variance by exploiting the intrinsic low-rank structure of model updates, and (ii) Muon-style spectral optimization that applies gradient orthogonalization to extract informative spectral structure from noisy ZO gradients. These findings form a unified framework of subspace gradient orthogonalization, which we instantiate in a new method, ZO-Muon, admitting a natural interpretation as a low-rank Muon optimizer in the ZO setting. Extensive experiments on large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate that ZO-Muon significantly accelerates convergence and achieves a win-win improvement in accuracy and query/runtime efficiency. Notably, compared to the popular MeZO baseline, ZO-Muon requires only 24.7% of the queries to reach the same SST-2 performance for LLM fine-tuning, and improves accuracy by 25.1% on ViT-B fine-tuning on CIFAR-100.", "AI": {"tldr": "ZO-Muon\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u548cMuon\u5149\u8c31\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728LLM\u548cViT\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ec5\u9700MeZO 24.7%\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u91cf\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534725.1%\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u867d\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u6295\u5f71\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u548cMuon\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u63d0\u53d6\u5149\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3aZO-Muon\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLM\u548cViT\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cZO-Muon\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700MeZO 24.7%\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u91cf\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540cSST-2\u6027\u80fd\uff0cViT-B\u5728CIFAR-100\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534725.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ZO\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u7387-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0cZO-Muon\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u67e5\u8be2/\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u8d62\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains.

Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30CoT\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u4e13\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u5fc5\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528LLM\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dCoT\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6216\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f2\u533a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Thinker-Executor\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06CoT\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cfExecutor\u91cd\u7528Thinker\u7684CoT\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\uff09\u4ee5\u53caExecutor\u901a\u8fc7CoT\u5339\u914dThinker\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u9891\u7387\uff08\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u57285\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f304\u4e2aThinker\u6a21\u578b\u548c10\u4e2aExecutor\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65e0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u4e13\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684CoT\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u6bd4Llama\u3001Gemma\u7b49\u901a\u7528LLM\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u6216\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u6392\u884c\u699c\u5b58\u5728\u76f2\u70b9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u6765\u5168\u9762\u8861\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories.

However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \\textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \\textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \\textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \\textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \\textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \\textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \\textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts.

Our empirical findings show that the learned latent space is continuous and interpretable while maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions. Pulse families such as higher-order Gaussians trace coherent trajectories, while standardizing the temporal pulse lengths shows a latent organization correlated with pulse energy. Analysis via principal components and Gaussian Mixture Models reveals a well behaved latent geometry, enabling smooth transitions between distinct pulse types via linear interpolation.

Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \\textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a \"human game\" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the \"Multiverse of Human Games\". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms.

Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the Tur\u00e1n-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four. Here, we present Reinforcement Learning for Graph Theory (RLGT), a novel RL framework that systematizes the previous work and provides support for both undirected and directed graphs, with or without loops, and with an arbitrary number of edge colors.

This sampling scheme has been recently applied in the context of differentially private optimization (Chua et al., 2024a; Choquette-Choo et al., 2025) and communication-efficient high-dimensional private aggregation (Asi et al., 2025), where it was shown to have utility advantages over the standard Poisson sampling. Theoretical analyses of this sampling scheme (Feldman & Shenfeld, 2025; Dong et al., 2025) lead to bounds that are close to those of Poisson sampling, yet still have two significant shortcomings. First, in many practical settings, the resulting privacy parameters are not tight due to the approximation steps in the analysis. Second, the computed parameters are either the hockey stick or Renyi divergence, both of which introduce overheads when used in privacy loss accounting.\n  In this work, we demonstrate that the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm can be computed efficiently. When applied to the Gaussian mechanism, our results demonstrate that the privacy-utility trade-off for random allocation is at least as good as that of Poisson subsampling. In particular, random allocation is better suited for training via DP-SGD. To support these computations, our work develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on a notion of PLD realization. This notion allows us to extend accurate privacy loss accounting to subsampling which previously required manual noise-mechanism-specific analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u5206\u5e03(PLD)\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u7b49\u4e8e\u6cca\u677e\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8eDP-SGD\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8ePLD\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u65b0\u9690\u79c1\u4f1a\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u6790\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a1) \u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9690\u79c1\u53c2\u6570\u56e0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u7d27\uff1b2) \u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u53c9\u5f62/\u96f7\u5c3c\u6563\u5ea6\uff09\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4f1a\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u5efa\u7acb\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u4e0b\u4efb\u610f\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u5206\u5e03(PLD)\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\"PLD\u5b9e\u73b0\"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u7528\u9690\u79c1\u4f1a\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\u673a\u5236\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "1) \u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u81f3\u5c11\u4e0d\u52a3\u4e8e\u6cca\u677e\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2) \u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408DP-SGD\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b3) \u65b0\u4f1a\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6cca\u677e\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u4f1a\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We model this constrained, evolving availability using random graph processes, where arms are nodes and the agent's movement is restricted to its local neighborhood. We analyze this problem under two random graph models: an i.i.d. Erd\u0151s--R\u00e9nyi (ER) process and an Edge-Markovian process. We propose and analyze a two-phase algorithm that employs a lazy random walk for exploration to efficiently identify the optimal arm, followed by a navigation and commitment phase for exploitation. We establish high-probability and expected sublinear regret bounds for both graph settings. We show that the exploration cost of our algorithm is near-optimal by establishing a matching information-theoretic lower bound for this problem class, highlighting the fundamental cost of exploration under local-move constraints.

The model learns robust features that are biologically plausible, interpretable, and strongly associated with established cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and laboratory measures. High VD stratifies individuals for myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality, matching or outperforming conventional risk models such as SCORE2. Explainable AI analyses reveal that the model relies on vessel morphology and perivascular tissue characteristics, uncovering novel functional and anatomical signatures of vascular damage.

We introduce SubQuad, an end-to-end pipeline that addresses these challenges by combining antigen-aware, near-subquadratic retrieval with GPU-accelerated affinity kernels, learned multimodal fusion, and fairness-constrained clustering.

Recent advances in graph OOD detection have focused on test-time training techniques that facilitate OOD detection without accessing potential supervisory information (e.g., training data). However, most of these methods employ a one-pass inference paradigm, which prevents them from progressively correcting erroneous predictions to amplify OOD signals. To this end, we propose a \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{I}mproving \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{O}ut-\\textbf{o}f-\\textbf{D}istribution detector (SIGOOD), which is an unsupervised framework that integrates continuous self-learning with test-time training for effective graph OOD detection. Specifically, SIGOOD generates a prompt to construct a prompt-enhanced graph that amplifies potential OOD signals. To optimize prompts, SIGOOD introduces an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss, which leverages energy variations between the original test graph and the prompt-enhanced graph. By iteratively optimizing the prompt by involving it into the detection model in a self-improving loop, the resulting optimal prompt-enhanced graph is ultimately used for OOD detection.

Using a real-world haematuria cohort comprising 568 patients evaluated for bladder cancer, we benchmark CACTUS against widely used machine learning approaches, including random forests and gradient boosting methods, under controlled levels of randomly introduced missing data. We demonstrate that CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Our results show that feature stability provides information complementary to conventional performance metrics and is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of machine learning models applied to biomedical data.

Code is available at https://github.com/DMML-Geneva/VGB-DM", "summary": "Deep generative models such as flow matching and diffusion models have shown great potential in learning complex distributions and dynamical systems, but often act as black-boxes, neglecting underlying physics. In contrast, physics-based simulation models described by ODEs/PDEs remain interpretable, but may have missing or unknown terms, unable to fully describe real-world observations. We bridge this gap with a novel grey-box method that integrates incomplete physics models directly into generative models. Our approach learns dynamics from observational trajectories alone, without ground-truth physics parameters, in a simulation-free manner that avoids scalability and stability issues of Neural ODEs. The core of our method lies in modelling a structured variational distribution within the flow matching framework, by using two latent encodings: one to model the missing stochasticity and multi-modal velocity, and a second to encode physics parameters as a latent variable with a physics-informed prior.

They are known to severely degrade performance, and the convergence rate under delayed feedback is still unclear, even for bilinear games. This paper derives the rate of linear convergence of Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA), which predicts future rewards with extra optimism, in unconstrained bilinear games. To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\\exp(-\u0398(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\\exp(-\u0398(t/(m^{2}\\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems. In summary, this paper validates that extra optimism is a promising countermeasure against performance degradation caused by feedback delays.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Temporal credit assignment mitigates this issue by transforming sparse feedback into dense supervision signals. However, previous approaches typically depend on learning task-specific value functions for credit assignment, which suffer from poor sample efficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose to leverage pretrained knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to transform sparse rewards into dense training signals (i.e., the advantage function) through retrospective in-context learning (RICL). We further propose an online learning framework, RICOL, which iteratively refines the policy based on the credit assignment results from RICL. We empirically demonstrate that RICL can accurately estimate the advantage function with limited samples and effectively identify critical states in the environment for temporal credit assignment. Extended evaluation on four BabyAI scenarios show that RICOL achieves comparable convergent performance with traditional online RL algorithms with significantly higher sample efficiency.

Stultz"], "title": "Position: Evaluation of ECG Representations Must Be Fixed", "comment": "Project website at https://ecgfix.csail.mit.edu/", "summary": "This position paper argues that current benchmarking practice in 12-lead ECG representation learning must be fixed to ensure progress is reliable and aligned with clinically meaningful objectives. The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks. This motivates the use of a random encoder as a reasonable baseline model.

In this paper, we identify three critical challenges in these methods: (1) inefficient gradient utilization caused by the binary cutoff of hard clipping, (2) insensitive probability mass arising from uniform ratio constraints that ignore the token distribution, and (3) asymmetric signal reliability stemming from the disparate credit assignment ambiguity between positive and negative samples. To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions. MASPO integrates a differentiable soft Gaussian gating to maximize gradient utility, a mass-adaptive limiter to balance exploration across the probability spectrum, and an asymmetric risk controller to align update magnitudes with signal confidence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MASPO serves as a robust, all-in-one RLVR solution, significantly outperforming strong baselines.

However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches. These results indicate that, even under low-rank parameterizations, weight regularization remains an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference.

In this work, we present the first formal analysis of how different normalization strategies, specifically instance-based and global scaling, impact the expressivity of Transformer-based architectures for time series representation learning. We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance.

While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time.

Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets.

While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \\textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations.

Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers.

While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bddAI\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f24\u5bb3\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u539f\u5219\u7684\u4eba\u672c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u56fe\u5f62\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u7c7b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bddAI\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u786e\u4fdd\u6b64\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u907f\u514dAI\u635f\u5bb3\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u8865\u5145\u4eba\u7c7b\u6613\u9519\u4e4b\u5904\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u672c\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f24\u5bb3\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u534f\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLM\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f17\u5305\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u6001\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f24\u5bb3\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u8fdd\u53cd\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u677e\u7d27\u4f1a\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u4e0b\u6e38\u4eba\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u6760\u6746\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u5efa\u6a21\u6216\u9650\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u8f6e\u534f\u4f5c\u671d\u5411\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "MARS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "motivation": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u9760\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u6b21\u4f18", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMARS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8fb9\u754c\uff08\u6a21\u7cca\uff09\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u7cbe\u70bc\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u52a0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u66f2\u7387\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4\u5747\u5300\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u76ca", "conclusion": "MARS\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u7cca\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6539\u5584\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027"}}
