However, signal attenuation,\nmolecular absorption, and severe propagation losses in THz channels pose\nsignificant challenges to reliable quantum state transmission and entanglement\ndistribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dynamic\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless QN architecture that\nleverages adaptive RIS elements capable of switching between active and passive\nmodes based on the incident signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These dynamic RIS\nelements enhance beamforming control over amplitude and phase, enabling robust\nredirection and compensation for THz-specific impairments. We develop a\ndetailed analytical model that incorporates key physical layer phenomena in THz\nquantum links, including path loss, fading, thermal noise, and alignment\nvariations. A secure optimization framework is formulated to jointly determine\nRIS placement and entanglement generation rate (EGR) allocation, while\nsatisfying fidelity, security, and fairness constraints under diverse quality\nof service (QoS) demands.

However, their working principle, based on Coriolis effects,\nhas become increasingly ineffective for addressing modern sensing challenges in\ncomplex scenarios. Fortunately, recent advancements in quantized SAWs offer a\npromising solution: SAWs operating at extremely low pump powers (approximately\nat the single-phonon level) can exhibit substantial quantum coherence, enabling\ninvestigations into the fundamental limits of SAW gyroscopes as constrained by\nthe Heisenberg uncertainty relation. In particular, when multiple SAWs couple\nto a common waveguide at distinct locations, the nonlocality arising from the\nspatial separation among coupling points induces directional coupling between\nthe SAWs. To elucidate this directionality, we propose a quantum gyroscope\ncharacterized by multiplepoint couplings. Unlike traditional single-point\ncoupling designs, our gyroscope exhibits distinctive time-delayed dynamics that\ndepend on the system's topologies. We emphasize that these dynamics invalidate\nthe Markovian approximation, even when the time delay is relatively small.\nThrough a comprehensive analysis of all possible topologies, we observe that\nthe directional coupling implies an inherent nonreciprocal transfer. This\nnonreciprocity confers signiffcant advantages to our gyroscope compared to\ntraditional designs, notably enhancing both the signal-to-noise ratio and\nsensitivity.

While researchers have\nstudied how easy VQAs are to train, the effect of quantum noise on the\nclassical optimisation process is still not well understood. Contrary to\nexpectations, we find that twirling, which is commonly used in standard\nerror-mitigation strategies to symmetrise noise, actually degrades performance\nin the variational setting, whereas preserving biased or non-unital noise can\nhelp classical optimisers find better solutions. Analytically, we study a\nuniversal quantum regression model and demonstrate that relatively uniform\nPauli channels suppress gradient magnitudes and reduce expressivity, making\noptimisation more difficult. Conversely, asymmetric noise such as amplitude\ndamping or biased Pauli channels introduces directional bias that can be\nexploited during optimisation. Numerical experiments on a variational\neigensolver for the transverse-field Ising model confirm that non-unital noise\nyields lower-energy states compared to twirled noise.

A general assumption of\ntraining the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that\nthe errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,\nthis assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by\nboth the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the\nperformance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current\nstudies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally\nAutocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed\nto systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic\nforecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a\nrandom Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a\nspatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic\ndependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error\ncorrelations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly\nformulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is\nintroduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned\ncoefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an\ninference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically\nrefine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time\nforecasting.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a\npromising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to\ncomplex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable\nnature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear\noptimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training\non sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited\nsequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging\nits warm-up period.\n  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient\nslope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in\ndeeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,\nwe find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much\nmore pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead\nto a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we\npropose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to\nbootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment\ninteractions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive\nslope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an\naverage return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,\nincluding Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points\nunder the same conditions.

Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a\nrandom Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a\nspatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic\ndependencies.

Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of\nmissing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications\nwhere the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to\nbe monitored, due to budget constraints.

Causal discovery in time series is\nhindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal\nrelationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A\ncommon approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.\nTraditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of\nthe resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple\nvalid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We\npropose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based\ncausal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS\neffectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic\ngraph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We\nformalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the\nadditive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to\nenable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the\napproach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a\nscalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery.

Guided\nwaves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener\ncomposite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency\nrepresentations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised\nensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using\nfast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved\n81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%\nperformance, outperforming existing baselines."}

Causal discovery in time series is\nhindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal\nrelationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A\ncommon approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.\nTraditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of\nthe resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple\nvalid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We\npropose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based\ncausal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS\neffectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic\ngraph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We\nformalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the\nadditive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to\nenable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the\napproach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a\nscalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic\nbenchmarks ($d{=}\\!3-\\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\\!-\\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS\nimproves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the\nCausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\\!-\\!36$), while baselines remain the\nbest on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph\n$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These\nresults establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal\ndiscovery."}

Deep learning methods have\nrecently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving\npromising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their\nperformance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,\ninefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to\nexploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,\nwe introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation\nmodel for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges\nwith three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale\nsynthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an\nSO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational\nsymmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)\ncontrollable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system\nsupporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual\nunconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art\nperformance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating\naccurate (RMSD < 2 \\r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold\n3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters\nbenchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the\nnext best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers\n$3.6\\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug\ntargets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \\r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in\ntraining."}
