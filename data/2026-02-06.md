### [1] [Active Soft-Impact Oscillator: Dynamics of a Walking Droplet in a Non-Smooth Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05913)
*Titir Mukherjee,Rahil N Valani,Soumitro Banerjee*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: This paper models walking droplets (millimetric fluid drops self-propelling via wave interactions on a vibrated bath) as an "active soft-impact oscillator" to study nonlinear dynamics in non-smooth potentials, revealing diverse behaviors like chaos transitions and attractor switching through theoretical and numerical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a minimal model for walking droplets moving in piecewise-smooth potentials, bridging classical active wave-particle systems (like hydrodynamic quantum analogs) and nonlinear dynamics of soft-impact oscillators, thereby probing universal principles of nonlinear impact dynamics in active matter.

Method: Theoretical and numerical exploration of an active soft-impact oscillator model that couples non-smooth soft-impact forces with Lorenz-like wave-particle dynamics, systematically analyzing the full parameter space to identify bifurcations and nonlinear phenomena.

Result: Discovery of rich nonlinear behaviors including grazing-induced and impact-induced transitions between periodic/chaotic motion, grazing-mediated attractor switching, and impact-free ("invisible") attractor switching, driven by impact and grazing events in the parameter space.

Conclusion: The active soft-impact oscillator serves as a versatile platform for investigating nonlinear impact dynamics in active systems and exploring hydrodynamic quantum analogs in non-smooth potentials, advancing understanding of complex wave-particle interactions beyond idealized models.

Abstract: Walking droplets are millimetric fluid drops that propel themselves across a vibrated liquid bath through interaction with their self-generated waves. They constitute classical active wave-particle entities and exhibit a range of hydrodynamic quantum analogs. We investigate an \emph{active soft-impact oscillator} as a minimal model for a walking droplet moving within a piecewise-smooth external potential, analogous to classical mass-spring soft-impact oscillators and recently explored quantum soft-impact oscillators. Our active soft-impact oscillator model couples a non-smooth soft-impact force to the Lorenz-like dynamics arising from the wave-particle entity. Theoretical and numerical exploration of the full parameter space reveals a wide variety of nonlinear behaviors and bifurcations driven by impact and grazing events. These include grazing-induced and impact-induced transitions between periodic and chaotic motion, as well as grazing-mediated attractor switching and impact-free (invisible) attractor switching. The active soft-impact oscillator thus provides a versatile platform for probing nonlinear impact dynamics in active systems and exploring hydrodynamic quantum analogs in non-smooth potentials.

### [2] [Artificial Intelligence as Strange Intelligence: Against Linear Models of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04986)
*Kendra Chilson,Eric Schwitzgebel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文批判AI进步的线性模型，提出"奇异智能"概念，认为AI能力呈现非线性特征——在部分领域超人类，其他领域却低于人类水平，甚至在同一领域内同时展现超凡洞察力与反直觉错误。作者构建非线性智能模型，主张"通用智能"并非单一能力，而是广泛环境中实现多样目标的能力，不能被简化为线性量度。这对对抗性测试提出新要求：顶尖AI在某些任务上的失败并不证明其缺乏通用智能，而单一任务（如智商测试）的优秀表现也不能外推至其他领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性模型假设智能可沿单一维度量化，但实际AI系统能力分布极不均匀——超级能力与严重缺陷并存，这种模式无法用传统"智能高低"的线性标度解释。现有评估方法因此可能产生误导，需要新的理论框架理解AI的真实能力结构。

Method: 通过理论分析与概念建构展开：1) 继承并扩展Schneider对线性模型的批判；2) 创新性地提出"熟悉智能"与"奇异智能"这对概念，区分人类式与AI式智能模式；3) 论证并捍卫非线性智能模型，将通用智能重新定义为"在广泛环境中实现多样目标的能力"，强调其不可被简化为单一量值的特性；4) 推导该理论对对抗性测试的方法论启示。

Result: 建立了AI作为"奇异智能"的理论框架，其特征是能力分布的非连续性与不可预测性。非线性模型成功解构了"通用智能"作为统一实体的迷思，揭示智能的多维性与环境依赖性。研究得出：AI的意外失败是其能力模式的内在特征而非缺陷，对抗性测试应接受"顶尖系统也会在简单任务上失误"的可能性，同时警惕从狭窄任务表现过度泛化。

Conclusion: AI评估必须放弃线性思维，接受智能的非线性本质。这意味着：1) 失败是预测之中的，不能仅凭失败否定系统的整体智能水平；2) 成功是局部的，不能从单一任务表现推断广泛能力。对抗性测试应设计更全面、跨领域的能力探测，而非依赖线性外推的评估逻辑。

Abstract: We endorse and expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce two novel concepts: "familiar intelligence" and "strange intelligence". AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which "general intelligence" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.

### [3] [MINT: Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree for Objective-Driven Knowledge-Gap Reasoning and Active Elicitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05048)
*Zeyu Fang,Tian Lan,Mahdi Imani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MINT框架，通过神经符号树推理知识缺口并优化AI主动提问策略，实现开放世界规划中人类-AI高效协作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界规划中存在对象、目标等信息缺失导致的知识缺口，需AI主动通过语言交互获取人类输入以提升协作规划效果

Method: 1) 构建符号树枚举可能的交互命题；2) 利用神经规划策略估计知识缺口引发的规划不确定性；3) 结合LLM搜索优化MINT推理过程并生成最优提问策略；4) 通过自博弈训练强化AI主动 elicitation 能力

Result: 在三个未知对象复杂度递增的基准测试中，MINT仅需每任务少量提问即达到接近专家水平的回报，显著提升奖励值与任务成功率

Conclusion: 该框架通过量化知识缺口影响并优化主动提问策略，有效解决了开放世界规划中的信息缺失问题，为人类-AI高效协作提供了可证明的理论保证和实践方案

Abstract: Joint planning through language-based interactions is a key area of human-AI teaming. Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.

### [4] [Evaluating Large Language Models on Solved and Unsolved Problems in Graph Theory: Implications for Computing Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05059)
*Adithya Kulkarni,Mohna Chakraborty,Jay Bagga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过八阶段数学探究协议，评估LLM在图论问题上的表现，发现其在已知问题上能构建有效证明，但在未解问题上缺乏突破性洞见，建议教育中应将其用于概念探索而非严格证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型越来越多地被学生用于探索计算机科学中的高级内容（包括图论），并将其整合到课程作业中，了解它们如何可靠地支持数学严谨性思维变得至关重要。

Method: 研究通过八个阶段的评估协议来检验LLM在两个相关问题上的表现：一个是关于线图优美性的已解决问题，另一个是尚无解法的未解问题。该协议包括解释、探索、策略制定和证明构建等真实数学探究要素。

Result: 在已解决问题上，模型表现良好：产生正确定义、识别相关结构、准确回忆结果且无幻觉，构建了经专家确认的有效证明。在未解问题上，模型虽产生连贯的解释和合理的探索策略，但未能推进解决方案，仅承认不确定性而未虚构结果。

Conclusion: LLM能支持既定材料的探索，但在需要新颖数学洞察力或关键结构推理的任务中仍有限制。计算教育中应引导学生将LLM用于概念探索，而对正式问题解决则依赖独立验证和严谨论证。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.
  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.
  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.

### [5] [Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05073)
*Changdae Oh,Seongheon Park,To Eun Kim,Jiatong Li,Wendi Li,Samuel Yeh,Xuefeng Du,Hamed Hassani,Paul Bogdan,Dawn Song,Sharon Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that uncertainty quantification (UQ) for LLMs must shift from single-turn QA to interactive agents. It proposes a novel conditional uncertainty reduction framework that models reducible uncertainty over agent trajectories, providing actionable guidance for designing agent UQ beyond previous accumulation-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM UQ research focuses on single-turn question-answering, failing to address the complexity of interactive agents deployed in open-world settings. A new principled framework for agent UQ is needed to build safety guardrails for real-world LLM applications.

Method: Presents a general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes existing setups, and introduces a conditional uncertainty reduction perspective that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by emphasizing action interactivity, rather than treating uncertainty as merely accumulative.

Result: Outlines a conceptual framework providing actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups, addressing limitations of prior accumulation-based approaches that break down in interactive, open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Discusses practical implications for frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, while highlighting open problems that remain in agent UQ research, emphasizing the need for further work in this emerging area.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is a key building block for safety guardrails of daily LLM applications. Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting "interactivity" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.

### [6] [Optimizing Mission Planning for Multi-Debris Rendezvous Using Reinforcement Learning with Refueling and Adaptive Collision Avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05075)
*Agni Bandyopadhyay,Gunther Waxenegger-Wilfing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework using masked PPO is proposed for multi-debris active debris removal missions with small satellites, integrating refueling and collision avoidance to improve safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The orbital environment is increasingly crowded with debris, making active debris removal missions challenging for ensuring safe operations and minimizing collision risks. Small satellites are suitable for these dynamic missions due to their flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and maneuverability.

Method: A masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning algorithm is employed to create a framework that integrates refueling strategies, mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance for multi-debris rendezvous operations.

Result: The RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches, as demonstrated through simulations using the Iridium 33 debris dataset covering diverse orbital configurations.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.

Abstract: As the orbital environment around Earth becomes increasingly crowded with debris, active debris removal (ADR) missions face significant challenges in ensuring safe operations while minimizing the risk of in-orbit collisions. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.
  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.
  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.
  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.

### [7] [Evaluating Robustness and Adaptability in Learning-Based Mission Planning for Active Debris Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05091)
*Agni Bandyopadhyay,Günther Waxenegger-Wilfing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 主动碎片清除(ADR)的自主任务规划需平衡效率、适应性与严格的燃料和时长约束。本研究对比了低地球轨道多碎片交会问题的三种规划器：固定参数训练的掩码PPO策略、域随机化掩码PPO策略以及蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)基线，揭示了在在线重规划与预训练策略之间的速度-适应性权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动碎片清除任务要求在多约束条件下实现高效、可靠的多目标交会，而传统方法在遭遇分布偏移时性能急剧下降，亟需开发能在不确定任务参数下保持鲁棒性的自适应规划算法。

Method: 在包含加油、真实轨道动力学和随机碎片场的高保真仿真环境中，对三种规划器进行300个测试案例的评估，涵盖正常、燃料减少和任务时间缩短三种场景。

Result: 域随机化PPO在保持可接受名义性能的同时显著提升了适应性；MCTS因在线重规划最能应对约束变化，但计算时间高出数个量级；名义PPO仅在训练条件匹配时表现最佳，遇分布偏移则性能骤降。

Conclusion: 学习策略的速度与搜索方法的适应性存在根本权衡，未来有希望通过结合训练时的约束多样性增强与在线重规划能力，构建更具韧性的ADR任务规划器。

Abstract: Autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR) must balance efficiency, adaptability, and strict feasibility constraints on fuel and mission duration. This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.

### [8] [Understanding LLM Evaluator Behavior: A Structured Multi-Evaluator Framework for Merchant Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05110)
*Liang Wang,Junpeng Wang,Chin-chia Michael Yeh,Yan Zheng,Jiarui Sun,Xiran Fan,Xin Dai,Yujie Fan,Yiwei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-evaluator framework assessing LLM reasoning in payment risk shows significant bias variation among models, with anonymization reducing bias by 25.8% and some models aligning better with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the reliability and bias of LLMs as evaluators in payments-risk settings, particularly for MCC-based merchant risk assessment, which has been poorly studied despite increasing LLM adoption.

Method: Developed a structured multi-evaluator framework using a five-criterion rubric and Monte-Carlo scoring. Five frontier LLMs generated and cross-evaluated MCC risk rationales under both attributed and anonymized conditions. A consensus-deviation metric was introduced to create judge-independent references by comparing each model's scores to the mean of all other judges.

Result: Substantial heterogeneity in LLM evaluation biases: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet showed negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 showed positive bias (+0.77, +0.71). Anonymization reduced bias by 25.8%. LLMs scored +0.46 points above human expert consensus. Models with negative bias aligned more closely with human judgment. Four models showed significant alignment with ground-truth data (Spearman rho = 0.56-0.77).

Conclusion: The framework provides a replicable method for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows, demonstrating the critical need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators of reasoning quality, yet their reliability and bias in payments-risk settings remain poorly understood. We introduce a structured multi-evaluator framework for assessing LLM reasoning in Merchant Category Code (MCC)-based merchant risk assessment, combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality. Overall, the framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.

### [9] [Democratic Preference Alignment via Sortition-Weighted RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05113)
*Suvadip Sana,Jinzhou Wu,Martin T. Wells*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Democratic Preference Optimization (DemPO), a framework using algorithmic sortition to ensure demographic representativeness in AI preference learning. It proposes two schemes: Hard Panel (training only on representative samples) and Soft Panel (reweighting all raters by inclusion probability). Evaluations on Llama models show both methods improve alignment with representative public values, with Hard Panel performing best and effect sizes increasing with model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference-based alignment methods like RLHF rely on human raters, but these are typically convenience samples that systematically misrepresent demographics. This raises the critical question: whose values should AI systems learn? Current approaches lack democratic legitimacy and may amplify biases from unrepresentative rater pools.

Method: DemPO applies algorithmic sortition (used in citizen assemblies) to preference fine-tuning. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a demographically representative mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their sortition inclusion probability. Theoretically, Soft Panel's weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form.

Result: Using a public preference dataset with rater demographics and a 75-clause US constitution from a representative panel, experiments on Llama models (1B-8B parameters) show: (1) Hard Panel consistently ranks first across six aggregation methods; (2) Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline; (3) Effect sizes grow as model capacity increases.

Conclusion: Enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage (via sortition) rather than post-hoc correction yields AI models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics. This approach provides a principled, democratic foundation for AI alignment.

Abstract: Whose values should AI systems learn? Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.

TL;DR: CAST-CKT是一个面向数据稀缺跨城市交通预测的混沌感知框架。它通过混沌分析量化可预测性状态，自适应调整时空建模和跨城市知识迁移，在MAE和RMSE指标上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨城市交通预测方法难以应对数据稀缺问题，因为复杂非线性动力学和领域偏移使其无法捕捉交通流的混沌本质，导致小样本学习效果不佳。

Method: 提出CAST-CKT框架：1) 高效混沌分析器量化交通流可预测性状态；2) 基于混沌感知的注意力机制实现状态自适应时序建模；3) 自适应拓扑学习捕获动态空间依赖；4) 混沌一致性跨城市对齐实现知识迁移；5) 提供具有不确定性量化的时域特定预测。

Result: 在四个跨城市小样本基准测试上，CAST-CKT在MAE和RMSE指标上显著优于最先进方法，并提供可解释的混沌状态分析。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将混沌理论引入交通预测，理论分析证明其泛化界提升，为数据稀缺的跨城市场景提供了性能优越且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts. Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

TL;DR: 提出HugRAG框架，通过分层模块的因果门控机制解决现有图增强生成方法中表面匹配、缺乏因果建模和信息孤岛问题，实现可扩展的因果推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基RAG方法过度依赖表面级节点匹配且缺乏显式因果建模，导致答案不忠实或虚假；先前因果尝试局限于局部或单文档上下文，模块化图结构导致信息孤岛，阻碍可扩展性和跨模块因果推理

Method: 设计HugRAG框架，采用分层模块间的因果门控机制，显式建模因果关系以抑制虚假相关性，支持大规模知识图上的可扩展推理

Result: 在多个数据集和评估指标上，HugRAG持续优于现有图基RAG基线方法

Conclusion: 为结构化、可扩展且因果 grounded 的RAG系统建立了原则性基础

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models by enabling access to external knowledge, with graph-based RAG emerging as a powerful paradigm for structured retrieval and reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

### [13] [Traceable Cross-Source RAG for Chinese Tibetan Medicine Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05195)
*Fengxian Chen,Zhilong Tao,Jiaxuan Li,Yunlong Li,Qingguo Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses multi-KB RAG challenges in Chinese Tibetan medicine where dense encyclopedia entries dominate retrieval. It proposes DAKS for intelligent KB routing and an alignment graph for evidence fusion, improving cross-KB verification and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG promises grounded question answering but struggles with heterogeneous knowledge bases. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, dense encyclopedia entries dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence, causing potential inaccuracies and hallucinations.

Method: Studies three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, clinical papers) with a 500-query benchmark. Proposes DAKS for KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density bias, plus an alignment graph for evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing. Uses lightweight openPangu-Embedded-7B generator.

Result: Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage. The full system achieves best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses multi-KB RAG challenges in specialized domains, successfully mitigating bias toward dense sources and enabling better cross-KB verification for more reliable, traceable question answering.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) promises grounded question answering, yet domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (KBs) remain challenging. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Surgery的防御方法，利用注意力汇聚机制的"汇聚散度"统计量来缓解大语言模型的有害微调问题，通过正则化将注意力头引导至负汇聚散度组，从而降低模型学习有害模式的倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有害微调会破坏大语言模型的安全对齐，导致显著的安全风险，需要新的防御机制来保护模型在微调阶段的安全性。

Method: 提出可分离汇聚散度假设，并开发Surgery防御方法，通过测量各注意力头的汇聚散度，使用正则化抑制正汇聚散度，使注意力头转向负汇聚散度组，从而减少有害模式学习。

Result: 在BeaverTails、HarmBench和SorryBench基准测试上，Surgery分别提升了5.90%、11.25%和9.55%的防御性能。

Conclusion: 注意力汇聚机制能有效缓解有害微调问题，Surgery提供了一种在微调阶段有效防御有害内容学习的可行方法。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models for brain tumour detection. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed and trained on the BraTS 2021 dataset, achieving 91.24% accuracy in distinguishing between tumour and non-tumour regions. This research combines Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into the model's decision-making process. This multi-technique approach successfully identified both full and partial tumours, offering layered explanations ranging from broad regions of interest to pixel-level details. GRAD-CAM highlighted important spatial regions, LRP provided detailed pixel-level relevance and SHAP quantified feature contributions. The integrated approach effectively explained model predictions, including cases with partial tumour visibility thus showing superior explanatory power compared to individual XAI methods. This research enhances transparency and trust in AI-driven medical imaging analysis by offering a more comprehensive perspective on the model's reasoning. The study demonstrates the potential of integrated XAI techniques in improving the reliability and interpretability of AI systems in healthcare, particularly for critical tasks like brain tumour detection.

TL;DR: 针对家庭智能体在未见3D环境中的评估问题，本文提出TEA动态原位任务生成方法，通过交互-进化两阶段系统在10个场景中自动生成87,876个任务，揭示当前SOTA模型在基础感知、3D交互和任务推理方面的严重不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用智能体即将在多样化家庭环境中部署，但现有基准测试存在数据污染和场景特异性不足的问题，无法有效评估智能体在未见环境中的真实能力。

Method: 提出TEA动态原位任务生成方法，采用结构化图表示定义任务，构建交互-进化两阶段系统：交互阶段通过智能体与环境互动形成任务执行与生成的闭环；进化阶段通过任务图模型重组复用现有任务，无需外部数据即可生成新任务。

Result: 在10个未见场景中，TEA在两次循环中自动生成87,876个任务，人类验证确认这些任务物理合理且涵盖核心日常认知能力。基准测试显示，SOTA模型在基础感知任务上表现远逊于人类，严重缺乏3D交互意识，且在推理任务上对任务类型高度敏感。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了在将智能体部署到真实人类环境之前进行原位评估的必要性，现有模型在基础感知和交互能力方面仍有重大缺陷。

Abstract: As general intelligent agents are poised for widespread deployment in diverse households, evaluation tailored to each unique unseen 3D environment has become a critical prerequisite. However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning. These sobering findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments.

TL;DR: 提出recos相似度度量，通过改进点积上界并归一化排序向量，突破余弦相似度的线性限制，在11个嵌入模型上均显著优于余弦相似度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 余弦相似度基于柯西-施瓦茨不等式，仅能捕获线性关系，无法建模真实语义空间中的复杂非线性结构，限制了其表达能力。

Method: 推导出比经典柯西-施瓦茨更紧的点积上界，提出recos度量：通过排序后的向量分量归一化点积，将完美相似条件从严格线性依赖放宽至序数一致性，以捕获更广泛的关系类型。

Result: 在11个涵盖静态、上下文化和通用类型的嵌入模型上，recos在标准语义文本相似度基准测试中始终优于余弦相似度，与人类判断的相关性更高。

Conclusion: recos是一个数学原理严谨且经验证更优的替代方案，为复杂嵌入空间中的语义分析提供了更高的准确性和更丰富的相似性建模能力。

Abstract: Cosine similarity, the standard metric for measuring semantic similarity in vector spaces, is mathematically grounded in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which inherently limits it to capturing linear relationships--a constraint that fails to model the complex, nonlinear structures of real-world semantic spaces. We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks. Our work establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.

*Kim Hammar,Tansu Alpcan,Emil Lupu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework that uses LLMs iteratively with consistency checks and external feedback to reduce hallucinations in security incident response, cutting recovery times by 30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models show promise for security management tasks like incident response planning, but their unreliability and hallucination tendencies pose significant challenges that need to be addressed.

Method: Introduces an iterative framework where an LLM generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, the system abstains and collects external feedback (e.g., from digital twin evaluation), which is used to refine actions via in-context learning. The paper provides theoretical analysis proving hallucination risk can be controlled through threshold tuning and establishes regret bounds for ICL.

Result: Applied to incident response planning using system logs, experiments across four public datasets demonstrate up to 30% reduction in recovery times compared to frontier LLMs.

Conclusion: The principled framework effectively mitigates LLM hallucination risks in security management, offering both theoretical guarantees and significant practical improvements in incident response efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文认为追求"时间序列通用基础模型"存在根本性范畴错误，误将结构性容器当作语义模态。通过提出"自回归盲界"理论极限，论证单体模型在分布漂移下的局限性，倡导采用因果控制智能体范式，并呼吁将评估基准从零样本准确率转向漂移适应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列建模领域存在将"通用基础模型"作为目标的趋势，但作者认为这犯了范畴错误：时间序列是结构性容器而非语义模态。不同领域的生成过程（如金融vs流体力学）本质不兼容，导致单体模型在分布漂移时性能退化。

Method: 1）理论层面：提出"自回归盲界"，证明仅依赖历史数据的模型无法预测干预驱动的体制转换；2）范式层面：倡导因果控制智能体范式，利用外部上下文协调专用求解器层次结构（冻结领域专家+轻量级即时适配器）。

Result: 建立了自回归盲界的理论极限，从数学上证明了纯历史数据模型在应对干预驱动的系统性变化时的根本缺陷。

Conclusion: 呼吁学术界将评估基准从零样本准确率转向漂移适应速度，推动构建基于控制论的鲁棒系统，摒弃对通用模型的追求。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the pursuit of "Universal Foundation Models for Time Series" rests on a fundamental category error, mistaking a structural Container for a semantic Modality. We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive "Generic Filters" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the "Autoregressive Blindness Bound," a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors. We conclude by calling for a shift in benchmarks from "Zero-Shot Accuracy" to "Drift Adaptation Speed" to prioritize robust, control-theoretic systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PieArena, a negotiation benchmark based on MBA courses, finding that GPT-5 matches or exceeds trained business students in negotiation tasks, while revealing multi-dimensional behavioral differences across LLMs and persistent trustworthiness issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negotiation is a central business task requiring strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation, yet LLM capabilities in this domain remain underexplored.

Method: The authors create PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark using realistic scenarios from an elite MBA negotiation course, conducting multi-agent interactions to evaluate LLMs against trained business-school students.

Result: GPT-5 demonstrates AGI-level performance matching or outperforming coached students; joint-intentionality scaffolding yields asymmetric gains (larger for weaker models); multi-dimensional profiles reveal cross-model heterogeneity in deception, computation, compliance, and reputation.

Conclusion: Frontier language agents show intellectual and psychological readiness for high-stakes economic deployment, but robustness and trustworthiness deficiencies remain significant challenges.

Abstract: We present an in-depth evaluation of LLMs' ability to negotiate, a central business task that requires strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation. To do so, we introduce PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark grounded in multi-agent interactions over realistic scenarios drawn from an MBA negotiation course at an elite business school. We find systematic evidence of AGI-level performance in which a representative frontier agent (GPT-5) matches or outperforms trained business-school students, despite a semester of general negotiation instruction and targeted coaching immediately prior to the task. We further study the effects of joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding and find asymmetric gains, with large improvements for mid- and lower-tier LMs and diminishing returns for frontier LMs. Beyond deal outcomes, PieArena provides a multi-dimensional negotiation behavioral profile, revealing novel cross-model heterogeneity, masked by deal-outcome-only benchmarks, in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation. Overall, our results suggest that frontier language agents are already intellectually and psychologically capable of deployment in high-stakes economic settings, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes with opaque internal workflows, making them difficult to interpret and control despite LLMs' strong problem-solving capabilities.

Method: Introduces Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR) task and AgentXRay, a search-based framework using Monte Carlo Tree Search with Red-Black Pruning to synthesize explicit workflows from input-output access only.

Result: AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets across diverse domains.

Conclusion: The framework successfully produces editable white-box workflows that approximate black-box systems without accessing model parameters, improving interpretability and control.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown strong capabilities in complex problem solving, yet many agentic systems remain difficult to interpret and control due to opaque internal workflows. While some frameworks offer explicit architectures for collaboration, many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes to users. We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets.

TL;DR: 针对大语言模型极量化部署中残差二值化存在的路径间适应问题，本文提出RaBiT框架，通过算法性强制残差层级结构，从单精度权重顺序推导二值路径，实现各路径对前序路径误差的逐层校正，在RTX 4090上取得4.49倍加速并达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的极量化部署需要在低比特效率与性能间权衡。残差二值化虽能实现硬件友好的无矩阵乘法推理，但存在病态特征共适应问题，特别是路径间适应导致并行残差路径学习冗余特征，破坏误差补偿结构并限制模型表达能力。

Method: 提出RaBiT量化框架，通过算法强制建立残差层级：从共享的FP权重顺序推导每个二值路径，确保每条路径校正前序路径的误差；并采用强调功能保持的鲁棒初始化策略来稳定训练过程。

Result: 重新定义了2比特精度-效率前沿，达到SOTA性能，可媲美硬件密集型矢量量化方法，在RTX 4090上相比全精度模型实现4.49倍推理加速。

Conclusion: RaBiT通过算法性解决特征共适应问题，在极低比特（2-bit）条件下实现了高性能推理，为大语言模型的部署提供了新的最优方案。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires extreme quantization, forcing a critical trade-off between low-bit efficiency and performance. Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

Abstract: Domain specific large language models are increasingly used to support patient education, triage, and clinical decision making in ophthalmology, making rigorous evaluation essential to ensure safety and accuracy. This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.

TL;DR: A novel physics-informed neural framework (OPINN) using Diffusion-Convection-Reaction dynamics achieves state-of-the-art opinion evolution forecasting, addressing limitations of existing PINN methods in social behavior modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Opinion dynamics modeling is crucial for mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. Existing PINN-based methods suffer from incomplete priors, lack comprehensive multi-level (local/global/endogenous) physical dynamics integration, and use penalty-based constraints that poorly encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and transparency issues between latent representations and physical principles.

Method: Proposes a Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory to interpret opinion dynamics. Building upon Neural ODEs, the OPINN framework coordinates neural networks with physical priors to create a more physically transparent and interpretable model for opinion dynamics.

Result: OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting when evaluated on both real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: OPINN offers a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems, providing a more physically transparent and interpretable approach to opinion dynamics modeling that better synergizes mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility.

Abstract: Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.

Abstract: Hospital administration departments handle a wide range of operational tasks and, in large hospitals, process over 10,000 requests per day, driving growing interest in LLM-based automation. However, prior work has focused primarily on patient--physician interactions or isolated administrative subtasks, failing to capture the complexity of real administrative workflows. To address this gap, we propose H-AdminSim, a comprehensive end-to-end simulation framework that combines realistic data generation with multi-agent-based simulation of hospital administrative workflows. These tasks are quantitatively evaluated using detailed rubrics, enabling systematic comparison of LLMs. Through FHIR integration, H-AdminSim provides a unified and interoperable environment for testing administrative workflows across heterogeneous hospital settings, serving as a standardized testbed for assessing the feasibility and performance of LLM-driven administrative automation.

Conclusion: 研究结果为提升波动电力市场的预测准确性和决策制定提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e.g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出OD-CRL框架，通过自适应正交基优化和零空间去噪投影解决条件表征学习中基敏感性和子空间干扰问题，在多任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件表征学习方法依赖LLM生成的文本基来投影通用特征，但存在对子空间基敏感和易受子空间间干扰两个关键限制，影响模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出OD-CRL框架，包含两个核心组件：1) AOBO通过奇异值分解和基于曲率的截断构建正交语义基；2) NSDP通过将嵌入投影到无关子空间的零空间来抑制非目标语义干扰。

Result: 在定制聚类、分类和检索任务上的广泛实验表明，OD-CRL实现了新的最先进性能，并展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: OD-CRL框架有效解决了条件表征学习的基敏感性和子空间干扰问题，为定制化任务提供了更鲁棒的特征提取方法。

Abstract: Conditional representation learning aims to extract criterion-specific features for customized tasks. Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ALIVE框架解决LLM的奖励瓶颈问题，通过认知协同统一问题生成、求解和评判，利用对抗学习和指导式语言反馈内化评估标准，实现无监督的自我推理能力提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习的标量奖励存在三大缺陷：成本高昂、跨领域脆弱、无法捕捉解题逻辑，导致模型难以建立深度推理理解，形成奖励瓶颈

Method: 基于认知协同原则，将问题提出、求解和评判统一到单一策略模型中，通过对抗学习与指导式语言反馈相结合，使模型直接从原始语料内化评估标准，将外部批评转化为内在推理能力

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和逻辑推断基准测试中，ALIVE用相同数据和算力实现准确率提升、跨领域泛化能力显著增强、自我修正率提高，有效缓解了奖励信号局限性

Conclusion: 推理三位一体催生了自我维持的能力增长轨迹，ALIVE为通用推理对齐提供了可扩展的基础，无需人工监督即可实现专家级推理能力

Abstract: The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \textbf{costly} to scale, \textbf{brittle} across domains, and \textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \textbf{ALIVE} (\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.

Abstract: Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SDFP is a training-free framework that creates lightweight draft models for speculative decoding by pruning low-impact layers using Fisher Information Trace, achieving 1.32x-1.5x speedup without altering output distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have high latency in interactive multimedia applications; speculative decoding is limited by costly draft model acquisition/maintenance, and existing methods require training or expensive optimization.

Method: SDFP uses FIT-based layer pruning of an existing LLM, removing low-impact layers based on layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, creating a compact draft compatible with the original model for standard speculative verification.

Result: Achieves 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup across benchmarks without altering the target model's output distribution, requiring no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts.

Conclusion: SDFP provides a deployment-friendly, training-free method for rapid draft model construction that preserves output quality while significantly reducing LLM decoding latency for multimedia applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin interactive multimedia applications such as captioning, retrieval, recommendation, and creative content generation, yet their autoregressive decoding incurs substantial latency. Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化诊疗决策提供了可靠的数据基础和灵活的多模态AI框架，推动了患者特异性决策支持的发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology require structured, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent. Benchmarked against resources like MultiCaRe, this work advances patient-specific decision support by providing both a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework.

### [32] [Split Personality Training: Revealing Latent Knowledge Through Alternate Personalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05532)
*Florian Dietz,William Wale,Oscar Gilg,Robert McCarthy,Felix Michalak,Gustavo Ewbank Rodrigues Danon,Miguelito de Guzman,Dietrich Klakow*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Split Personality Training (SPT), a technique that fine-tunes an "honest persona" into an LLM via LoRA adapters to detect concealed misalignment. This honest reviewer accesses the model's latent states after normal responses, achieving 96% detection accuracy on a benchmark where models hide reward hacking behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models can learn to conceal misbehavior during training, making misalignment detection extremely difficult. Standard auditing methods fail because black-box approaches cannot distinguish malicious outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability techniques do not scale effectively with increasing model capabilities.

Method: Split Personality Training (SPT): The approach fine-tunes a second "honest persona" into the model using LoRA parameters that remain dormant during standard operation. After the main model generates a response, the LoRA adapter is activated with a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the output while accessing the model's internal latent states.

Result: On the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism benchmark (where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while hiding this behavior), SPT achieves 96% overall detection accuracy, dramatically outperforming Anthropic's reported near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals internal knowledge about fictional biases that are invisible to external observers.

Conclusion: SPT successfully detects concealed misalignment by creating an internal honest reviewer persona that can access and evaluate latent representations, effectively bypassing the model's ability to hide misbehavior from external audits.

Abstract: Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training. Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states. We test our method on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism, a benchmark where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while concealing this behavior. SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy, whereas Anthropic reports near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as the fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间推理任务（如七巧板）中存在系统性缺陷（IoU仅0.23-0.41），远低于人类儿童水平，需探索无需参数更新的测试时自优化方法

Method: 设计训练-free的验证-优化智能体，结合上下文学习(ICL)与几何一致性奖励引导的递归反馈循环，模拟人类试错-观察-修正的认知过程

Conclusion: 通过人类启发的迭代优化机制，首次将自优化AI从理论承诺转化为连续空间领域的实践，为视觉语言模型的几何推理提供新范式

Abstract: Humans excel at spatial reasoning tasks like Tangram puzzle assembly through cognitive processes involving mental rotation, iterative refinement, and visual feedback. Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

Result: LLM精准复现了人类在简单/复杂对话中的稳健偏差；不同模型对人类行为的对齐程度存在显著差异

Conclusion: LLM具备在交互环境中模拟人类认知偏差的潜力，但模型差异性提示需针对性设计评估框架，为开发情境感知的偏差感知型AI系统提供关键依据

Abstract: Cognitive biases often shape human decisions. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to reproduce well-known biases, a more critical question is whether LLMs can predict biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors, such as cognitive load, interact with these biases. We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5. The LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. We found notable differences between models in how they aligned human behavior. This has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.

Conclusion: 反应式概率推理框架通过异步处理和选择性重计算，有效解决了动态环境下的实时信念更新难题，为自主系统在复杂环境中的高效决策提供了新范式

Abstract: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.

Result: 实现GameGrammar系统，可从主题提示（如"洞穴中生物发光真菌的竞争"）生成结构完整、可玩的桌游设计，包含机制、组件、胜利条件等，既满足本体约束又具真实创意。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于任何具备专业词汇、约束规则和实例库的领域（音乐、软件架构、烹饪等）。论证约束赋能而非限制创造力，本体使结构化生成成为可能，如语法使诗歌成为可能。

Abstract: Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.
  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional "anxiety" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.
  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt ("bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.
  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology. We argue that constraints do not limit creativity but enable it: just as grammar makes poetry possible, ontology makes structured generation possible.

Abstract: Memory emerges as the core module in the Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents for long-horizon complex tasks (e.g., multi-turn dialogue, game playing, scientific discovery), where memory can enable knowledge accumulation, iterative reasoning and self-evolution. Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems. All the related resources, including research papers, open-source data, and projects, are collected for the community in https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/Awesome-GraphMemory.

Motivation: 现有研究通常用输入输出序列长度的线性函数估算LLM能耗，但实际观测发现存在明显能效区间：短至中等输入配合中等输出时能效最高，过长输入或过短输出时能效急剧下降，表明非线性依赖关系，需更精确的能耗模型。

Method: 基于Transformer架构的计算复杂度和内存访问复杂度，构建了解析模型来表征能效曲线与输入输出长度的函数关系；使用TensorRT-LLM在NVIDIA H100 GPU上测试6类1B-9B参数模型（OPT/LLaMA/Gemma等），覆盖64-4096 token的序列长度范围验证模型准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.

Result: Attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, demonstrating superior fine-tuning performance across multiple datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: GenLoRA achieves higher parameter efficiency than standard LoRA by replacing explicit basis vectors with nonlinear generation, enabling better performance with limited parameters.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approximates the update of a pretrained weight matrix using the product of two low-rank matrices. However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

TL;DR: 该论文指出RLVR中存在递归空间坍缩(RSC)问题，KL正则化会因形状匹配约束导致梯度冲突。为此提出锚定策略优化(APO)，通过支持覆盖和弹性恢复机制突破准确率-多样性权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可验证奖励的强化学习中，现有方法存在系统性病理问题：递归空间坍缩(RSC)导致有效选项的采样概率不可逆地消失。传统KL正则化采用刚性形状匹配约束，与正确性所需的锐化过程产生梯度冲突，造成准确率与多样性的根本性权衡。

Method: 提出锚定策略优化(APO)，将范式从全局形状匹配转向支持覆盖。基于参考模型的高置信度支持定义安全流形，允许策略进行激进的锐化以提升效率，同时在错误修正期间选择性地施加重构力以防止坍缩。理论证明APO是梯度对齐的机制，可实现弹性恢复以重新激活有效分支。

Result: 在数学基准测试中，APO显著提升Pass@1准确率，同时恢复了标准策略梯度方法通常会丧失的Pass@K多样性，成功打破了准确率-多样性的传统权衡。

Conclusion: APO通过支持覆盖而非形状匹配的创新框架，有效解决了RLVR中的递归空间坍缩问题，实现了准确率与多样性的协同提升，为可验证奖励强化学习提供了更优的优化范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is increasingly viewed as a tree pruning mechanism. However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.

TL;DR: 针对金融RAG系统中的幻觉问题，提出RLFKV强化学习框架，通过细粒度知识验证分解响应为原子单元计算可信奖励，并加入信息量奖励防止过度简洁，在金融数据集上验证有效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融RAG系统中，尽管使用检索文档来填补知识空白，模型生成的响应仍存在与检索信息相矛盾的幻觉现象，导致不一致性问题

Method: 提出强化学习框架RLFKV，将金融响应分解为原子知识单元，评估每个单元的正确性以计算细粒度可信奖励；为防止奖励攻击（如过度简洁回答），加入信息量奖励激励策略模型至少保留与基础模型相同数量的知识单元

Result: 在公开的金融数据描述(FDD)任务和新建FDD-ANT数据集上的实验显示持续改进，证实了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: RLFKV框架通过细粒度知识验证和双重奖励机制，有效减轻幻觉并提升与检索文档的对齐效果

Abstract: In financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, models frequently rely on retrieved documents to generate accurate responses due to the time-sensitive nature of the financial domain. While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

*Amit Kravchik Taub,Fred M. Grabovski,Guy Amit,Yisroel Mirsky*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeakBoost is a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes ML models by synthesizing optimized images to amplify membership signals, significantly boosting membership inference attack performance without modifying existing detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing membership inference attacks rely on static indicators like loss or confidence and fail to fully exploit dynamic model behavior when actively probed, limiting their effectiveness at low false-positive rates.

Method: LeakBoost synthesizes interrogation images by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective to amplify representational differences between member and non-member samples, then analyzes these images with off-the-shelf membership detectors.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements: AUC increased from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and TPR at 1% FPR increased by over an order of magnitude. Deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce strongest leakage, with improvements concentrated in gradient-based detectors.

Conclusion: LeakBoost provides a modular and computationally efficient method for assessing privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference attacks.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a sample was part of a model's training set, posing serious privacy risks for modern machine-learning systems. Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.

Conclusion: 该全异步训练框架有效解决了VLA模型训练的效率瓶颈问题，显著提升了系统吞吐量和资源利用率，为大规模具身智能模型的训练提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a crucial pathway towards general embodied intelligence, yet their training efficiency has become a key bottleneck. Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序知识图谱问答(TKGQA)需要处理时间敏感问题，现有基于LLM的提示策略存在两大局限：1)在复杂时序约束下易产生推理幻觉；2)静态提示缺乏与知识图谱的动态交互优化，限制了模型自主性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出TKG-Thinker智能体，采用双训练策略：1)使用思维链数据进行监督微调(SFT)培养核心规划能力；2)通过多维度奖励强化学习(RL)在复杂时序约束下优化推理策略，实现与TKGs的动态多轮交互和自适应检索。

Conclusion: TKG-Thinker通过自主规划和自适应检索机制有效解决了LLM在时序知识推理中的幻觉和泛化问题，为复杂时序问答提供了新范式。

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging temporal knowledge bases. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

Abstract: We introduce the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) which addresses the optimal assignment of hierarchically structured organizational teams to physical seating arrangements on a floor plan. This problem is driven by the necessity for large organizations with large hierarchies to ensure that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another, such as ensuring a research group occupies a contiguous area. Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by comparing classical and quantum Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.

*Krešimir Kušić,Vinny Cahill,Ivana Dusparic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes GATTF, a geographically-aware Transformer model that uses mutual information between sensors to improve motorway traffic forecasting accuracy without increasing model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital twins for traffic management require accurate predictions of complex, non-linear traffic dynamics; existing deep learning models face limitations in forecasting accuracy and complexity that need improvement.

Method: The authors developed a Transformer-based model (GATTF) that exploits geographical relationships between motorway sensors using mutual information to enhance spatio-temporal traffic forecasting.

Result: Evaluated on real Geneva motorway network data, GATTF achieved higher forecasting accuracy than a standard Transformer model without increasing computational complexity.

Conclusion: Incorporating geographical awareness through mutual information between sensors is an effective approach to improve traffic forecasting accuracy while maintaining model efficiency.

Abstract: The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management depends on the availability of a continuous flow of high-resolution real-time traffic data. To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音情感识别研究因缺乏标准且足够大的数据集而受限。尽管预训练模型已用于下游任务特征提取，但Whisper（ASR系统）在SER中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出两种基于注意力的池化方法（多头注意力平均池化和QKV池化），用于高效降低Whisper表征的维度同时保留情感特征。在IEMOCAP（英语）和ShEMO（波斯语）数据集上，使用Whisper Tiny和Small模型进行实验。

Result: 多头QKV架构在ShEMO数据集上达到SOTA，未加权准确率提升2.47%。研究发现Whisper中间层在波斯语SER上表现更好，相比HuBERT X-Large等大型模型提供了轻量级高效的替代方案。

Conclusion: Whisper作为SER的表征提取器展现出巨大潜力，基于注意力的池化方法能有效降维同时保持情感信息。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research has faced limitations due to the lack of standard and sufficiently large datasets. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly expected to negotiate, coordinate, and transact autonomously, yet existing benchmarks lack principled settings for evaluating language-mediated economic interaction among multiple agents. We introduce AgenticPay, a benchmark and simulation framework for multi-agent buyer-seller negotiation driven by natural language. AgenticPay models markets in which buyers and sellers possess private constraints and product-dependent valuations, and must reach agreements through multi-round linguistic negotiation rather than numeric bidding alone. The framework supports a diverse suite of over 110 tasks ranging from bilateral bargaining to many-to-many markets, with structured action extraction and metrics for feasibility, efficiency, and welfare. Benchmarking state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs reveals substantial gaps in negotiation performance and highlights challenges in long-horizon strategic reasoning, establishing AgenticPay as a foundation for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interaction.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating school security measures in high-risk scenarios such as school shootings, offering experimental control and high behavioral fidelity. However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

Conclusion: DyTopo通过演化的通信图提供可解释的协调轨迹，使研究者能够定性分析多轮迭代中通信路径的动态重构过程。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built from prompted large language models can improve multi-round reasoning, yet most existing pipelines rely on fixed, trajectory-wide communication patterns that are poorly matched to the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem solving. We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges. Across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks and four LLM backbones, DyTopo consistently outperforms over the strongest baseline (avg. +6.2). Beyond accuracy, DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via the evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard randomized fault-injection testing method and state-of-the-art tool stim scale poorly for code distances beyond 10 at low physical error rates, limiting benchmarking capabilities for large quantum error-correction implementations.

Method: The authors combine stratified fault injection (efficiently sampling specific portions of the fault space) with extrapolation techniques to complete the testing task for the remaining space.

Result: Their tool scales to distance 17 for a physical error rate of 0.0005 within a 2-hour desktop time budget, estimating a logical error rate of 1.51 × 10^(-11) with high confidence.

Conclusion: This approach overcomes scalability limitations of existing methods, making large quantum error-correction code benchmarking feasible at low error rates, which is essential for practical quantum computing development.

Abstract: The standard method for benchmarking quantum error-correction is randomized fault-injection testing. The state-of-the-art tool \stim is efficient for error correction implementations with distances of up to 10, but scales poorly to larger distances for low physical error rates. In this paper, we present a scalable approach that combines stratified fault injection with extrapolation. Our insight is that some of the fault space can be sampled efficiently, after which extrapolation is sufficient to complete the testing task. As a result, our tool scales to distance 17 for a physical error rate of 0.0005 with a two-hour time budget on a desktop. For this case, it estimated a logical error rate of $1.51 \times 10^{-11}$ with high confidence.

Abstract: The quantum Fisher information of a quantum state with respect to a certain parameter quantifies the sensitivity of the quantum state to changes in that parameter. Maximizing the quantum Fisher information is essential for achieving the optimal estimation precision of quantum sensors. A typical quantum sensor involves a qubit(e.g. a spin-1/2) probe undergoing an unknown rotation, here the unknown rotation angle is the parameter to be estimated. A well known limitation is that if the rotation axis is unknown, the maximal quantum Fisher information is impossible to attain. This limitation has been lifted recently by leveraging entanglement between the probe qubit and an ancilla qubit. Namely, through measurement of the ancilla after the axis is revealed, one can prepare the probe that is optimal for any unknown rotation axis. This proposal, however, works only for a spin-1/2. Considering large spin probes can achieve a larger quantum Fisher information, offering enhanced metrological advantage, we here utilize the entanglement between a large spin probe and an ancilla to achieve optimal quantum Fisher information for estimating the rotation angle, without prior knowledge of the rotation axis. Different from the previous spin-1/2 case, achieving the optimal precision with large spins generally requires post-selection, resulting in a success probability dependent on the dimension of the Hilbert space. Furthermore, we extend the encoding state from the maximally entangled case to general entangled states, showing that optimal metrology can still be achieved with a certain success probability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子阴影断层扫描是表征量子态的核心任务，但现有研究仅在特殊情况下（如泡利测量与L_∞误差）获得紧样本复杂度边界。本文旨在推广至高精度情形，考虑实际测量约束（如自适应测量、多副本操作），并建立量子学习与计量学的定量联系。

Method: 首先分析一种事后揭示线性组合系数的简化变体，针对单副本测量获得样本复杂度Θ(Γ_p^{ob}/ε²)；进而提出两阶段算法（粗粒度断层扫描结合局部估计），证明原问题的样本复杂度为Θ̃(Γ_p/ε²)，其中Γ_p由费舍尔信息矩阵逆的优化问题定义。

Result: 样本复杂度为Θ̃(Γ_p/ε²)，其中Γ_p为实例相关参数；单副本简化变体下为Θ(Γ_p^{ob}/ε²)，且Γ_p^{ob}_∞=Γ_∞；允许c副本测量时样本复杂度至多改善Ω(1/c)倍；下界适用于无偏有界估计量。

Conclusion: 该工作统一了渐近计量学极限与有限样本学习理论，建立了量子学习与计量学的定量对应关系，为量子态估计提供了普适的理论框架。

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of shadow tomography in the high-precision regime under realistic measurement constraints. Given an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state $ρ$ and a known set of observables $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$, the goal is to estimate expectation values $\{\mathrm{tr}(O_iρ)\}_{i=1}^m$ to accuracy $ε$ in $L_p$-norm, using possibly adaptive measurements that act on $O(\mathrm{polylog}(d))$ number of copies of $ρ$ at a time. We focus on the regime where $ε$ is below an instance-dependent threshold.
  Our main contribution is an instance-optimal characterization of the sample complexity as $\tildeΘ(Γ_p/ε^2)$, where $Γ_p$ is a function of $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$ defined via an optimization formula involving the inverse Fisher information matrix. Previously, tight bounds were known only in special cases, e.g. Pauli shadow tomography with $L_\infty$-norm error. Concretely, we first analyze a simpler oblivious variant where the goal is to estimate an observable of the form $\sum_{i=1}^m α_i O_i$ with $\|α\|_q = 1$ (where $q$ is dual to $p$) revealed after the measurement. For single-copy measurements, we obtain a sample complexity of $Θ(Γ^{\mathrm{ob}}_p/ε^2)$. We then show $\tildeΘ(Γ_p/ε^2)$ is necessary and sufficient for the original problem, with the lower bound applying to unbiased, bounded estimators. Our upper bounds rely on a two-step algorithm combining coarse tomography with local estimation. Notably, $Γ^{\mathrm{ob}}_\infty = Γ_\infty$. In both cases, allowing $c$-copy measurements improves the sample complexity by at most $Ω(1/c)$.
  Our results establish a quantitative correspondence between quantum learning and metrology, unifying asymptotic metrological limits with finite-sample learning guarantees.

Abstract: Simulating quantum many-body systems (QMBS) is one of the long-standing, highly non-trivial challenges in condensed matter physics and quantum information due to the exponentially growing size of the system's Hilbert space. To date, tensor networks have been an essential tool for studying such quantum systems, owing to their ability to efficiently capture the entanglement properties of the systems they represent. One of the well-known tensor network architectures, namely matrix product states (MPS), is the standard method for simulating one-dimensional QMBS. Here, we propose a simple, yet efficient, method to augment the already available MPS algorithms to simulate the dynamics of time-dependent Hamiltonians with better accuracy and a faster convergence rate, giving a second-order convergence compared to the first-order convergence of the standard method. We apply our proposed method to simulate the dynamics of a chain of single spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamonds, which has potential applications for practical and scalable quantum technologies, and find that our method improves the average error for a system of few NV centers by a factor of about 1000 for moderate step sizes. Our work paves the way for efficient simulation of QMBS under the influence of time-dependent Hamiltonians.

Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) give rise to novel dynamical states of quantum matter realized by balancing unitary evolution and measurements. We present large-scale numerical simulations of a trapped-ion native MIPT, argued to belong to the universality class described by the Haar non-unitary conformal field theory. First, through a finite-size analysis we obtained the critical measurement rate, and correlation length exponent, which falls close to the percolation value. Second, by leveraging a monotone computable via semi-definite programming, we uncover robust algebraic decay of genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) versus separation for 2, 3, and 4 parties. The corresponding critical exponents are lower-bounded by those of the multiparty mutual information, which we determine up to 4 parties, and conjecture to be (k+2) for k parties. Additionally, we derive lower bounds for both GME and multiparty mutual information.

Abstract: Although in general boundary conditions do not affect the bulk properties of a system, some of them are special and defy such expectation. This is the case, for instance, of those inducing geometrical frustration in a classical magnet. Recently, the study of such settings in quantum systems (dubbed topological frustration) has uncovered peculiar features, interesting both from a fundamental and technological point of view. In this work, we present and discuss the behavior of several quantum resources in presence of TF, namely the (disconnected) entanglement entropy and the non-stabilizerness Renyi entropy. We will show that, compared to their non-frustrated counterparts, TF adds a distinct contribution to these resources, due to a stable, delocalized, topological excitation. Remarkably, this contribution can be calculated analytically, due to its similarities with that of a W-state.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a quantum-inspired algorithm for classical optimization problems that avoids local minima better than existing methods like simulated annealing, while providing a systematic improvement path and baseline for quantum algorithm development.

Method: Transforms the Ising Hamiltonian via scaling/shifting to make eigenvalues non-negative, represents it as a matrix product operator (MPO), uses truncated MPO-MPO contractions for power iteration amplification, and samples solutions via matrix product state embedding.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on higher-order Ising Hamiltonian problems on heavy-hexagonal lattices, showing superior performance in avoiding local minima compared to simulated annealing, with potential for systematic accuracy improvement through increased bond dimension.

Conclusion: Validates quantum-inspired tensor-network approaches as promising for classical optimization, establishes a benchmark for quantum algorithms, and provides a scalable framework with controllable precision via bond dimension adjustments.

Abstract: We propose a tensor-network (TN) approach for solving classical optimization problems that is inspired by spectral filtering and sampling on quantum states. We first shift and scale an Ising Hamiltonian of the cost function so that all eigenvalues become non-negative and the ground states correspond to the the largest eigenvalues, which are then amplified by power iteration. We represent the transformed Hamiltonian as a matrix product operator (MPO) and form an immense power of this object via truncated MPO-MPO contractions, embedding the resulting operator into a matrix product state for sampling in the computational basis. In contrast to the density-matrix renormalization group, our approach provides a straightforward route to systematic improvement by increasing the bond dimension and is better at avoiding local minima. We also study the performance of this power method in the context of a higher-order Ising Hamiltonian on a heavy-hexagonal lattice, making a comparison with simulated annealing. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired algorithms for solving optimization problems and provide a baseline for assessing and developing quantum algorithms.

Conclusion: 该方法为强度相关实际光源提供了可复现的安全分析方案，显著提升密钥率边界紧度，对实际QKD系统安全性认证具有重要价值

Abstract: Decoy-state QKD with phase-randomized weak coherent pulses is typically analyzed assuming independent, precisely prepared intensities. Real sources, however, can exhibit correlated intensity drift across rounds, potentially leaking intensity information and breaking the standard decoy-state reduction to linear programs. Cauchy--Schwarz (CS) constraints can restore security by coupling $n$-photon yields across intensities, but they introduce nonlinear square-root constraints that are commonly handled via outer linearisation around channel-model-based reference points. We propose a reproducible alternative: first solve the full CS-constrained parameter-estimation problems using the interior-point nonlinear solver IPOPT, then use the resulting candidate solution as the linearisation point for the outer optimisation that certifies a valid lower bound on the asymptotic key rate. Simulations for both coarse-grained model-independent correlations and fine-grained truncated-Gaussian models show consistently tighter key-rate bounds than canonical reference points, and in some cases allow certifying optimality when both optimisation stages coincide.

TL;DR: Investigating Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) error mitigation in distributed quantum computing reveals that Global ZNE (applied before circuit partitioning) outperforms Local ZNE (applied per sub-circuit), achieving up to 48% error reduction across six quantum processing units while showing counterintuitive benefits from increased QPU count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing errors are the main bottleneck for practical applications, and this challenge worsens in distributed architectures due to additional network communication noise. While ZNE works for standalone processors, its effectiveness in distributed settings is poorly understood.

Method: The authors compare Global ZNE (applying error extrapolation before circuit partitioning) against Local ZNE (applying independently to each sub-circuit). They transform monolithic circuits into distributed implementations by inserting noisy teleportation primitives, then evaluate both approaches across varying QPU counts and heterogeneous local/network noise conditions.

Result: Global ZNE demonstrates superior scalability with up to 48% error reduction across six QPUs. Counterintuitively, increasing QPU count improves mitigation effectiveness despite higher communication overhead, revealing unexpected noise behavior.

Conclusion: The study highlights fundamental trade-offs in distributed quantum error mitigation and raises new questions about the interplay between circuit structure, partitioning strategies, and network noise characteristics.

Abstract: Errors are the primary bottleneck preventing practical quantum computing. This challenge is exacerbated in the distributed quantum computing regime, where quantum networks introduce additional communication-induced noise. While error mitigation techniques such as Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) have proven effective for standalone quantum processors, their behavior in distributed architectures is not yet well understood. We investigate ZNE in this setting by comparing Global optimization (ZNE is applied prior to circuit partitioning), against Local optimization (ZNE is applied independently to each sub-circuit). Partitioning is performed on a monolithic circuit, which is then transformed into a distributed implementation by inserting noisy teleportation-based communication primitives between sub-circuits. We evaluate both approaches across varying numbers of quantum processing units (QPUs) and under heterogeneous local and network noise conditions. Our results demonstrate that Global ZNE exhibits superior scalability, achieving error reductions of up to $48\%$ across six QPUs. Moreover, we observe counterintuitive noise behavior, where increasing the number of QPUs improves mitigation effectiveness despite higher communication overhead. These findings highlight fundamental trade-offs in distributed quantum error mitigation and raise new questions regarding the interplay between circuit structure, partitioning strategies, and network noise.

Abstract: Statistical functions such as the moment-generating function, characteristic function, cumulant-generating function, and second characteristic function are cornerstone tools in classical statistics and probability theory. They provide a powerful means to analyze the statistical properties of a system and find applications in diverse fields, including statistical physics and field theory. While these functions are ubiquitous in classical theory, a quantum counterpart has remained elusive due to the fundamental hurdle of noncommutativity of operators. The lack of such a framework has obscured the deep connections between standard statistical measures and the non-classical features of quantum mechanics. Here, we establish a comprehensive framework for quantum statistical functions that transcends these limitations, naturally unifying the disparate languages of standard quantum statistics, quasiprobability distributions, and weak values. We show that these functions, defined as expectation values with respect to the purified state, naturally reproduce fundamental quantum statistical quantities like expectation values, variance, and covariance upon differentiation. Crucially, by extending this framework to include the concepts of pre- and post-selection, we define conditional quantum statistical functions that uniquely yield weak values and weak variance. We further demonstrate that multivariable quantum statistical functions, when defined with specific operator orderings, correspond to well-known quasiprobability distributions. Our framework provides a cohesive mathematical structure that not only reproduces standard quantum statistical measures but also incorporates nonclassical features of quantum mechanics, thus laying the foundation for a deeper understanding of quantum statistics.

Abstract: In contrast to classical cryptography, where the security of encoded messages typically relies on the inability of standard algorithms to overcome computational complexity assumptions, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can enable two spatially separated parties to establish an information-theoretically secure encryption, provided that the QKD protocol is underpinned by a security proof. In the last decades, security proofs robust against a wide range of eavesdropping strategies have established the theoretical soundness of several QKD protocols. However, most proofs are based on idealized models of the physical systems involved in such protocols and often include assumptions that are not satisfied in practical implementations. This mismatch creates a gap between theoretical security guarantees and actual experimental realizations, making QKD protocols vulnerable to attacks. To ensure the security of real-world QKD systems, it is therefore essential to account for imperfections in security analyses. In this article, we present an overview of recent analytical and numerical developments in QKD security proofs, which provide a versatile approach for incorporating imperfections and re-establishing the security of quantum communication protocols under realistic conditions.

### [68] [Learning fermionic linear optics with Heisenberg scaling and physical operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05058)
*Aria Christensen,Andrew Zhao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了高效且物理可实现的费米子线性光学（FLO）学习协议，显著降低查询复杂度至Õ(n⁴/ε)（主动FLO）和O(n³/ε)（被动FLO），首次实现海森堡精度的同时遵守费米子超选择规则，仅需最多1个辅助模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先前FLO学习算法存在的高查询复杂度（Õ(n⁵/ε²)）、违反费米子超选择规则以及需n个辅助模式制备Choi态的问题，使其更适用于物理实验实现。

Method: 设计符合超选择规则的新协议，采用最小化辅助模式（最多1个额外模式），区分处理主动（任意）和被动（守恒粒子数）FLO两种情形，优化查询复杂度对n和ε的依赖。

Result: 1. 主动FLO查询复杂度降至Õ(n⁴/ε)；被动FLO降至O(n³/ε)。2. 主动情形使用n个辅助模式时可进一步优化至Õ(n³/ε)。3. 首次实现海森堡精度（O(1/ε)）。4. 附带改进Slater行列式态层析的复制复杂度至Õ(nη²/ε²)。

Conclusion: 该协议是首个达到海森堡精度的FLO学习算法，在保持物理可实现性（遵守超选择规则、仅需极少量辅助模式）的同时大幅提升效率，对实验量子模拟和费米子系统表征具有重要意义。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of learning fermionic linear optics (FLO), also known as fermionic Gaussian unitaries. Given black-box query access to an unknown FLO, previous proposals required $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^5 / \varepsilon^2)$ queries, where $n$ is the system size and $\varepsilon$ is the error in diamond distance. These algorithms also use unphysical operations (i.e., violating fermionic superselection rules) and/or $n$ auxiliary modes to prepare Choi states of the FLO. In this work, we establish efficient and experimentally friendly protocols that obey superselection, use minimal ancilla (at most $1$ extra mode), and exhibit improved dependence on both parameters $n$ and $\varepsilon$. For arbitrary (active) FLOs this algorithm makes at most $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^4 / \varepsilon)$ queries, while for number-conserving (passive) FLOs we show that $\mathcal{O}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ queries suffice. The complexity of the active case can be further reduced to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ at the cost of using $n$ ancilla. This marks the first FLO learning algorithm that attains Heisenberg scaling in precision. As a side result, we also demonstrate an improved copy complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n η^2 / \varepsilon^2)$ for time-efficient state tomography of $η$-particle Slater determinants in $\varepsilon$ trace distance, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Hamiltonian representations based on the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy provide rigorous lower bounds on ground-state energies and facilitate the design of efficient classical and quantum simulation algorithms. This work presents a unified framework connecting SOS decompositions with variational two-particle reduced density matrix (v2RDM) theory. We demonstrate that the ``weighted'' SOS ansatz naturally recovers the dual of the v2RDM program, enabling the strict enforcement of symmetry constraints such as particle number and spin. We provide explicit SOS constructions for the Hubbard model and electronic structure Hamiltonians, ranging from spin-free approximations to full rank-2 expansions. We also highlight theoretical connections to block-invariant symmetry shifts. Numerical benchmarks on molecular systems and Iron-Sulfur clusters validate these near frustration-free representations, demonstrating their utility in improving spectral gap amplification and reducing block encoding costs in quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Nonlinear spectroscopic techniques using entangled photon pairs provide an opportunity to exploit non-classical correlations encoded in two-photon wavefunctions to manipulate two-exciton wavefunctions. We propose an entangled photon pair-enhanced multidimensional spectroscopic technique which is sensitive to exciton-exciton interactions and correlations at the ultrafast timescale. Simulations for a dissipative photosynthetic aggregate reveal the superior ability of entangled photon pairs, compared to both transform-limited and frequency-chirped laser pulses, to manipulate excited-state absorption pathways. The corresponding spectral features in the two-dimensional spectrogram are interpreted in terms of one- and two-exciton resonances. The signal scales linearly with the incoming intensity of the photon sources. It is argued that classifying these resonances using entangled photon source at the perturbative limit allow for probing exciton correlations at the natural energy scale. These insights can be used to explore multi-exciton dynamics using multiphoton entanglement.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of time quasicrystals (TQCs) in the open Dicke model, subjected to a quasi-periodic Fibonacci drive. TQCs are characterized by a robust sub-harmonic quasi-periodic response that is qualitatively distinct from the external drive. By directly analyzing the dynamics of the system in the thermodynamic limit, we establish the existence of TQC order in this system for a wide parameter regime. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this behavior persists even in the deep quantum regime with only two qubits. We systematically study the dependence of the TQC lifetime, $τ^{\ast}$, on the number of qubits and demonstrate that $τ^{\ast}$ increases monotonically with the system size. Our work demonstrates that quasi-periodically driven dissipative quantum systems can serve as a powerful platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium phases of matter.

Abstract: This work introduces and characterizes quantum sequential circuits (QSCs) as a hardware-oriented paradigm for quantum computing, built upon a novel foundational element termed the quantum transistor. Unlike conventional qubit-based architectures, QSCs employ symmetry-protected topological junctions where quantum gates are encoded as Choi states via channel-state duality and activated through bulk measurements, utilizing ebits to realize the functional analog of feedback loops in classical sequential circuits. This framework establishes a universal model for quantum computation that inherently incorporates memory and temporal sequencing, complementing existing combinational quantum circuit model. Our work advances the conceptual bridge towards a quantum von Neumann architecture, underscoring the potential of hybrid and modular design principles for the development of large-scale, integrated quantum information processors.

Conclusion: 该研究为动态数字信号处理提供了关键安全框架，克服了高性能连续变量量子密钥分发系统发展的重大障碍，确保了实际系统的安全性。

Abstract: Digital signal processing technology has paved the way for the realization of high-speed continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems. However, existing security proofs are limited to static digital signal processing algorithms, while practical systems rely on dynamic multiple-input multiple-output algorithms to compensate for time-varying channel impairments. Our analysis reveals that the conventional dynamic algorithm, due to its non-unitary nature, systematically underestimates the excess noise, which in turn leads to security issues and the generation of insecure keys. To close this gap, we propose a secure algorithm model, mapping the dynamic algorithm to an equivalent physical optical model whose security can be rigorously assessed. Simulations illustrate the algorithm's non-unitary property and provide a quantitative analysis of the excess noise underestimation caused by the conventional algorithm. We further experimentally validate the necessity of the proposed modeling for dynamic digital signal processing, achieving a secret key rate of 14.4 Mbps based on estimated excess noise of 0.07 shot noise unit; whereas the conventional algorithm would have dangerously overestimated the key rate to 28.2 Mbps with noise of 0.008 shot noise unit. This work provides the essential security framework for dynamic digital signal processing, overcoming a critical impediment for the development of high-performance continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems.

Abstract: We quantify the quantum-to-classical transition of the single-mode Kerr nonlinear dynamics in the presence of loss. We establish three time scales that govern the dynamics, each with distinct characteristics. For times short compared to the Ehrenfest time, the evolution is classical, characterized by Gaussian dynamics. For sufficiently long times, as we increase the initial photon number, unitary Kerr evolution would generate macroscopic superpositions of coherent states (so-called kitten states), but this is severely restricted in the presence of small photon loss so that expectation values of observables coincide with their classical values. The intermediate time scale, however, shows resilient quantum behavior in the macroscopic limit. We show that in the mean-field non-Gaussian regime, the Kerr Hamiltonian (with small photon loss) generates a significant amount of Wigner-negativity, and classical flow is recovered only if the loss rate grows with system size. Our results broaden the usual understanding of quantum-to-classical transitions and demonstrate the potential for creating robust nonclassical resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing in the presence of loss.

Abstract: We investigate the scattering of a charged quantum particle in a helically twisted background that induces an effective Coulomb-like interaction, in the presence of an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux. Starting from the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation in the twisted metric, we derive the radial equation and show that, after including the AB potential, it can be mapped onto the same Kummer-type differential equation that governs the planar $2D$ Coulomb $+$ AB problem, with a geometry-induced Coulomb strength and the azimuthal quantum number shifted as $m\to m-λ$. We construct the exact scattering solutions, obtain closed expressions for the partial-wave $S$ matrix and phase shifts, and derive the corresponding scattering amplitude, differential cross section, and total cross section. We also show that the pole structure of the $S$ matrix is consistent with the bound-state quantization previously obtained for the helically twisted Coulomb-like problem.

Abstract: The emergence of the Barren Plateau phenomenon poses a significant challenge to quantum machine learning. While most Barren Plateau analyses focus on single-qubit rotation gates, the gradient behavior of Parameterized Quantum Circuits built from multi-qubit gates remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a general theoretical framework for analyzing the gradient properties of Parameterized Quantum Circuits with multi-qubit gates. Our method generalizes the direct computation framework, bypassing the Haar random assumption on parameters and enabling the calculation of the gradient expectation and variance. We apply this framework to single-layer and deep-layer circuits, deriving analytical results that quantify how gradient variance is co-determined by the size of the multi-qubit gate and the number of qubits, layers, and effective parameters. Numerical simulations validate our findings. Our study provides a refined framework for analyzing and optimizing Parameterized Quantum Circuits with complex multi-qubit gates.

Abstract: Quantum metrology harnesses quantum entanglement to improve measurement precision beyond standard quantum limit. Although nonlinear interaction is essential for generating entanglement, during signal accumulation, it becomes detrimental and therefore must be suppressed. To address this challenge, we propose an alternating in-phase and quadrature modulation (AIQM) scheme, designed to operate under a fixed nonlinear interaction. During signal accumulation, our time-interleaved approach sequentially applies the in-phase and quadrature driving fields, thereby eliminating the effects of nonlinear interaction on signal accumulation. Our AIQM scheme achieves better metrological performance than conventional schemes, particularly under strong nonlinear interaction and prolonged signal accumulation, with pronounced robustness against parameter variations. By selectively eliminating and utilizing nonlinear interactions via AIQM, our work enables high-precision and high-accuracy entanglement-enhanced sensing without the need for active control of the nonlinear interaction.

Abstract: Matchgate unitaries are ubiquitous in quantum computation due to their relation to non-interacting fermions and because they can be used to benchmark quantum computers. Implementing such unitaries on fault-tolerant devices requires first compiling them into a discrete universal gate set, typically Clifford$+T$. Here, we propose a different approach for their synthesis: compile matchgate unitaries using only matchgate gates. To this end, we first show that the matchgate-Clifford group (the intersection of the matchgate and Clifford groups) plus the $\overline{T}$ gate (a $T$ unitary up to a phase) is universal for the matchgate group. Our approach leverages the connection between $n$-qubit matchgate circuits and the standard representation of $\mathbb{SO}(2n)$, which reduces the compilation from $2^n\times 2^n$ unitaries to $2n\times2n$ ones, thus reducing exponentially the size of the target matrix. Moreover, we rigorously show that this scheme is efficient, as an approximation error $\varepsilon_{\mathbb{SO}(2n)}$ incurred in this smaller-dimensional representation translates at most into an $O(n \,\varepsilon_{\mathbb{SO}(2n)})$ error in the exponentially large unitary. In addition, we study the exact version of the matchgate synthesis problem, and we prove that all matchgate unitaries $U$ such that $U\otimes U^*$ has entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}\big[1/\sqrt 2,i\big]$ can be exactly synthesized by a finite sequence of gates from the matchgate-Clifford$+\overline{T}$ set, without ancillas. We then use this insight to map optimal exact matchgate synthesis to Boolean satisfiability, and compile the circuits that diagonalize the free-fermionic $XX$ Hamiltonian on $n=4,\,8$ qubits.

Conclusion: DEM建立了量子实验与经典算法的直接成本对比基准，为含噪声量子设备提供可扩展的评估方案，证明中等规模量子系统在特定错误率下可达到经典计算相当的性价比。

Abstract: Noisy quantum annealing experiments on Rydberg atom arrays produce measurement outcomes that deviate from ideal distributions, complicating performance evaluation. To enable a data-driven benchmarking methodology for quantum devices that accounts for both solution quality and the classical computational cost of inference from noisy measurements, we introduce deterministic error mitigation (DEM), a shot-level inference procedure informed by experimentally characterized noise. We demonstrate this approach using the decision version of the $k$-independent set problem. Within a Hamming-shell framework, the DEM candidate volume is governed by the binary entropy of the bit-flip error rate, yielding an entropy-controlled classical postprocessing cost. Using experimental measurement data, DEM reduces postprocessing overhead relative to classical inference baselines. Numerical simulations and experimental results from neutral atom devices validate the predicted scaling with system size and error rate. These scalings indicate that one hour of classical computation on an Intel i9 processor corresponds to neutral atom experiments with up to $N=250-450$ atoms at effective error rates, enabling a direct, cost-based comparison between noisy quantum experiments and classical algorithms.

Abstract: The no-signalling principle is a fundamental assumption in Bell-inequality and quantum-steering experiments. Nonetheless, experimental imperfections can lead to apparent violations beyond those expected from finite-sample statistics. Here, we propose extensions of local hidden variable and local hidden state theories that allow for bounded, operationally quantifiable, amounts of signalling. We show how non-classicality tests can be developed for these models, both through exact methods based on the full set of observed statistics and through corrections to the standard Bell and steering inequalities. We demonstrate the applicability of these methods via two scenarios that feature apparent signalling: an IBM quantum processor and post-selected data from inefficient detectors.

Abstract: Among the intriguing features of quantum theory, the problem of distinguishing quantum channels is of fundamental interest. In this paper, we focus on the single-shot discrimination of two noisy quantum channels using two distinct classes of probes: single-system (product) probes and entangled probes. Our aim is to identify optimal probing state for specific discrimination tasks and to analyze the necessity and role of entanglement in enhancing channel distinguishability. We show that maximally entangled probes are optimal for discriminating two qubit depolarizing channels, with any nonzero entanglement providing an advantage over single-system probes. In contrast, for dephasing channels in arbitrary dimensions, we prove that single-system probe can be optimal and that entanglement offers no improvement, even when the dephasing unitary is generalized. For qubit amplitude-damping channels, we identify distinct noise-dependent regimes in which either single-system probe outperforms maximally entangled probes and vice-versa. Moreover, we demonstrate that non-maximally entangled probes can act as the optimum probe if the noise parameters restricted to certain values in this task. We also present examples of noisy unitary channels for which discrimination is possible using non-maximally entangled probe, while both single-systems and maximally entangled probes fail. We introduce another class of noisy unitary channels for which perfect discrimination is achievable with a single system, while maximally entangled probes are insufficient. Finally, we show that two erasure channels can be optimally discriminated using any pure single-system probe, with no advantage gained from entanglement.

Abstract: This work presents a theoretical model of boson sampling with optical feedback, in which a subset of the interferometer's output modes is looped back into the input modes. If the bosons are injected periodically into the input modes of the interferometer and optical feedback lines' length match the period of injection, it allows for interference between bosons injected at the consequent time iterations. We propose several methods methods for computing the output photon distributions in both output spacial and temporal modes, including not only standard spatiotemporal mode-unfolding technique, but also the Kraus-operator formalism, and a correlation-tensor-based approach. The two latter approaches help us to reveal that for random interferometers this system evolves to a unique stationary state over time. Because of the existence of the stationary state, we introduce new computational problem \textit{Stationary Distribution Boson Sampling} which appears to be harder than conventional boson sampling problem and contains it as a special case when there are no optical feedback lines.

Conclusion: CAIM成功突破传统AIM理论性能上限，验证了所建理论框架的有效性与可解释性，为模拟计算架构提供新范式

Abstract: As a quantum-inspired, non-traditional analog solver architecture, the analog Ising machine (AIM) has emerged as a distinctive computational paradigm to address the rapidly growing demand for computational power. However, the mathematical understanding of its principles, as well as the optimization of its solution speed and accuracy, remain unclear. In this work, we for the first time systematically discuss multiple implementations of AIM and establish a unified mathematical formulation. On this basis, by treating the binarization constraint of AIM (such as injection locking) as a Lagrange multiplier in optimization theory and combining it with a Lyapunov analysis from dynamical systems theory, an analytical framework for evaluating solution speed and accuracy is constructed, and further demonstrate that conventional AIMs possess a theoretical performance upper bound. Subsequently, by elevating the binarization constraint to a control variable, we propose the controllable analog Ising machine (CAIM), which integrates control Lyapunov functions and momentum-based optimization algorithms to realize adaptive sampling-feedback control, thereby surpassing the performance limits of conventional AIMs. In a proof-of-concept CAIM demonstration implemented using an FPGA-controlled LC-oscillator Ising machine, CAIM achieves a twofold speedup and a 7\% improvement in accuracy over AIM on a 50-node all-to-all weighted MaxCut problem, validating both the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed theoretical framework.

Abstract: Quantum processes, including quantum gates and channels, are integral to various quantum information tasks, making the efficient characterization of these processes and their underlying noise critically important. Here, we propose a framework for quantum process tomography in the presence of corrupted noise that is able to simultaneously reconstruct the process and corrupted noise. Firstly, within the Choi-state representation, we derive the corresponding generalized restricted isometry property and demonstrate the simultaneous reconstruction of various quantum gates under sparse noise. Moreover, in comparison with the Choi-state scheme, the process-matrix representation is employed to simultaneously reconstruct sparse noise and a broader range of target quantum gates. Our results demonstrate that significant reduction in experimental configurations is achievable even under corrupted noise.

Abstract: Light-matter interfaces are pivotal for quantum computation and communication. While typically analyzed using single-mode or open-quantum-system approximations, these models often neglect multi-mode field states and light-matter entanglement, hindering exact protocol modeling. Here, we solve the full Hamiltonian dynamics of a solid-state spin-photon interface for three key protocols: the generation of photon-number superpositions, a controlled photon-photon gate, and the production of photonic cluster states. By deriving exact fidelities, we identify fundamental performance limits. Our results reveal that while realistic imperfections severely limit photon-photon gates, they only slightly affect linear photonic clusters and are nearly harmless for photon-number state superpositions.

Abstract: Nuclear spins provide an ideal platform for studying quantum correlations and open quantum system dynamics across diverse areas, including quantum information, quantum foundations, and many-body physics. This is enabled by their long longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) coherence times and precise control using radio frequency pulses. In this thesis, I present my work using nuclear spins to explore these themes.
  First, I study temporal quantum correlations quantified by the Leggett Garg inequality (LGI) for a qubit evolving under a superposition of unitary operators. Using a three qubit quantum register, we experimentally realized superposed unitaries and observed LGI violations exceeding the maximal quantum bound of 1.5, indicating enhanced non-classicality. Notably, this superposed unitary dynamics also showed improved robustness against decoherence.
  Next, I investigate Lee Yang zeros, which are zeros of the partition function in the complex plane that reveal thermodynamic behavior near criticality. We proposed and experimentally demonstrated a method to determine the full set of Lee Yang zeros of an asymmetric Ising model using a single quantum probe in a three-qubit nuclear spin register. We further showed that the mutual information between the probe and system peaks at times corresponding to these zeros.
  I then report our study of the quantum Mpemba effect in nuclear spin relaxation, where systems farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to steady state, verified both theoretically and experimentally using NMR. Finally, I discuss our work on entanglement localization and delocalization induced by local interactions, leading to an apparent violation of the quantum data processing inequality. We showed that this violation is only apparent by constructing a completely positive and trace preserving map describing the dynamics.

Abstract: In this work, we address the numerical identification of entanglement in dynamical scenarios. To this end, we consider different programs based on the restriction of the evolution to the set of separable (i.e., non-entangled) states, together with the discretization of the space of variables for numerical computations. As a first approach, we apply linear splitting methods to the restricted, continuous equations of motion derived from variational principles. We utilize an exchange interaction Hamiltonian to confirm that the numerical and analytical solutions coincide in the limit of small time steps. The application to different Hamiltonians shows the wide applicability of the method to detect dynamical entanglement. To avoid the derivation of analytical solutions for complex dynamics, we consider variational, numerical integration schemes, introducing a variational discretization for Lagrangians linear in velocities. Here, we examine and compare two approaches: one in which the system is discretized before the restriction is applied, and another in which the restriction precedes the discretization. We find that the "first-discretize-then-restrict" method becomes numerically unstable, already for the example of an exchange-interaction Hamiltonian, which can be an important consideration for the numerical analysis of constrained quantum dynamics. Thereby, broadly applicable numerical tools, including their limitations, for studying entanglement over time are established for assessing the entangling power of processes that are used in quantum information theory.

Abstract: Quantum control has been a cornerstone of quantum information science, driving major advances in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. Over the years, it has enabled the implementation of arbitrary completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) maps; an important next step is to extend control to Hermitian-preserving and trace-preserving (HPTP) maps, which underpin applications such as entanglement detection, quantum error mitigation, quantum simulation, and quantum machine learning. Here we present an efficient and fully constructive method for implementing arbitrary HPTP maps. Unlike existing methods that decompose an HPTP map into multiple CPTP maps or approximate it using bipartite Hamiltonians with large Hilbert spaces, our approach compiles a target HPTP map into a single executable CPTP map whose Kraus rank is guaranteed to be no larger than the intrinsic rank of the target HPTP map plus one, followed by simple classical post-processing. Numerical results for inverse noise channels used in quantum error mitigation, including bosonic photon loss, confirm substantial reductions in resources and highlight scalability in higher-dimensional settings. Together with our numerical benchmarks, these results validate the efficiency and versatility of the proposed framework, opening a route to broader quantum-information applications enabled by HPTP processing.

Abstract: The use of tantalum films for superconducting qubits has recently extended qubit coherence times significantly, primarily due to reduced dielectric losses at the metal-air interface. However, the choice of base material also influences the sensitivity to quasiparticle-induced decoherence. In this study, we investigate quasiparticle tunneling rates in niobium and tantalum-based offset-charge-sensitive qubits. Using a source of thermal radiation, we characterize the sensitivity of either material to infrared radiation and explore the impact of the infrared background through the targeted use of in-line filters in the wiring and ambient infrared absorbers. We identify both radiation channels as significant contributions to decoherence for tantalum but not for niobium qubits and achieve tunneling rates of 100 Hz and 300 Hz for niobium and tantalum respectively upon installation of infrared filters. Additionally, we find a time-dependence in the observed tunneling rates on the scale of days, which we interpret as evidence of slowly cooling, thermally radiating components in the experimental setup. Our findings indicate that continued improvements in coherence times may require renewed attention to radiative backgrounds and experimental setup design, especially when introducing new material platforms.

Abstract: Transformations of quantum channels, such as the transpose, complex conjugate, and adjoint, are fundamental to quantum information theory. Given access to an unknown channel, a central problem is whether these transformations can be implemented physically with quantum supermaps. While such supermaps are known for unitary operations, the situation for general quantum channels is fundamentally different. In this work, we establish a strict hierarchy of physical realizability for the transposition, complex conjugation, and adjoint transformation of an unknown quantum channel. We present a probabilistic protocol that exactly implements the transpose with a single query. In contrast, we prove no-go theorems showing that neither the complex conjugate nor the adjoint can be implemented by any completely positive supermap, even probabilistically. We then overcome this impossibility by designing a virtual protocol for the complex conjugate based on quasi-probability decomposition, and show its optimality in terms of the diamond norm. As a key application, we propose a protocol to estimate the expectation values resulting from the Petz recovery map of an unknown channel, achieving an improved query complexity compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) achieves information-theoretic security, without relying on computational assumptions, by distributing quantum states. To establish secret bits, two honest parties exploit key distillation protocols over measurement outcomes resulting after the the distribution of quantum states. In this work, we establish a rigorous connection between the key rate achievable by applying two-way key distillation, such as advantage distillation, and quantum asymptotic hypothesis testing, via an integral representation of the relative entropy. This connection improves key rates at small to intermediate blocklengths relative to existing fidelity-based bounds and enables the computation of entropy bounds for intermediate to large blocklengths. Moreover, this connection allows one to close the gap between known sufficient and conjectured necessary conditions for key generation in the asymptotic regime, while the precise finite blocklegth conditions remain open. More broadly, our work shows how advances in quantum multiple hypothesis testing can directly sharpen the security analyses of QKD.

Abstract: Random thermal states of many-body Hamiltonians underpin studies of thermalization, chaos, and quantum phase transitions, yet their generation remains costly when each Hamiltonian must be prepared individually. We introduce the thermal-drift channel, a measurement-based operation that implements a tunable nonunitary drift along a chosen Pauli term. Based on this channel, we present a measurement-controlled sampling algorithm that generates thermal states together with their Hamiltonian "labels" for general physical models. We prove that the total gate count of our algorithm scales cubically with system size, quadratically with inverse temperature, and as the inverse error tolerance to the two-thirds power, with logarithmic dependence on the allowed failure probability. We also show that the induced label distribution approaches a normal distribution reweighted by the thermal partition function, which makes an explicit trade-off between accuracy and effective range. Numerical simulations for a 2D Heisenberg model validate the predicted scaling and distribution. As an application, we compute unfolding-free level-spacing ratio statistics from sampled thermal states of a 2D transverse-field Ising model and observe a crossover toward the Wigner--Dyson prediction, demonstrating a practical and scalable route to chaos diagnostics and random matrix universality studies on near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for binary optimization problems have been the subject of extensive study. However, the application of quantum algorithms to integer optimization problems remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we study the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) applied to integer problems on graphs, with each integer variable encoded in a qudit. We derive a general iterative formula for depth-$p$ QAOA expectation on high-girth $d$-regular graphs of arbitrary size. The cost of evaluating the formula is exponential in the QAOA depth $p$ but does not depend on the graph size. Evaluating this formula for Max-$k$-Cut problem for $p\leq 4$, we identify parameter regimes ($k=3$ with degree $d \leq 10$ and $k=4$ with $d \leq 40$) in which QAOA outperforms the Frieze-Jerrum semi-definite programming (SDP) algorithm, which provides the best worst-case guarantee on the approximation ratio. To strengthen the classical baseline we introduce a new heuristic algorithm, based on the degree-of-saturation, that empirically outperforms both the Frieze-Jerrum algorithm and shallow-depth QAOA. Nevertheless, we provide numerical evidence that QAOA may overtake this heuristic at depth $p\leq 20$. Our results show that moving beyond binary to integer optimization problems can open up new avenues for quantum advantage.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a one-way quantum secure direct communication model using finite EPR pairs and a public classical channel, where the secret bit is the choice of measurement basis. It achieves information-theoretic security against symmetric attacks and is suitable for star networks without requiring local unitary operations by the receiver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The distinguishability of ensembles described by the same compressed density operator and the need for practical quantum secure direct communication.

Method: Using quantum wiretap channel theory to analyze secure net bit rates and security under BB84-symmetric attacks, with encoding and decoding via measurements in computational or Hadamard bases on EPR pairs.

Result: The study provides secure net bit rates and certifies information-theoretic security for different implementations of the model under symmetric attacks.

Conclusion: The model is suitable for real-life implementation in star network configurations due to the absence of required local unitary operations by the receiver.

Abstract: Motivated by the question of the distinguishability of ensembles described by the same compressed density operator, we propose a model for one-way quantum secure direct communication using finite ensembles of shared EPR pairs per bit and a public authenticated classical channel, where the local choice of one of two mutually-unbiased measurement bases is the secret bit. In this model, both the encoding and decoding of classical information in quantum systems are implemented by measurements in either the computational or the Hadamard basis. Using the quantum wiretap channel theory, we study the secure net bit rates and certify information-theoretic security of different implementations of our model when the quantum channel is subjected to BB84-symmetric attacks. Since no local unitary operations need to be performed by the receiver, the proposed model is suitable for real-life implementation of secure direct communication in star network configurations.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that geometric series of time samples provides near-optimal, robust optimization for the Rodeo Algorithm's dual applications (energy spectrum computation and eigenstate preparation) across varied quantum Hamiltonians while maintaining exponential performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the Rodeo Algorithm's performance for two key quantum computing tasks: calculating energy spectra and preparing energy eigenstates.

Method: Implemented geometric series time sampling, analyzed on a representative model Hamiltonian for gapped many-body systems, provided analytical justification, and tested on diverse physical Hamiltonians.

Result: This sampling strategy achieves near-optimal performance for given total runtime, preserves the algorithm's exponential scaling under specific conditions, and demonstrates practical robustness across different quantum systems.

Conclusion: Geometric time series offers a practical, near-optimal, and robust sampling protocol that eliminates the need for model-specific fine-tuning in quantum state preparation using the Rodeo Algorithm.

Abstract: The Rodeo Algorithm is a quantum computing method for computing the energy spectrum of a Hamiltonian and preparing its energy eigenstates. We discuss how to improve the performance of the rodeo algorithm for each of these two applications. In particular, we demonstrate that using a geometric series of time samples offers a near-optimal optimization space for a given total runtime by studying the Rodeo Algorithm performance on a model Hamiltonian representative of gapped many-body quantum systems. Analytics explain the performance of this time sampling and the conditions for it to maintain the established exponential performance of the Rodeo Algorithm. We finally demonstrate this sampling protocol on various physical Hamiltonians, showing its practical applicability. Our results suggest that geometric series of times provide a practical, near-optimal, and robust time-sampling strategy for quantum state preparation with the Rodeo Algorithm across varied Hamiltonians without requiring model-specific fine-tuning.

### [99] [Improving Ground State Accuracy of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers with Soft-coded Orthogonal Subspace Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05980)
*Giuseppe Clemente,Marco Intini*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Proposes a novel subspace-based VQE method using soft-coded orthogonality constraints via penalty terms instead of hard-coded circuit-level constraints, achieving shallower circuits and high fidelity for ground state estimation on quantum spin models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve accuracy of ground state estimates in VQE algorithms by developing a more efficient subspace representation that reduces quantum circuit depth while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: Employ subspace representations with soft-coded orthogonality constraints (penalty terms in cost function) instead of hard-coded constraints at the circuit level, then diagonalize the Hamiltonian restricted to the subspace.

Result: The proposed method produces shallower quantum circuits while maintaining high fidelity compared to standard VQE, SSVQE, and MCVQE on benchmark cases: 3×3 transverse-field Ising model and 4×4 Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model.

Conclusion: Soft-coded orthogonality constraints via penalty terms offer a more efficient subspace-based VQE approach, enabling shallower circuits with comparable accuracy to existing multi-state VQE methods.

Abstract: We propose a new approach to improve the accuracy of ground state estimates in Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms by employing subspace representations with soft-coded orthogonality constraints. As in other subspace-based VQE methods, such as the Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) and Multistate Contracted VQE (MCVQE), once the parameters are optimized to maximize the subspace overlap with the low-energy sector of the Hamiltonian, one diagonalizes the Hamiltonian restricted to the subspace. Unlike these methods, where \emph{hard-coded} orthogonality constraints are enforced at the circuit level among the states spanning the subspace, we consider a subspace representation where orthogonality is \emph{soft-coded} via penalty terms in the cost function. We show that this representation allows for shallower quantum circuits while maintaining high fidelity when compared to single-state (standard VQE) and multi-state (SSVQE or MCVQE) representations, on two benchmark cases: a $3\times 3$ transverse-field Ising model and random realizations of the Edwards--Anderson spin-glass model on a $4\times 4$ lattice.

Motivation: 揭示连续工作多参数量子传感器的基本噪声机制和资源依赖的权衡关系，对于实现其最优操作和性能极限至关重要。

Method: 采用混合射频-直流光泵磁力仪，在保持量子噪声限制的前提下，系统测量光子散粒噪声、自旋投影噪声和测量反作用噪声随探针功率（变化一个数量级）和泵浦功率（变化三倍）的变化，并通过随机布洛赫方程模型进行定量分析。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了连续监测多参数传感器特有的基本资源依赖权衡关系，并从实验上确立了其最优运行的量子极限，为量子传感器的优化设计提供了重要依据。

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the quantum noise mechanisms that limit continuously operating multiparameter quantum sensors. Using a hybrid rf-dc optically pumped magnetometer, we map the photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise over an order of magnitude in probe power and a factor of three in pump power while remaining quantum-noise-limited. We observe linear, quadratic, and cubic scaling of the respective total noise powers with probe photon flux, together with a quadratic dependence of back-action on pump photon flux, in quantitative agreement with a stochastic Bloch-equation model. At higher probe powers, additional probe-induced relaxation modifies the spin-noise spectrum while preserving the integrated noise scaling. Our results reveal fundamental, resource-dependent trade-offs unique to continuously monitored multiparameter sensors and establish experimentally the quantum limits governing their optimal operation.

Conclusion: 量子信息不等式为约束非平衡RG流和相稳定性提供普适框架，可推广至经典非平衡稳态系统，为理解量子相变和退相干驱动转变提供新工具。

Abstract: We derive constraints on renormalization group (RG) flows and stability of phases in nonequilibrium systems using quantum information inequalities. These constraints involve conditional mutual information (CMI), which quantifies correlations between spatially separated regions not mediated by their surroundings. First, assuming CMI is UV finite, we show that the scaling function associated with CMI is monotonic along the RG flow. This implies a non-perturbative stability criterion: a fixed point with smaller CMI cannot be destabilized toward one with larger CMI. Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry. We illustrate these constraints through several examples, including decoherence-driven transitions in classical symmetry-broken states, strong-to-weak symmetry breaking criticality in two dimensions, and even transitions in pure quantum states. We also discuss implications for classical nonequilibrium steady states.

*José Giral-Barajas,Paul C. Bressloff*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper combines queuing theory and stochastic resetting search processes in bounded domains to identify parameter regions ensuring queue convergence, revealing a threshold resetting rate that shifts from reducing to expanding convergence regions, with this threshold growing exponentially with server count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address resource management challenges where arrival/consumption are environmentally random, requiring understanding of how stochastic resetting in bounded search domains affects queue stability in systems with limited servers.

Method: Integrates queuing theory with stochastic resetting search models in bounded domains to analyze interactions between search dynamics (expedited/delayed by resetting) and long-term queue resource dynamics.

Result: Identifies parameter regions for queue steady-state convergence; discovers a critical resetting rate threshold where resetting effects reverse from shrinking to expanding convergence regions, with threshold value growing exponentially as servers increase.

Conclusion: Stochastic resetting's ability to improve queue convergence becomes increasingly constrained in larger systems due to exponentially growing threshold requirements, limiting its practical effectiveness for multi-server queue optimization.

Abstract: Proper management of resources whose arrival and consumption are subject to environmental randomness is an intrinsic process in both natural and artificial systems. This phenomenon can be modeled as a queuing process whose arrival distribution is determined by a search process with stochastic resetting. When the queuing system has a limited number of servers and the search process occurs within a bounded domain, the dynamics of expediting or delaying the search through stochastic resetting interact with the long-term dynamics of the number of resources in the queue. We combine results from queuing theory with those from search processes with stochastic resetting in a bounded domain to obtain regions of the parameter space of the search process that ensure convergence of the number of resources in the queue to a steady state. Furthermore, we find a threshold resetting rate at which the effects of stochastic resetting shift from reducing convergence regions to expanding them. Finally, we demonstrate that this threshold value grows exponentially with the number of servers, making it harder for stochastic resetting to improve the convergence of the queueing system.

TL;DR: 三维有限伊辛系统在近临界点呈现平均场行为，但通过有限尺寸标度分析可揭示真实的伊辛临界指数，表明平均场理论在有限系统中有效而在热力学极限下失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统认知：三维伊辛模型在临界点应具有非经典的临界指数（区别于平均场理论），但有限系统的行为可能与热力学极限存在本质差异。

Method: 采用改进的蒙特卡洛模拟方法，直接计算有限尺寸（N个自旋，d=3）伊辛系统的自由能密度f(T,m;L)和共存曲线m_coex(T;L)，分析其尺寸依赖性。

Result: 1. 有限系统在近临界区严格遵循平均场朗道理论（呈现经典临界指数）；
2. 自由能表达为系统线尺寸L的函数时，显现有限尺寸标度形式；
3. 通过标度分析成功提取热力学极限的伊辛临界指数ν, γ, β及临界温度Tc；
4. 平均场有效区域随L增大而缩小，在热力学极限（L→∞）下消失。

Conclusion: 平均场理论在有限系统中具有解释力，但热力学极限的临界现象需由伊辛普适类主导；该研究要求重新审视平均场理论在临界现象中的角色——它描述有限系统的表观行为，而非无限系统的真实临界性质。

Abstract: Universality classes encompass the analogous thermodynamic behavior of unlike physical systems, at different spatial dimensions $d$, in the vicinity of their critical point. Critical exponents define these classes, with the Ising model being the outstanding prototype that elucidates the differences from the mean-field category, believed to be valid above a critical dimension only. Here, in apparent striking contradiction to the Ising universality class, we demonstrate that the critical behavior of a finite Ising system of $N$ spins in $d = 3$ obeys mean-field Landau theory in the vicinity of its critical point, with classical critical exponents. Yet, when expressed in terms of the linear size $L$ of the system, the free energy unveils its proper finite-size scaling form, from which the thermodynamic limit critical temperature $T_c$ and the Ising critical exponents $ν$, $γ$ and $β$ can be identified. We find that the larger the size $L$, the smaller the mean-field region, shrinking to zero in the thermodynamic limit. These conclusions are achieved via the use of an alternative approach to collect data from a Monte Carlo simulation of a three-dimensional Ising model that allows for the evaluation of the free energy per spin $f = f(T,m;L)$ and of the coexistence curve, or spontaneous magnetization at zero magnetic field, $m_{\rm coex} = m(T;L)$ as functions of temperature $T$ and magnetization per spin $m = M/N$. Our results suggest a revision of the role of mean-field theory in the elucidation of critical phenomena.

Traditional PIMC methods for bosonic systems suffer from long autocorrelation times, particularly when measuring observables affected by particle permutations, such as the winding number. To address this issue, we introduce an exchange update scheme that facilitates replica transitions between different interaction regimes, significantly accelerating Monte Carlo dynamics-especially for global observables sensitive to permutation effects. Furthermore, we incorporate Stochastic Potential Switching (SPS) to efficiently decompose interactions, substantially enhancing computational efficiency for long-range interatomic pair potentials such as the Lennard-Jones and Aziz potentials.

Abstract: We study a coupled driven system where two different species of particles, along with some vacancies or holes, move on a landscape whose shape fluctuates with time. The movement of the particles is guided by the local shape of the landscape, and this shape is also affected by the presence of different particle species. When a particle species push the landscape in the same (opposite) direction of its own motion, it is called an aligned (a reverse) bias. Aligned bias promotes ordering while reverse bias destroys it. In absence of vacancies, the system reduces to previously studied LH model with different kinds of ordered and disordered phases which could be explained as a competition or cooperation between aligned bias and reverse bias. This interplay is expected to remain unaffected even when vacancies are present since vacancies do not impart any kind of bias on the landscape. However, we find presence of vacancies effectively weakens the reverse bias and this significantly changes the outcome of the competition between the two bias types. As a result novel ordered phases emerge which were not seen before. We analytically calculate the new phase boundaries within mean field approximation. We show even when aligned bias is weaker than reverse bias, it is possible to find long range order in the system. We discover two new phases where particle species showing weak aligned bias phase separate and the other species with strong reverse bias stays mixed with the vacancies. We call these phases finite current with partial phase separation (FPPS) and vacancy induced phase separation (VIPS). The landscape beneath the phase separated species takes the form of a macroscopic hill or valley in FPPS phase. But in VIPS phase it has the shape like a plateau whose height scales as square root of system size. The landscape in the remaining part of the system is disordered in both these phases.

### [106] [Denoising diffusion networks for normative modeling in neuroimaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04886)
*Luke Whitbread,Lyle J. Palmer,Mark Jenkinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) with two neural backbones (FiLM-MLP and tabular transformer) for unified normative modeling of neuroimaging phenotypes. The method captures multivariate dependencies while maintaining calibration, showing particular advantages in high dimensions (up to 200) on UK Biobank data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neuroimaging normative modeling fits separate models per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards informative multivariate dependence patterns. The authors aim to develop a unified conditional density estimator that preserves these coordinated patterns while remaining compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines.

Method: The authors implement DDPMs as a unified conditional density estimator for tabular IDPs. Two denoiser backbones are proposed: (1) a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned MLP, and (2) SAINT, a tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention. Evaluation includes synthetic benchmarks and UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes (dimensions 2-200), assessing centile calibration, distributional fidelity, multivariate dependence, and memorization.

Result: In low dimensions, DDPMs achieve per-IDP calibration comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structures. In high dimensions (200), the transformer backbone significantly outperforms MLP in calibration and better preserves higher-order dependencies, enabling scalable joint normative models that remain compatible with standard per-IDP analysis pipelines.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based normative modeling provides a practical, scalable approach for generating calibrated multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging, successfully capturing complex dependence structures without sacrificing the interpretability of traditional univariate centile scores.

Abstract: Normative modeling estimates reference distributions of biological measures conditional on covariates, enabling centiles and clinically interpretable deviation scores to be derived. Most neuroimaging pipelines fit one model per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards multivariate dependence that may encode coordinated patterns. We propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as a unified conditional density estimator for tabular IDPs, from which univariate centiles and deviation scores are derived by sampling. We utilise two denoiser backbones: (i) a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned multilayer perceptron (MLP) and (ii) a tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention (SAINT), conditioning covariates through learned embeddings. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark with heteroscedastic and multimodal age effects and on UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes, scaling from dimension of 2 to 200. Our evaluation suite includes centile calibration (absolute centile error, empirical coverage, and the probability integral transform), distributional fidelity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), multivariate dependence diagnostics, and nearest-neighbour memorisation analysis. For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure. At higher dimensions, the transformer backbone remains substantially better calibrated than the MLP and better preserves higher-order dependence, enabling scalable joint normative models that remain compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines. These results support diffusion-based normative modeling as a practical route to calibrated multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging.

Abstract: Uncovering the mechanisms behind "jailbreaks" in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their safety and reliability, yet these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Existing studies predominantly analyze jailbreak prompts by probing latent representations, often overlooking the causal relationships between interpretable prompt features and jailbreak occurrences. In this work, we propose Causal Analyst, a framework that integrates LLMs into data-driven causal discovery to identify the direct causes of jailbreaks and leverage them for both attack and defense. We introduce a comprehensive dataset comprising 35k jailbreak attempts across seven LLMs, systematically constructed from 100 attack templates and 50 harmful queries, annotated with 37 meticulously designed human-readable prompt features. By jointly training LLM-based prompt encoding and GNN-based causal graph learning, we reconstruct causal pathways linking prompt features to jailbreak responses. Our analysis reveals that specific features, such as "Positive Character" and "Number of Task Steps", act as direct causal drivers of jailbreaks. We demonstrate the practical utility of these insights through two applications: (1) a Jailbreaking Enhancer that targets identified causal features to significantly boost attack success rates on public benchmarks, and (2) a Guardrail Advisor that utilizes the learned causal graph to extract true malicious intent from obfuscated queries. Extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons and causal structure validation, confirm the robustness of our causal analysis and its superiority over non-causal approaches. Our results suggest that analyzing jailbreak features from a causal perspective is an effective and interpretable approach for improving LLM reliability.

TL;DR: 一项研究对比了特征转向（Auto Steer）与提示工程在Llama模型上的效果，发现特征转向虽能成功控制目标行为，但会导致MMLU准确率大幅下降（Llama-8B从66%降至46%）和连贯性显著降低，揭示出生成能力与行为控制之间存在根本性权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征转向通过直接操作内部表征来控制LLM行为，被认为比提示工程更有前景，但其在实际应用中的效果及对输出质量的潜在影响仍不明确。

Method: 在Llama-8B和Llama-70B模型上，针对14种行为控制查询（涵盖无害和安全相关行为）和171道MMLU问题，对比评估了Goodfire的Auto Steer方法与提示工程基线，测量指标包括准确率、连贯性和行为控制效果。

Result: Auto Steer成功修改了目标行为（Llama-8B得分3.33 vs 提示工程2.98，Llama-70B得分3.57 vs 3.10），但同时导致性能急剧下降：MMLU准确率分别从66%降至46%（Llama-8B）和87%降至73%（Llama-70B），连贯性从4.62降至2.24和从4.94降至3.89。简单的提示工程实现了最佳整体平衡。

Conclusion: 当前特征转向方法在实际部署中存在局限性，无法在牺牲任务性能的前提下控制行为。更广泛地说，机制性控制方法面临基本的能力-行为权衡，部署前必须进行经验性表征。

Abstract: Feature steering has emerged as a promising approach for controlling LLM behavior through direct manipulation of internal representations, offering advantages over prompt engineering. However, its practical effectiveness in real-world applications remains poorly understood, particularly regarding potential trade-offs with output quality. We show that feature steering methods substantially degrade model performance even when successfully controlling target behaviors, a critical trade-off. Specifically, we evaluate Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries (covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors) on 171 Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control. Our findings show that Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (achieving scores of 3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B and 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B), but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy on the MMLU questions drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively. Simple prompting achieves the best overall balance. These findings highlight limitations of current feature steering methods for practical deployment where task performance cannot be sacrificed. More broadly, our work demonstrates that mechanistic control methods face fundamental capability-behavior trade-offs that must be empirically characterized before deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DCER是一个统一的鲁棒多模态融合框架，通过双阶段压缩和基于能量的重建来解决噪声输入和模态缺失问题，在情感分析基准测试上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合面临两个鲁棒性挑战：噪声输入会降低表示质量，模态缺失会导致预测失败。

Method: 双阶段方法：压缩阶段包括模态内频域变换（音频用小波，视频用DCT）去噪和跨模态瓶颈令牌强制真实融合；基于能量的重建通过梯度下降从学习的能量函数中恢复缺失模态表示，并提供不确定性量化。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI、CMU-MOSEI和CH-SIMS基准测试上实现最优性能，呈现U型鲁棒性模式，在完整和高缺失条件下多模态融合均表现优异，且能量值与预测误差相关性达0.72以上。

Conclusion: 所提出的DCER框架通过压缩和重建方法有效解决了多模态融合中的两个鲁棒性挑战，在多个基准测试上展现出卓越的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion faces two robustness challenges: noisy inputs degrade representation quality, and missing modalities cause prediction failures. We propose DCER, a
  unified framework addressing both challenges through dual-stage compression and energy-based reconstruction. The compression stage operates at two levels:
  within-modality frequency transforms (wavelet for audio, DCT for video) remove noise while preserving task-relevant patterns, and cross-modality bottleneck tokens
  force genuine integration rather than modality-specific shortcuts. For missing modalities, energy-based reconstruction recovers representations via gradient descent
  on a learned energy function, with the final energy providing intrinsic uncertainty quantification (\r{ho} > 0.72 correlation with prediction error). Experiments on
  CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, with a U-shaped robustness pattern favoring multimodal fusion at
  both complete and high-missing conditions. The code will be available on Github.

Conclusion: 成功将物理知识作为归纳偏置融入因果发现，有效处理反馈、循环和非平稳性等挑战，为动态系统因果推断提供了兼具理论保证和实用性的新范式。

Abstract: Causal discovery is often a data-driven paradigm to analyze complex real-world systems. In parallel, physics-based models such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide mechanistic structure for many dynamical processes. Integrating these paradigms potentially allows physical knowledge to act as an inductive bias, improving identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems. However, such integration remains challenging: real dynamical systems often exhibit feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary data trend, while many widely used causal discovery methods are formulated under acyclicity or equilibrium-based assumptions. In this work, we propose an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that leverages partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias. Specifically, we model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term corresponds to unknown causal couplings beyond the prescribed physics. We develop a scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation. Under mild conditions, we establish guarantees to recover the causal graph. Experiments on dynamical systems with diverse causal structures show that our approach improves causal graph recovery and produces more stable, physically consistent estimates than purely data-driven state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: TPC是一种轻量级的方差缩减技术，通过耦合连续时间生成模型中相同概率路径上的配对时间步速度预测，在不改变模型架构或求解器的前提下，显著降低梯度方差，提升采样质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续时间生成模型（如扩散模型、流匹配）在训练时独立处理时间步，导致高估计方差和采样效率低下。现有方法需引入平滑惩罚、轨迹正则化或修改概率路径，增加了复杂性和计算成本。

Method: 提出时间对一致性（TPC）原则，在估计器层面耦合相同轨迹上配对时间步的速度预测，形成二次轨迹耦合正则化，理论证明可降低梯度方差并保持流匹配目标不变，无需修改模型架构、概率路径或求解器。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet多分辨率数据集上，TPC在相同或更低计算成本下获得更低的FID分数，且能无缝集成噪声增强训练、去噪和rectified flow等现代SOTA技术，显著提升采样质量和效率。

Conclusion: TPC是一种通用且轻量的方差缩减方案，为训练连续时间生成模型提供了新的理论见解和实践优势，能够在不增加架构复杂度的前提下实现性能突破。

Abstract: Continuous-time generative models, such as diffusion models, flow matching, and rectified flow, learn time-dependent vector fields but are typically trained with objectives that treat timesteps independently, leading to high estimator variance and inefficient sampling. Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.

### [113] [Learning Where It Matters: Geometric Anchoring for Robust Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04909)
*Youngjae Cho,Jongsuk Kim,Ji-Hoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAPO replaces fixed reference policies in LLM alignment with a dynamic geometric anchor (adversarial perturbation of current policy), enabling adaptive preference reweighting that improves robustness against noise while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DPO suffer from distributional mismatch when fixed reference policies become miscalibrated during training drift, amplifying noise in supervision. Reference-free methods avoid this but allow uncontrolled reward drift, reducing reliability.

Method: Proposes Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO): 1) Uses a dynamic anchor policy created via adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within small radius; 2) Introduces Anchor Gap (reward difference between policy and anchor) as adaptive weight for preference pairs; 3) Optimizes logistic objective weighted by this gap to downweight brittle instances.

Result: GAPO consistently enhances robustness across diverse noise conditions while matching or exceeding standard DPO performance on LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic geometric anchoring effectively mitigates policy drift issues in preference optimization, providing noise-resistant alignment without sacrificing standard task performance through sensitivity-aware reweighting.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and related methods align large language models from pairwise preferences by regularizing updates against a fixed reference policy. As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有级联架构存在错误累积、高延迟、实时性差等问题，且缺乏对话上下文导致表情僵硬，无法体现情感深度。

Method: 提出统一框架的A$^2$-LLM模型，并引入高质量多模态数据集FLAME-QA对齐语义意图与表情动态。

Result: 系统在保持实时效率（500ms延迟，0.7 RTF）的同时实现卓越的情感表现力。

Conclusion: 端到端架构有效解决了级联系统缺陷，为下一代人机交互提供了更具表现力的对话数字人解决方案。

Abstract: Developing expressive and responsive conversational digital humans is a cornerstone of next-generation human-computer interaction. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced dialogue capabilities, most current systems still rely on cascaded architectures that connect independent modules. These pipelines are often plagued by accumulated errors, high latency, and poor real-time performance. Lacking access to the underlying conversational context, these pipelines inherently prioritize rigid lip-sync over emotional depth. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar large language model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion within a unified framework. To facilitate training, we introduce FLAME-QA, a high-quality multimodal dataset designed to align semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics within a QA format. By leveraging deep semantic understanding, A$^2$-LLM generates emotionally rich facial movements beyond simple lip-synchronization. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves superior emotional expressiveness while maintaining real-time efficiency (500 ms latency, 0.7 RTF).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLAY是一种基于Yat核的球面线性化注意力机制，将查询和键约束到单位球面，在保持线性时间/内存复杂度的同时，性能几乎与标准softmax注意力相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax注意力存在二次复杂度瓶颈，而现有线性时间注意力机制（如Performers、Cosformers）存在性能损失，本文旨在实现线性复杂度的同时尽可能接近softmax性能。

Method: 提出SLAY（球面Yat核线性化注意力）：基于E-Product/Yat核松弛形式，将查询和键约束到单位球面使注意力仅依赖角度对齐，利用Bernstein定理表达为非负多项式-指数核混合，推导严格正随机特征近似实现O(L)线性时间注意力。

Result: SLAY性能与标准softmax注意力几乎不可区分，保持线性时间/内存复杂度，持续优于Performers和Cosformers等现有方法。

Conclusion: SLAY是迄今最接近softmax注意力的线性时间近似，使Transformer能够在无性能损失下实现可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a new class of linear-time attention mechanisms based on a relaxed and computationally efficient formulation of the recently introduced E-Product, often referred to as the Yat-kernel (Bouhsine, 2025). The resulting interactions are geometry-aware and inspired by inverse-square interactions in physics. Our method, Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat Kernels (SLAY), constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere so that attention depends only on angular alignment. Using Bernstein's theorem, we express the spherical Yat-kernel as a nonnegative mixture of polynomial-exponential product kernels and derive a strictly positive random-feature approximation enabling linear-time O(L) attention. We establish positive definiteness and boundedness on the sphere and show that the estimator yields well-defined, nonnegative attention scores. Empirically, SLAY achieves performance that is nearly indistinguishable from standard softmax attention while retaining linear time and memory scaling, and consistently outperforms prior linear-time attention mechanisms such as Performers and Cosformers. To the best of our knowledge, SLAY represents the closest linear-time approximation to softmax attention reported to date, enabling scalable Transformers without the typical performance trade-offs of attention linearization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量分解和异常检测方法无法有效处理包含分类属性（如IP地址）和连续属性（如数据包长度）的异质张量流，通常需要离散化或错误假设分布，导致数据失真和性能下降。同时，现有方法离散化时间戳，无法捕捉时序动态（如趋势和异常事件），难以检测组级异常（如DoS攻击）。

Conclusion: HeteroComp有效解决了现有方法的局限性，通过高斯过程直接建模异质数据分布和时序动态，为异构张量流提供了准确的组异常检测能力，并具备计算效率优势。

Abstract: Analysis and anomaly detection in event tensor streams consisting of timestamps and multiple attributes - such as communication logs(time, IP address, packet length)- are essential tasks in data mining. While existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods provide useful insights, they face the following two limitations. (i) They cannot handle heterogeneous tensor streams, which comprises both categorical attributes(e.g., IP address) and continuous attributes(e.g., packet length). They typically require either discretizing continuous attributes or treating categorical attributes as continuous, both of which distort the underlying statistical properties of the data.Furthermore, incorrect assumptions about the distribution family of continuous attributes often degrade the model's performance. (ii) They discretize timestamps, failing to track the temporal dynamics of streams(e.g., trends, abnormal events), which makes them ineffective for detecting anomalies at the group level, referred to as 'group anomalies' (e.g, DoS attacks). To address these challenges, we propose HeteroComp, a method for continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into 'components' representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics, and detecting group anomalies. Our method employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes, and temporal dynamics, which directly estimate probability densities from data. Extracted components give concise but effective summarization, enabling accurate group anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that HeteroComp outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for group anomaly detection accuracy, and its computational time does not depend on the data stream length.

### [117] [Simulated Adoption: Decoupling Magnitude and Direction in LLM In-Context Conflict Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04918)
*Long Zhang,Fangwei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates why LLMs prioritize conflicting in-context information over their parametric memory. Through geometric analysis of residual streams across three model architectures, the authors discover that compliance is driven by "Orthogonal Interference" - where conflicting contexts rotate hidden states via quasi-orthogonal steering vectors rather than diluting signal magnitude. This challenges existing detection methods and reveals a geometric displacement mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs frequently exhibit sycophancy/compliance by prioritizing conflicting in-context information over pre-existing parametric memory, but the mechanistic origin remains unclear - specifically whether this suppression occurs through signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration in the residual stream.

Method: Conducted layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components to examine the geometric mechanisms.

Result: Rejected the "Manifold Dilution" hypothesis as two of three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite significant performance degradation. Instead, found "Orthogonal Interference" - where conflicting contexts inject quasi-orthogonal steering vectors that rotate hidden state representations away from ground-truth directions.

Conclusion: Models employ geometric displacement rather than magnitude suppression to bypass correct unembedding vectors. This challenges scalar confidence metrics for detecting hallucinations and highlights the need for vectorial monitoring to distinguish genuine knowledge integration from superficial in-context mimicry.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently prioritize conflicting in-context information over pre-existing parametric memory, a phenomenon often termed sycophancy or compliance. However, the mechanistic realization of this behavior remains obscure, specifically how the model resolves these knowledge conflicts through compliance, and whether this suppression arises from signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration within the residual stream. To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components. Our empirical results reject the universality of the "Manifold Dilution" hypothesis, as two of the three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite exhibiting significant performance degradation on factual queries. Instead, we observed that compliance is consistently characterized by "Orthogonal Interference," where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation. This suggests that models do not "unlearn" or suppress the magnitude of internal truths but rather employ a mechanism of geometric displacement to bypass the correct unembedding vector, effectively simulating adoption while preserving the original structural magnitude. These findings challenge scalar confidence metrics for detecting hallucinations and underscore the necessity of vectorial monitoring to distinguish between genuine knowledge integration and superficial in-context mimicry.

Conclusion: 渐进式压缩是一种有效的大模型瘦身方案，在数学推理和代码生成等多种任务上证明其普适性，为资源受限场景部署大模型提供了可行路径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, but their substantial size often demands significant computational resources. To reduce resource consumption and accelerate inference, it is essential to eliminate redundant parameters without compromising performance. However, conventional pruning methods that directly remove such parameters often lead to a dramatic drop in model performance in reasoning tasks, and require extensive post-training to recover the lost capabilities. In this work, we propose a gradual compacting method that divides the compression process into multiple fine-grained iterations, applying a Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) at each stage to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance with finetuning. This iterative approach-reminiscent of the "boiling frog" effect-enables the model to be progressively compressed without abrupt performance loss. Experimental results show that PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, while maintaining performance comparable to the original model on reasoning tasks. Moreover, PTL is flexible and can be applied to various pruning strategies, such as neuron pruning and layer pruning, as well as different post-training methods, including continual pre-training and reinforcement learning. Additionally, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of PTL on a variety of tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, such as code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal machine learning, mimicking the human brain's ability to integrate various modalities has seen rapid growth. Most previous multimodal models are trained on perfectly paired multimodal input to reach optimal performance. In real-world deployments, however, the presence of modality is highly variable and unpredictable, causing the pre-trained models in suffering significant performance drops and fail to remain robust with dynamic missing modalities circumstances. In this paper, we present a novel Cyclic INformative Learning framework (CyIN) to bridge the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning. Specifically, we firstly build an informative latent space by adopting token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among various modalities. Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model. Extensive experiments on 4 multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both complete and diverse incomplete scenarios.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogates for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their ability to handle general, highly variable boundary conditions (BCs) remains limited. Existing approaches often fail when the solution operator exhibits strong sensitivity to boundary forcings. We propose a general framework for conditioning neural operators on complex non-homogeneous BCs through function extensions. Our key idea is to map boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions defined over the entire spatial domain, enabling any standard operator learning architecture to consume boundary information. The resulting operator, coupled with an arbitrary domain-to-domain neural operator, can learn rich dependencies on complex BCs and input domain functions at the same time. To benchmark this setting, we construct 18 challenging datasets spanning Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity problems, with highly variable, mixed-type, component-wise, and multi-segment BCs on diverse geometries. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming baselines by large margins, while requiring no hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Overall, our results demonstrate that learning boundary-to-domain extensions is an effective and practical strategy for imposing complex BCs in existing neural operator frameworks, enabling accurate and robust scientific machine learning models for a broader range of PDE-governed problems.

It proposes Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method that enhances Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) confidence with input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is unreliable, using two learned heads for residual risk prediction and confidence gating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AVQA models achieve high accuracy, their capability to recognize uncertainty and abstain from answering when likely wrong remains underexplored, limiting reliability in real-world applications where incorrect answers are more costly than abstention.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR) that recognizes MSP is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration (rare in deep networks). It retains MSP as primary signal but adds two learned heads: (1) a Residual Risk Head to predict low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP misses, and (2) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness for input-adaptive corrections.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ACR consistently outperforms existing methods across in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and data bias settings on three different AVQA architectures.

Conclusion: ACR establishes a solid foundation for R-AVQA by effectively balancing answer confidence with abstention mechanisms, improving model reliability through intelligent correction of overconfident predictions.

Abstract: We present a formal problem formulation for \textit{Reliable} Audio-Visual Question Answering ($\mathcal{R}$-AVQA), where we prefer abstention over answering incorrectly. While recent AVQA models have high accuracy, their ability to identify when they are likely wrong and their consequent abstention from answering remain underexplored areas of research. To fill this gap, we explore several approaches and then propose Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method to further enhance the performance of $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA. Our key insight is that the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration, a condition usually not met in deep neural networks, particularly in multimodal models. Instead of replacing MSP, our ACR maintains it as a primary confidence signal and applies input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is deemed unreliable. ACR introduces two learned heads: i) a Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP does not capture, and ii) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness. Our experiments and theoretical analysis show that ACR consistently outperforms existing methods on in- and out-of-disrtibution, and data bias settings across three different AVQA architectures, establishing a solid foundation for $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes STIR, a dynamic latent trajectory control framework that internalizes chain-of-thought reasoning to improve efficiency and accuracy while reducing token generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activation steering methods use static control vectors that cannot adapt to the evolving nature of complex reasoning tasks, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: 1) harvesting latent reasoning successes to create steering primitives, 2) building a compact tool library, and 3) dynamically injecting context-specific interventions via gating mechanisms.

Result: Improves average accuracy by 1.9%-7.5% across six benchmarks and four models while reducing token consumption by up to 35% compared to standard decoding.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that explicit chain-of-thought benefits can be achieved through dynamic latent control, internalizing reasoning to bypass explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

Abstract: The internalization of chain-of-thought processes into hidden states has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm for scaling test-time compute. However, existing activation steering methods rely on static control vectors that fail to adapt to the non-stationary evolution of complex reasoning tasks. To address this limitation, we propose STIR (Self-Distilled Tools for Internal Reasoning), a framework that reformulates reasoning enhancement as a dynamic latent trajectory control problem. STIR introduces a synergistic three-stage pipeline: (1) differential intrinsic action induction harvests latent reasoning successes to crystallize steering primitives; (2) sparse control basis construction curates a compact, geometrically diverse tool library; and (3) value-modulated trajectory intervention dynamically injects context-specific impulses via anchor-based gating. Extensive experiments on six arithmetic and logical benchmarks across four representative models demonstrate that STIR improves average accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% while reducing average token consumption by up to 35% compared to vanilla decoding. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of explicit chain-of-thought can be realized through dynamic latent trajectory control, internalizing the reasoning process to bypass the explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Euphonium: A novel framework that uses process reward gradient guided dynamics via SDE formulation to improve exploration efficiency in online RL for flow matching models, achieving better alignment and 1.66x faster convergence in text-to-video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current online RL approaches for aligning flow matching models suffer from inefficient exploration due to reliance on undirected stochasticity and sparse outcome rewards, causing data inefficiency and slow optimization.

Method: Proposes Euphonium which formulates sampling as a Stochastic Differential Equation incorporating Process Reward Model gradients into flow drift for dense, step-by-step steering. Includes a distillation objective to internalize guidance and uses Dual-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization combining latent process rewards with pixel-level outcome rewards.

Result: Achieves better alignment compared to existing methods while accelerating training convergence by 1.66x on text-to-video generation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses exploration inefficiency in flow matching alignment, providing theoretical generality over existing methods and practical improvements in both performance and training efficiency.

Abstract: While online Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning flow matching models with human preferences, current approaches are hindered by inefficient exploration during training rollouts. Relying on undirected stochasticity and sparse outcome rewards, these methods struggle to discover high-reward samples, resulting in data-inefficient and slow optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Euphonium, a novel framework that steers generation via process reward gradient guided dynamics. Our key insight is to formulate the sampling process as a theoretically principled Stochastic Differential Equation that explicitly incorporates the gradient of a Process Reward Model into the flow drift. This design enables dense, step-by-step steering toward high-reward regions, advancing beyond the unguided exploration in prior works, and theoretically encompasses existing sampling methods (e.g., Flow-GRPO, DanceGRPO) as special cases. We further derive a distillation objective that internalizes the guidance signal into the flow network, eliminating inference-time dependency on the reward model. We instantiate this framework with a Dual-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, combining latent process rewards for efficient credit assignment with pixel-level outcome rewards for final visual fidelity. Experiments on text-to-video generation show that Euphonium achieves better alignment compared to existing methods while accelerating training convergence by 1.66x.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TurboBoA is a new backpropagation-free post-training quantization algorithm that accelerates BoA by over 3x while maintaining or improving accuracy for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPTQ's layer-wise independence assumption causes severe accuracy drops in low-bit quantization, while BoA's inter-layer dependency modeling is computationally expensive due to sequential quantization across all out-channels, creating a need for an efficient yet accurate PTQ method.

Method: TurboBoA introduces three innovations: (1) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with a closed-form error compensation rule to eliminate sequential bottlenecks; (2) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (3) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates.

Result: The algorithm achieves more than a three-fold speedup over BoA, consistently improves accuracy, and delivers state-of-the-art results in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization when combined with outlier suppression techniques.

Conclusion: TurboBoA successfully bridges the efficiency-accuracy gap in PTQ, providing a practical solution for quantizing billion-scale LLMs with significantly reduced GPU hours while preserving model performance.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the importance of post-training quantization (PTQ) for reducing memory and computation costs. Among PTQ methods, GPTQ has gained significant attention for its efficiency, enabling billion-scale LLMs to be quantized within a few GPU hours. However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes. Recently, BoA improved upon GPTQ by incorporating inter-layer dependencies within attention modules, but its reliance on sequential quantization across all out-channels makes it substantially less efficient. In this paper, we propose TurboBoA, a new backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that preserves the accuracy benefits of BoA while significantly accelerating the process. The proposed TurboBoA introduces three key innovations: (i) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with a closed-form error compensation rule, which reduces sequential bottlenecks and yields more than a three-fold speedup; (ii) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (iii) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TurboBoA delivers substantial acceleration over BoA while consistently improving accuracy. When combined with outlier suppression techniques, it achieves state-of-the-art results in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization.

Result: 揭示后期层表征形成结构化几何码：角度组织参数化预测分布相似性，表征范数编码不决定预测的上下文信息，实现选择性因果控制。

Conclusion: 建立了大语言模型中上下文转化为预测的机制性-几何学理论框架。

Abstract: We show that decoder-only large language models exhibit a depth-wise transition from context-processing to prediction-forming phases of computation accompanied by a reorganization of representational geometry. Using a unified framework combining geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention, we demonstrate that late-layer representations implement a structured geometric code that enables selective causal control over token prediction. Specifically, angular organization of the representation geometry parametrizes prediction distributional similarity, while representation norms encode context-specific information that does not determine prediction. Together, these results provide a mechanistic-geometric account of the dynamics of transforming context into predictions in LLMs.

Conclusion: 全程保持双曲空间处理对GCD任务至关重要，双曲K-Means能有效捕捉数据层次结构，提升模型对未见类别的泛化能力和聚类鲁棒性，为开放世界分类提供新范式。

Abstract: Hyperbolic representation learning has been widely used to extract implicit hierarchies within data, and recently it has found its way to the open-world classification task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). However, prior hyperbolic GCD methods only use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning and transform back to Euclidean geometry when clustering. We hypothesize this is suboptimal. Therefore, we present Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry, and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm. We test our model on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that HC-GCD is on par with the previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method. Furthermore, we show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. We carry out ablation studies showing that clipping the norm of the Euclidean embeddings leads to decreased accuracy in clustering unseen classes, and increased accuracy for seen classes, while the overall accuracy is dataset dependent. We also show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to more consistent clusters when varying the label granularity.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tool for the neural surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. However, scaling these solvers to industrial-scale geometries with over $10^8$ cells remains a fundamental challenge due to the prohibitive memory complexity of processing high-resolution meshes. We present Transolver-3, a new member of the Transolver family as a highly scalable framework designed for high-fidelity physics simulations. To bridge the gap between limited GPU capacity and the resolution requirements of complex engineering tasks, we introduce two key architectural optimizations: faster slice and deslice by exploiting matrix multiplication associative property and geometry slice tiling to partition the computation of physical states. Combined with an amortized training strategy by learning on random subsets of original high-resolution meshes and a physical state caching technique during inference, Transolver-3 enables high-fidelity field prediction on industrial-scale meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Transolver-3 is capable of handling meshes with over 160 million cells, achieving impressive performance across three challenging simulation benchmarks, including aircraft and automotive design tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闭源前沿模型通常隐藏内部推理而仅暴露动作轨迹，导致标准蒸馏方法失效。如何在不泄露推理过程的情况下，将训练时的特权信息有效迁移至推理时策略，是该研究的核心挑战。

Method: π-Distill采用联合教师-学生框架，在同一模型中同时训练PI条件化教师和无条件学生；OPSD基于反向KL惩罚的强化学习方法，实现学生与PI条件化教师的对齐。两种方法均仅依赖动作层面的特权信息。

Result: π-Distill和OPSD能利用动作级PI有效蒸馏前沿智能体；在多项智能体基准、模型和PI形式下，π-Distill及特定场景的OPSD超越需完整思维链监督的行业标准实践。

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了PI迁移难题，π-Distill表现优异且OPSD在特定条件下具备竞争力，表明即使缺乏可观测推理过程，也能实现高效的特权信息学习。

Abstract: Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce π-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that π-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on π-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical model calibration faces challenges from computational expense and parameter uncertainties, particularly in complex systems like plasma-surface interactions where kinetic simulations are costly and surface reactivity parameters are uncertain.

Method: The authors developed a stochastic hierarchical optimization framework inspired by Sloppy Model theory, employing a reduced Hessian approximation to identify stiff parameter subspaces, combined with a probabilistic formulation to derive a principled loss function from observed data.

Result: The method efficiently navigates highly anisotropic parameter landscapes with minimal simulation queries and consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency when applied to plasma-surface interaction modeling.

Conclusion: This approach provides a general, scalable tool for optimizing complex reaction system models, with potential applications extending from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.

Abstract: This work introduces a stochastic hierarchical optimization framework inspired by Sloppy Model theory for the efficient calibration of physical models. Central to this method is the use of a reduced Hessian approximation, which identifies and targets the stiff parameter subspace using minimal simulation queries. This strategy enables efficient navigation of highly anisotropic landscapes, avoiding the computational burden of exhaustive sampling. To ensure rigorous inference, we integrate this approach with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data. We validate the framework by applying it to the problem of plasma-surface interactions, where accurate modelling is strictly limited by uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and the computational cost of kinetic simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency. This approach offers a general and scalable tool for optimizing models of complex reaction systems, ranging from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal theoretical guarantees. In realistic simulations for heart transplant allocation, the policy closely matches the performance of the omniscient benchmark.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges the gap between data-driven heuristics and pessimistic theoretical lower bounds, providing rigorous justification for prior clustering-based approaches in organ allocation.

Abstract: Online matching has been a mainstay in domains such as Internet advertising and organ allocation, but practical algorithms often lack strong theoretical guarantees. We take an important step toward addressing this by developing new online matching algorithms based on a coarsening approach. Although coarsening typically implies a loss of granularity, we show that, to the contrary, aggregating offline nodes into capacitated clusters can yield near-optimal theoretical guarantees. We apply our methodology to heart transplant allocation to develop theoretically grounded policies based on structural properties of historical data. In realistic simulations, our policy closely matches the performance of the omniscient benchmark.

Abstract: The allocation of scarce donor organs constitutes one of the most consequential algorithmic challenges in healthcare. While the field is rapidly transitioning from rigid, rule-based systems to machine learning and data-driven optimization, we argue that current approaches often overlook a fundamental barrier: incentives. In this position paper, we highlight that organ allocation is not merely a static optimization problem, but rather a complex game involving transplant centers, clinicians, and regulators. Focusing on US adult heart transplant allocation, we identify critical incentive misalignments across the decision-making pipeline, and present data showing that they are having adverse consequences today. Our main position is that the next generation of allocation policies should be incentive aware. We outline a research agenda for the machine learning community, calling for the integration of mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice to ensure robustness, efficiency, and fairness in the face of strategic behavior from the various constituent groups.

Conclusion: EntRGi有效解决了离散扩散语言模型的奖励引导问题，为离散生成模型的测试时适应提供了新方案。

Abstract: Reward guidance has been applied to great success in the test-time adaptation of continuous diffusion models; it updates each denoising step using the gradients from a downstream reward model. We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model. We empirically validate our approach on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法在效果和效率上显著优于现有方案，为LLM隐私保护提供了新方向。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks with only a small set of examples at inference time, thereby avoiding task-specific fine-tuning. However, in-context examples may contain privacy-sensitive information that should not be revealed through model outputs. Existing differential privacy (DP) approaches to ICL are either computationally expensive or rely on heuristics with limited effectiveness, including context oversampling, synthetic data generation, or unnecessary thresholding. We reformulate private ICL through the lens of a Product-of-Experts model. This gives a theoretically grounded framework, and the algorithm can be trivially parallelized. We evaluate our method across five datasets in text classification, math, and vision-language. We find that our method improves accuracy by more than 30 percentage points on average compared to prior DP-ICL methods, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

Motivation: To formulate fundamental physical-like laws governing learning dynamics and leverage these principles to develop more robust lifelong ensemble learning methods that can defend against transfer-based adversarial attacks.

Method: Formulated theoretical framework based on conservation law and entropy decrease in learning dynamics; introduced an entropy-based lifelong ensemble learning method; constructed an immunization mechanism evaluated on CIFAR-10 against transfer-based adversarial attacks.

Result: The proposed logifold method achieved higher accuracy than a naive ensemble baseline across most test cases, with particularly significant improvements observed under conditions of strong adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: Entropy-based lifelong ensemble learning grounded in fundamental learning dynamics laws provides an effective approach for building robust defenses against adversarial attacks, especially in challenging high-perturbation scenarios.

Abstract: We formulate the fundamental laws governing learning dynamics, namely the conservation law and the decrease of total entropy. Within this framework, we introduce an entropy-based lifelong ensemble learning method. We evaluate its effectiveness by constructing an immunization mechanism to defend against transfer-based adversarial attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Compared with a naive ensemble formed by simply averaging models specialized on clean and adversarial samples, the resulting logifold achieves higher accuracy in most test cases, with particularly large gains under strong perturbations.

Abstract: Planning with a learned model remains a key challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). In decision-time planning, state representations are critical as they must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. In this paper, we show that the Laplacian representation provides an effective latent space for planning by capturing state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances and naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, also mitigating the compounding errors that arise over long prediction horizons. Building on these properties, we introduce ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm, and demonstrate that it outperforms commonly used baselines on a selection of offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, a benchmark previously dominated by model-free methods.

Abstract: Learning meaningful causal representations from observations has emerged as a crucial task for facilitating machine learning applications and driving scientific discoveries in fields such as climate science, biology, and physics. This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.

### [138] [Feedback Control for Multi-Objective Graph Self-Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05036)
*Karish Grover,Theodore Vasiloudis,Han Xie,Sixing Lu,Xiang Song,Christos Faloutsos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper solves the problem of conflicting objectives in graph self-supervised learning by introducing ControlG, a control-theory framework that coordinates multiple learning tasks through temporal allocation (when to train each task) instead of per-update mixing (how to weight them), eliminating three common failure modes while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-pretext graph SSL methods suffer from objective interference and instability because they force every parameter update to be a compromise between conflicting tasks, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives).

Method: Proposes ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective coordination as a temporal allocation problem. It estimates per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, uses a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner to set target budgets, and schedules training via a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller.

Result: Across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in graph self-supervised learning, while generating auditable training schedules that reveal which objectives were most influential during learning.

Conclusion: Temporal allocation of optimization budget (deciding when to train each objective) is fundamentally superior to per-update mixing (deciding how to weight them) for coordinating multi-task graph SSL, as it avoids destructive interference between objectives and produces more stable, effective learning.

Abstract: Can multi-task self-supervised learning on graphs be coordinated without the usual tug-of-war between objectives? Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a growing toolbox of pretext objectives: mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning; yet combining them reliably remains a challenge due to objective interference and training instability. Most multi-pretext pipelines use per-update mixing, forcing every parameter update to be a compromise, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). We argue that coordination is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem: deciding when each objective receives optimization budget, not merely how to weigh them. We introduce ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation by estimating per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, planning target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and scheduling with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, while producing an auditable schedule that reveals which objectives drove learning.

*Songyuan Zhang,Oswin So,H. M. Sabbir Ahmad,Eric Yang Yu,Matthew Cleaveland,Mitchell Black,Chuchu Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReFORM is an offline RL method that uses flow policies with support constraints to prevent out-of-distribution errors while maintaining expressiveness, achieving superior performance on 40 OGBench tasks with consistent hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL faces two key challenges: 1) OOD errors when policies deviate from the training dataset distribution, and 2) difficulty in representing multimodal optimal policies. Prior methods either constrain policy improvement through statistical distance penalties or use expressive diffusion/flow policies without clear OOD avoidance mechanisms.

Method: ReFORM learns a behavior cloning flow policy with bounded source distribution to capture the action distribution support, then optimizes a reflected flow that injects bounded noise while maintaining the support constraint, enabling expressive policy representation without OOD errors.

Result: On 40 challenging OGBench tasks with varying dataset quality and constant hyperparameters, ReFORM outperforms all baseline methods with hand-tuned hyperparameters on performance profile curves.

Conclusion: The support constraint approach effectively prevents OOD errors while preserving the expressiveness of flow-based policies, demonstrating that ReFORM successfully addresses key limitations of prior offline RL methods across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn the optimal policy from a fixed dataset generated by behavior policies without additional environment interactions. One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance. Across 40 challenging tasks from the OGBench benchmark with datasets of varying quality and using a constant set of hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on the performance profile curves.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于伽辽金离散化和TensorGalerkin的统一框架，用于求解、优化和学习具有变分结构的偏微分方程，在2D/3D基准测试中显著提升计算效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对具有变分结构的偏微分方程，缺乏统一且高效计算框架的问题，特别是需要同时支持数值模拟、约束优化和物理信息学习三大应用，且需实现GPU加速以适应现代计算需求。

Method: 采用变分形式的伽辽金离散化，核心是TensorGalerkin框架：在Python层面对单元操作进行张量化映射，再通过稀疏矩阵乘法在网格诱导的稀疏图上进行全局规约，实现GPU兼容的刚度矩阵和载荷向量高效组装。

Result: 在2D/3D椭圆、抛物和双曲型偏微分方程的非结构网格测试中，该框架在三种下游应用（数值求解、可微优化、物理信息算子学习）中均相比多种基线方法获得显著的计算效率和精度提升。

Conclusion: 该框架成功统一了偏微分方程的求解、优化和学习任务，TensorGalerkin的高性能组装是其关键优势，为复杂PDEs问题提供了通用且高效的计算工具。

Abstract: We present a unified algorithmic framework for the numerical solution, constrained optimization, and physics-informed learning of PDEs with a variational structure. Our framework is based on a Galerkin discretization of the underlying variational forms, and its high efficiency stems from a novel highly-optimized and GPU-compliant TensorGalerkin framework for linear system assembly (stiffness matrices and load vectors). TensorGalerkin operates by tensorizing element-wise operations within a Python-level Map stage and then performs global reduction with a sparse matrix multiplication that performs message passing on the mesh-induced sparsity graph. It can be seamlessly employed downstream as i) a highly-efficient numerical PDEs solver, ii) an end-to-end differentiable framework for PDE-constrained optimization, and iii) a physics-informed operator learning algorithm for PDEs. With multiple benchmarks, including 2D and 3D elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on unstructured meshes, we demonstrate that the proposed framework provides significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains over a variety of baselines in all the targeted downstream applications.

Conclusion: 该框架能有效响应天气变化并提供可靠的安全车速建议，具备实际部署潜力，可提升交通安全并减少天气相关事故

Abstract: Inclement weather conditions can significantly impact driver visibility and tire-road surface friction, requiring adjusted safe driving speeds to reduce crash risk. This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types. The model's ability to respond to changing weather conditions and generalize across road segments shows promise for real-world deployment, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes.

TL;DR: 本文提出解释可靠性指数(ERI)，通过四个可靠性公理量化机器学习模型解释的稳定性，揭示SHAP、IG等流行方法在真实部署条件下存在严重的不稳定性问题，并提供形式化理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域(能源、医疗、金融、自动驾驶)中，复杂机器学习模型的决策需要可解释性。然而，现有方法如SHAP和积分梯度(IG)的解释在微小输入扰动、特征相关性和模型更新等非对抗性变化下稳定性不足，这种可变性削弱了模型可信度，因为可靠的解释应在等效输入表示和性能保持的模型变化下保持一致。

Method: 提出解释可靠性指数(ERI)指标族，基于四个公理：对小输入扰动的鲁棒性、特征冗余下的一致性、模型演化中的平滑性、对轻度分布偏移的弹性。为每个公理推导Lipschitz型边界和时序稳定性等理论保证。特别地，提出针对序列模型的ERI-T度量，并构建ERI-Bench基准测试集，在合成和真实数据集上系统压力测试解释可靠性。

Result: 实验结果显示，流行解释方法存在普遍可靠性缺陷，其解释在真实部署条件下表现出显著不稳定性。这证明了当前解释方法在实际应用中可能存在重大信任风险。

Conclusion: ERI通过暴露和量化解释不稳定性，为评估解释可靠性提供了原则性框架，支持开发更可信的机器学习系统，推动可信AI的发展。

Abstract: In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.

Motivation: 在策略分类场景下，个体为影响机器学习决策会修改自身特征，此设置中的群体公平性已受广泛关注，但个体公平性仍未被充分探索。

Method: 分析基于阈值的分类器，证明确定性阈值违反个体公平性；进而提出随机化分类器，通过建立个体公平性条件并利用线性规划求解最优且满足个体公平性的分类器。

Result: 在特定条件下，随机化分类器可确保个体公平性，且该方法可扩展至群体公平性概念。在真实数据集上的实验证实，该方法有效减轻了不公平性并改善了公平性-准确率权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的随机化分类器方法能有效解决策略分类中的个体公平性问题，同时提升公平性-准确率权衡，并具有向群体公平性扩展的能力。

Abstract: Strategic classification, where individuals modify their features to influence machine learning (ML) decisions, presents critical fairness challenges. While group fairness in this setting has been widely studied, individual fairness remains underexplored. We analyze threshold-based classifiers and prove that deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness. Then, we investigate the possibility of using a randomized classifier to achieve individual fairness. We introduce conditions under which a randomized classifier ensures individual fairness and leverage these conditions to find an optimal and individually fair randomized classifier through a linear programming problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be extended to group fairness notions. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our method effectively mitigates unfairness and improves the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

*Parsa Vares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoDiscover adapts active learning for systematic literature reviews by combining heterogeneous graph attention networks with discounted Thompson sampling to dynamically optimize document screening, significantly improving efficiency especially in cold-start scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual screening in SLRs is a bottleneck due to growing scientific output, low prevalence of relevant studies, and scarce expert decisions. Traditional active learning uses static query strategies that cannot adapt over time or leverage literature network structure.

Method: Reframes active learning as online decision-making using a heterogeneous graph of documents/authors/metadata. A HAN learns node representations while a DTS agent dynamically manages query strategies, balancing exploration-exploitation with real-time human labels under non-stationary dynamics.

Result: Achieves higher screening efficiency than static baselines on the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, effectively mitigates cold-start problems from minimal initial labels, and includes TS-Insight, an open-source dashboard for agent decision interpretability.

Conclusion: AutoDiscover accelerates SLR screening by adaptively leveraging literature network structure and dynamically optimizing query strategies, offering a superior solution for evidence-based research under scarce expert resources.

Abstract: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are fundamental to evidence-based research, but manual screening is an increasing bottleneck as scientific output grows. Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies.

Abstract: In a probabilistic reformulation of a combinatorial problem, we often face an optimization over a hypercube, which corresponds to the Bernoulli probability parameter for each binary variable in the primal problem. The combinatorial nature suggests that an exact gradient computation requires multiple queries. We propose a stochastic gradient that is unbiased and requires only a single query of the combinatorial function. This method encompasses a well-established REINFORCE (through an importance sampling), as well as including a class of new stochastic gradients.

TL;DR: Proposing RRD, a recursive rubric refinement framework that decomposes coarse criteria and filters redundancy to improve LLM judge accuracy and reinforcement fine-tuning rewards


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation rubrics suffer from poor coverage, dimension conflation, misalignment, and redundancy, which degrade judge accuracy and produce weak rewards for reinforcement fine-tuning

Method: RRD uses a recursive decompose-filter cycle: decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained discriminative criteria, then filters misaligned/redundant ones with correlation-aware weighting to create informative, comprehensive, non-redundant rubric sets

Result: Improves judge accuracy by up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench; boosts RFT reward signals by 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus baselines, with gains transferring to downstream benchmarks

Conclusion: Recursive rubric refinement provides a scalable, interpretable foundation for LLM judging and reward modeling in open-ended domains

Abstract: Recently, rubrics have been used to guide LLM judges in capturing subjective, nuanced, multi-dimensional human preferences, and have been extended from evaluation to reward signals for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, rubric generation remains hard to control: rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, misalign preference direction, and contain redundant or highly correlated criteria, degrading judge accuracy and producing suboptimal rewards during RFT. We propose RRD, a principled framework for rubric refinement built on a recursive decompose-filter cycle. RRD decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained, discriminative criteria, expanding coverage while sharpening separation between responses. A complementary filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant rubrics, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representing highly correlated criteria, yielding rubric sets that are informative, comprehensive, and non-redundant. Empirically, RRD delivers large, consistent gains across both evaluation and training: it improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE for both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B judges, achieving top performance in all settings with up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench. When used as the reward source for RFT on WildChat, it yields substantially stronger and more stable learning signals, boosting reward by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus 10-20% for prior rubric baselines, with gains that transfer to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench. Overall, RRD establishes recursive rubric refinement as a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM judging and reward modeling in open-ended domains.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning on tabular data relies on complex data preparation pipelines for prediction, data integration, augmentation, and debugging. Designing these pipelines requires substantial domain expertise and engineering effort, motivating the question of how large language models (LLMs) can support tabular ML through code synthesis. We introduce SemPipes, a novel declarative programming model that integrates LLM-powered semantic data operators into tabular ML pipelines. Semantic operators specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. This design enables the automatic optimization of data operations in a pipeline via LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search. We evaluate SemPipes across diverse tabular ML tasks and show that semantic operators substantially improve end-to-end predictive performance for both expert-designed and agent-generated pipelines, while reducing pipeline complexity. We implement SemPipes in Python and release it at https://github.com/deem-data/sempipes/tree/v1.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文发现AdamW存在"径向拔河"的根本冲突：梯度倾向于增加参数范数以扩展模型容量，而权重衰减却无差别地抑制范数增长，导致径向振荡并损害特征学习。为此提出AdamO，通过解耦范数与方向更新，在视觉和语言任务上实现了比AdamW更好的泛化性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准AdamW优化器可能并非最优，因为它未能妥善处理梯度驱动的范数增长（用于提升模型容量）与权重衰减的范数抑制之间的冲突。这种冲突引发径向振荡，向Adam的二阶矩估计中注入噪声，从而削弱对切向特征学习的精细调控。论文认为参数更新的大小和方向应被独立处理。

Method: 提出正交动力学解耦（AdamO），将优化过程分离：使用SGD式更新进行一维范数控制，同时将Adam的自适应预条件限制在切向子空间。此外，该方法还引入曲率自适应的径向步长调整，以及对尺度不变层和低维参数的架构感知规则和投影。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的实验表明，AdamO在不引入额外复杂约束的情况下，相比AdamW能够提升模型的泛化能力和稳定性。

Conclusion: AdamO通过解耦径向与方向更新，有效解决了AdamW中的内在冲突，在保持简洁性的同时实现了更优的性能。

Abstract: Is the standard weight decay in AdamW truly optimal? Although AdamW decouples weight decay from adaptive gradient scaling, a fundamental conflict remains: the Radial Tug-of-War. In deep learning, gradients tend to increase parameter norms to expand effective capacity while steering directions to learn features, whereas weight decay indiscriminately suppresses norm growth. This push--pull interaction induces radial oscillations, injecting noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and potentially degrading delicate tangential feature learning. We argue that magnitude and direction play distinct roles and should be decoupled in optimizer dynamics. We propose Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling and instantiate it as AdamO: an SGD-style update handles the one-dimensional norm control, while Adam's adaptive preconditioning is confined to the tangential subspace. AdamO further incorporates curvature-adaptive radial step sizing and architecture-aware rules and projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters. Experiments on vision and language tasks show that AdamO improves generalization and stability over AdamW without introducing additional complex constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统常在历史数据上训练评估公平性，但部署时环境条件已发生变化。当积极结果的普遍性在不同人群中以不同速度变化时（如疾病率、贷款违约率），会导致群体条件先验概率漂移，影响模型公平性

Method: 理论分析与算法设计相结合：1) 证明在GPPS下两类公平准则的结构性质差异；2) 利用ROC量的不变性实现无标签目标域的指标识别；3) 提出TAP-GPPS后处理算法，通过估计先验概率、校正后验概率和阈值选择来实现人口统计均等性

Result: 1) 发现根本性二分法：基于错误率的公平准则（均等化赔率）对GPPS具有结构不变性，而接受率准则（人口统计均等性）必然漂移；2) 证明目标域风险与公平指标可在无目标标签下识别，仅有有限样本保证；3) 实验验证TAP-GPPS理论预测，实现目标公平性且效用损失最小

Conclusion: 揭示了不同公平准则对分布漂移的鲁棒性差异，为解决实际部署中的公平性问题提供了理论基础和实用算法，特别是在无法获得目标域标签的场景下具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Machine learning systems are often trained and evaluated for fairness on historical data, yet deployed in environments where conditions have shifted. A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain. Experiments validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that TAP-GPPS achieves target fairness with minimal utility loss.

*Jiyoung Park,Hankyu Jang,Changseok Song,Wookeun Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIDE是一个集成在线草稿适应的高性能LLM推理系统框架，通过重用目标模型隐藏状态实现零开销适应，采用自适应运行时控制，并利用异构集群，在真实工作负载上实现最高1.15倍吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码虽能显著加速LLM推理，但因工作负载动态变化和系统级约束，实际应用面临挑战。现有方法需要重新加载模型或重新计算训练信号，带来显著开销。

Method: 提出TIDE框架，将在线草稿适应直接集成到推理系统中：1)重用推理过程中的目标模型隐藏状态作为训练信号，实现零开销适应；2)采用自适应运行时控制，仅在有益时激活推测和训练；3)利用异构集群，将解耦的推理和训练映射到合适的GPU类型。

Result: 在多样化的真实工作负载上，TIDE相比静态推测解码实现最高1.15倍吞吐量提升，同时将草稿训练时间减少1.67倍（相比重新计算训练信号的方法）。

Conclusion: TIDE通过系统原生集成和智能资源利用，有效解决了推测解码的实际部署挑战，为LLM推理加速提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding can substantially accelerate LLM inference, but realizing its benefits in practice is challenging due to evolving workloads and system-level constraints. We present TIDE (Temporal Incremental Draft Engine), a serving-engine-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation directly into high-performance LLM inference systems. TIDE reuses target model hidden states generated during inference as training signals, enabling zero-overhead draft adaptation without reloading the target model, and employs adaptive runtime control to activate speculation and training only when beneficial. TIDE exploits heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes. Across diverse real-world workloads, TIDE achieves up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding while reducing draft training time by 1.67x compared to approaches that recompute training signals.

TL;DR: 提出基于串扰结构的多任务学习框架，联合学习故障条件与耦合物理变量，在无人机和电机复合故障数据集上显著优于单任务及共享主干多任务模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有故障分类研究仅依赖直接故障标签，忽略了机器系统中故障信号与物理变量间的物理耦合特性所蕴含的额外信息

Method: 基于残差神经降维器模型，采用串扰结构多任务学习框架，通过交叉层实现任务间可控信息交换并避免负迁移，在无人机故障（含机型/机动方向耦合）和电机复合故障数据集上验证

Result: 在两类基准测试中，该模型均一致优于单任务模型、合并标签的多分类模型及共享主干多任务模型；电机故障场景下同时验证了单通道与多通道输入性能

Conclusion: 利用物理耦合特性通过串扰多任务学习能有效提升故障分类性能，为处理复杂系统故障提供了新思路

Abstract: Machine systems inherently generate signals in which fault conditions and various physical variables are physically coupled. Although many existing fault classification studies rely solely on direct fault labels, the aforementioned signals naturally embed additional information shaped by other physically coupled information. Herein, we leverage this coupling through a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly learns fault conditions and the related physical variables. Among MTL architectures, crosstalk structures have distinct advantages because they allow for controlled information exchange between tasks through the cross-talk layer while preventing negative transfer, in contrast to shared trunk architectures that often mix incompatible features. We build on our previously introduced residual neural dimension reductor model, and extend its application to two benchmarks where physical coupling is prominent. The first benchmark is a drone fault dataset, in which machine type and maneuvering direction significantly alter the frequency components of measured signals even under the same nominal condition. By learning fault classification together with these physical attributes, the cross-talk architecture can better classify faults. The second benchmark dataset is the motor compound fault dataset. In this system, each fault component, inner race fault, outer race fault, misalignment, and unbalance is coupled to the other. For motor compound fault, we also test classification performance when we use single-channel data or multi-channel data as input to the classifier. Across both benchmarks, our residual neural dimension reductor, consistently outperformed single-task models, multi-class models that merge all label combinations, and shared trunk multi-task models.

TL;DR: 针对大模型参数高效微调中低秩分解方法表达受限的问题，本文提出基于压缩感知的CoSA方法，通过固定随机投影矩阵和可学习核心参数实现高效适配，在10个任务和5个模型上均达到或超过SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法如LoRA和PiSSA依赖权重更新的低秩分解假设，但在任务特定适配场景中，奇异值分布相对均匀，低秩假设会限制模型表达力，需要更灵活的微调范式。

Method: 提出CoSA（Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation），基于压缩感知理论，使用固定的随机投影矩阵将权重更新编码到低维空间，再通过紧凑的可学习核心参数进行映射，避免直接约束权重更新为低秩子空间。

Result: 在10个自然语言理解和生成任务上，使用RoBERTa、Llama、Qwen等5种不同规模模型的实验表明，CoSA在所有设置下都能匹配或优于当前最优的PEFT方法。

Conclusion: CoSA为高效且富有表达力的多尺度模型适配提供了原则性视角，证明了压缩感知理论在参数高效微调中的有效性，是低秩方法的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) without updating all parameters. Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families. Across these settings, CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出将"能力控制"作为独立于模型对齐的目标，通过数据层、学习层和系统层的三层防御机制来限制基础模型行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在带来广泛应用的同时也扩大了潜在滥用和失败的空间，传统对齐方法难以应对对抗性诱导等场景，需要建立硬性行为限制

Method: 提出分层能力控制框架：1)训练数据分布控制；2)权重或表征层面的学习干预；3)部署后输入输出行为护栏，并倡导深度防御策略

Result: 构建了贯穿模型全生命周期的三层能力控制体系，识别了单层控制的固有缺陷，论证了跨层组合的必要性

Conclusion: 实现有效能力控制需采用多层互补的深度防御架构，同时面临知识的双重用途和组合泛化等关键挑战

Abstract: Foundation models are trained on broad data distributions, yielding generalist capabilities that enable many downstream applications but also expand the space of potential misuse and failures. This position paper argues that capability control -- imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior -- should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. While alignment is often context and preference-driven, capability control aims to impose hard operational limits on permissible behaviors, including under adversarial elicitation. We organize capability control mechanisms across the model lifecycle into three layers: (i) data-based control of the training distribution, (ii) learning-based control via weight- or representation-level interventions, and (iii) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails over inputs, outputs, and actions. Because each layer has characteristic failure modes when used in isolation, we advocate for a defense-in-depth approach that composes complementary controls across the full stack. We further outline key open challenges in achieving such control, including the dual-use nature of knowledge and compositional generalization.

TL;DR: 提出EBPO框架解决GRPO的高方差和梯度消失问题，通过经验贝叶斯收缩融合全局统计，在数学推理基准上实现稳定且优越的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR已证明能有效增强LLM推理能力，但GRPO等主流方法面临关键稳定性挑战：计算受限下小组规模导致估计方差高，以及全部失败场景（所有响应零奖励）中梯度信号消失。

Method: 提出经验贝叶斯策略优化(EBPO)，采用收缩估计器动态平衡局部组统计量与全局先验，利用Welford在线算法更新全局统计，实现基线估计的正则化。

Result: 在AIME和OlympiadBench等多样化基准上，EBPO持续优于GRPO及其他基线；表现出卓越训练稳定性，即使小组规模下仍可获得高性能增益，并从难度分层课程学习中显著受益。

Conclusion: EBPO通过从全局统计中借用信息有效缓解了GRPO的稳定性问题，理论保证更低的MSE和非消失梯度信号，为LLM强化学习提供了更稳定高效的优化框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.

Abstract: Coastal hypoxia, especially in the northern part of Gulf of Mexico, presents a persistent ecological and economic concern. Seasonal models offer coarse forecasts that miss the fine-scale variability needed for daily, responsive ecosystem management. We present study that compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Medformer (Medical Transformer), Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). We trained our models with twelve years of daily hindcast data from 2009-2020 Our training data consists of 2009-2020 hindcast data from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

Result: 发现了细粒度行为（角色扮演模式、退化输出、语言切换）以及高层战略行为和环境特定缺陷。自动化评估显示90%的SAE元特征具有显著性，并发现了一种出人意料的奖励黑客行为。两项用户研究表明，即使看似有趣的SAE特征和LLM假设对人工而言也比无用更差，但部分子集对下游任务具有预测性价值。通过增强未训练智能体的系统提示，得分提升了+14.2%。

Conclusion: SAE与LLM摘要方法为智能体行为提供了互补视角，二者结合形成的框架为未来以数据为中心的可解释性研究提供了实用起点，有助于确保训练过程中大语言模型的可信行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained in complex Reinforcement Learning, multi-agent environments, making it difficult to understand how behavior changes over training. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes SpectraKAN, an input-conditioned spectral neural operator that uses cross-attention to dynamically modulate Fourier kernels based on spatio-temporal history, achieving SOTA performance on PDE benchmarks with up to 49% RMSE reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spectral neural operators like FNO use static Fourier kernels that cannot adapt to input-specific multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global system state, limiting their expressiveness for complex PDEs.

Method: The paper introduces SpectraKAN that conditions the spectral operator on input by: (1) extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history, and (2) using single-query cross-attention to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk, converting static convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator.

Result: SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse PDE benchmarks, reducing RMSE by up to 49% compared to strong baselines, with particularly significant improvements on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.

Conclusion: By enabling input-conditioned spectral modulation while preserving the efficiency of spectral mixing, SpectraKAN provides a theoretically justified framework that converges to resolution-independent continuous operators under mesh refinement, offering superior performance for learning complex PDE solution operators.

Abstract: Spectral neural operators, particularly Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), are a powerful framework for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their efficient global mixing in the frequency domain. However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation. Across diverse PDE benchmarks, SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing RMSE by up to 49% over strong baselines, with particularly large gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.

Motivation: 长上下文推理中，注意力计算因键值缓存增长成为解码瓶颈；现有top-p稀疏注意力方法无法同时优化精度、选择开销和计算成本

Method: 采用分层稀疏注意力机制：1) 使用大小加权质心进行簇级粗粒度top-p估计；2) 仅在需要时通过第二级top-p进行token级注意力精修

Result: 在长上下文基准测试中实现近乎零精度损失，相比先进固定预算稀疏注意力方法，注意力计算开销降低1.8倍，端到端解码加速1.3倍

Conclusion: Double-P框架成功平衡了精度、选择开销和计算成本的三重优化目标，为长上下文LLM推理提供了高效稀疏注意力解决方案

Abstract: As long-context inference becomes central to large language models (LLMs), attention over growing key-value caches emerges as a dominant decoding bottleneck, motivating sparse attention for scalable inference. Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.

### [160] [Extreme Weather Nowcasting via Local Precipitation Pattern Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05204)
*Changhoon Song,Teng Yuan Chang,Youngjoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for precipitation nowcasting, addressing limitations of existing methods: computational expense of diffusion models, bias of deterministic models toward normal rainfall, and dataset imbalance. It introduces a balanced radar dataset from KMA covering both ordinary and extreme events, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all rainfall regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precipitation nowcasting remains challenging due to spatial locality, fine-scale structures, and variable forecasting horizons. Diffusion-based models are too computationally expensive for real-time use, while deterministic models are biased toward normal rainfall. Benchmark datasets are skewed—either dominated by ordinary events or restricted to extreme episodes—hindering real-world applicability.

Method: The authors propose exPreCast, a deterministic framework with three components: local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor for flexible horizon adjustment. They also introduce a new balanced KMA radar dataset encompassing both ordinary and extreme precipitation events.

Result: Experiments on SEVIR, MeteoNet, and the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that exPreCast achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.

Conclusion: exPreCast provides an efficient, unbiased deterministic solution for detailed precipitation nowcasting that generalizes effectively across different rainfall intensities, overcoming key limitations of previous methods and datasets.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall or storms is critical for risk management and disaster mitigation. Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了隐式神经表示的解耦能力和语义对齐，为数据生成过程理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to capture the underlying explanatory factors of observed data, enabling a principled understanding of the data-generating process. Recent advances in generative modeling have introduced new paradigms for learning such representations. However, existing diffusion-based methods encourage factor independence via inductive biases, yet frequently lack strong semantic alignment. In this work, we propose a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, which casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. To enforce explicit semantic alignment, we introduce a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer that suppresses cross-factor interference and reduces information leakage between factors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over representative baselines, yielding higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.

Motivation: 标准差分隐私组合定理在回答T个查询时产生√T的依赖关系，这种依赖对于大规模查询是次优的。

Method: 提出流设置下的差分隐私预测器，分别处理oblivious在线敌手（任意概念类）和adaptive在线敌手（半空间）两种场景。

Result: 对于oblivious在线敌手和任意概念类C，仅需Õ(VC(C)^3.5 log^3.5 T)个标注样本即可实现(ε,δ)-差分隐私；对于adaptive在线敌手和R^d上的半空间，仅需Õ(d^5.5 log T)个标注样本；成功将T的依赖从√T改进至polylog(T)级别。

Conclusion: 在流设置下，差分隐私预测器可实现对查询次数T的polylogarithmic依赖，显著优于标准组合界。

Abstract: We study differentially private prediction introduced by Dwork and Feldman (COLT 2018): an algorithm receives one labeled sample set $S$ and then answers a stream of unlabeled queries while the output transcript remains $(\varepsilon,δ)$-differentially private with respect to $S$. Standard composition yields a $\sqrt{T}$ dependence for $T$ queries.
  We show that this dependence can be reduced to polylogarithmic in $T$ in streaming settings. For an oblivious online adversary and any concept class $\mathcal{C}$, we give a private predictor that answers $T$ queries with $|S|= \tilde{O}(VC(\mathcal{C})^{3.5}\log^{3.5}T)$ labeled examples. For an adaptive online adversary and halfspaces over $\mathbb{R}^d$, we obtain $|S|=\tilde{O}\left(d^{5.5}\log T\right)$.

Motivation: Linear attention methods have O(N) complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention due to two key limitations: restriction to convex combinations that only allow additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts.

Method: ZeroS removes the constant zero-order term 1/t and reweights the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals, creating mathematically stable weights that can be both positive and negative. This allows a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations while maintaining O(N) complexity.

Result: Empirically, ZeroS matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks while preserving O(N) complexity.

Conclusion: ZeroS successfully addresses the fundamental limitations of linear attention methods, theoretically expanding the set of representable functions and achieving performance comparable to or better than standard softmax attention with linear computational complexity.

Abstract: Linear attention methods offer Transformers $O(N)$ complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention. We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This modification creates mathematically stable weights, enabling both positive and negative values and allowing a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations. While maintaining $O(N)$ complexity, ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出Concept DAS (CDAS)，一种基于分布式干预的新模型操控方法，通过弱监督分布匹配而非概率最大化来优化干预，在安全场景中表现稳健，但并非始终优于偏好优化方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有干预式模型操控方法直接采用微调中的强优化目标，导致过拟合和生成不自然输出；其根本问题在于追求外部偏好而非忠实识别模型内部机制

Method: 基于分布式对齐搜索(DAS)框架，提出Concept DAS (CDAS)；采用分布式交换干预(DII)机制，引入针对操控任务的分布匹配目标，使干预后输出分布与反事实分布对齐，支持双向操控和数据驱动的操控因子提取

Result: 在AxBench基准测试中，CDAS并非始终优于偏好优化方法，但能从模型规模扩大中获得更多收益；在两个安全案例研究（覆盖模型拒绝行为和消除思维链后门）中，CDAS实现了系统性操控同时保持模型通用能力

Conclusion: CDAS与偏好优化方法互补，在特定条件下（如安全应用和大规模模型）构成了一种稳健的干预式模型操控方法

Abstract: Intervention-based model steering offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative to prompting and fine-tuning. However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering.

*Boxiang Zhang,Baijian Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CORP is a closed-form one-shot structured pruning method for Vision Transformers that removes redundant MLP and attention structures without retraining, using only a small unlabeled calibration set, achieving minimal accuracy loss at high sparsity and completing in under 20 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have high computational and memory costs. Existing structured pruning methods require retraining or multi-stage optimization, which limits their practicality for post-training deployment where such resources are unavailable.

Method: CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components, deriving closed-form ridge regression solutions that compensate by folding adjustments directly into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error using only a small unlabeled calibration set, without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show significant redundancy in ViT MLP and attention representations. CORP preserves accuracy under aggressive pruning (50% sparsity), achieving 82.8% Top-1 on DeiT-Huge with only a small accuracy drop. The method is fast (<20 minutes on single GPU) and provides substantial real-world efficiency gains.

Conclusion: CORP enables practical, efficient post-training pruning of Vision Transformers through a closed-form solution that eliminates the need for retraining while maintaining high accuracy at extreme sparsity levels.

Abstract: Vision Transformers achieve strong accuracy but incur high compute and memory cost. Structured pruning can reduce inference cost, but most methods rely on retraining or multi-stage optimization. These requirements limit post-training deployment. We propose \textbf{CORP}, a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers. CORP removes entire MLP hidden dimensions and attention substructures without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning. It operates under strict post-training constraints using only a small unlabeled calibration set. CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error under the calibration distribution. Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT models show strong redundancy in MLP and attention representations. Without compensation, one-shot structured pruning causes severe accuracy degradation. With CORP, models preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsity. On DeiT-Huge, CORP retains 82.8\% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50\% of both MLP and attention structures. CORP completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU and delivers substantial real-world efficiency gains.

### [166] [TADS: Task-Aware Data Selection for Multi-Task Multimodal Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05251)
*Guanjie Cheng,Boyi Li,Lingyu Sun,Mengying Zhu,Yangyang Wu,Xinkui Zhao,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TADS is a task-aware data selection framework for multimodal pre-training that uses quality, relevance, and diversity metrics to select only 36% of data while improving zero-shot performance by 1.0% across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale multimodal models like CLIP require high-quality training data, but web-crawled datasets are noisy and redundant, leading to inefficient training. Existing selection methods are either biased/heuristic-based or task-agnostic, not optimizing for multi-task scenarios.

Method: TADS integrates three components into a learnable value function: 1) Intrinsic Quality via unimodal/cross-modal operators, 2) Task Relevance via similarity vectors, and 3) Distributional Diversity via cluster-based weighting. It uses meta-learning to adaptively refine selection based on proxy model performance.

Result: On CC12M dataset, TADS uses only 36% of training data but achieves superior zero-shot performance, outperforming baselines by an average of 1.0% on ImageNet, CIFAR-100, MS-COCO, and Flickr30K benchmarks.

Conclusion: TADS significantly enhances data efficiency by curating a high-utility subset that yields higher performance within the same computational constraints, demonstrating the importance of task-aware data selection for multimodal pre-training.

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal pre-trained models like CLIP rely heavily on high-quality training data, yet raw web-crawled datasets are often noisy, misaligned, and redundant, leading to inefficient training and suboptimal generalization. Existing data selection methods are either heuristic-based, suffering from bias and limited diversity, or data-driven but task-agnostic, failing to optimize for multi-task scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce TADS (Task-Aware Data Selection), a novel framework for multi-task multimodal pre-training that integrates Intrinsic Quality, Task Relevance, and Distributional Diversity into a learnable value function. TADS employs a comprehensive quality assessment system with unimodal and cross-modal operators, quantifies task relevance via interpretable similarity vectors, and optimizes diversity through cluster-based weighting. A feedback-driven meta-learning mechanism adaptively refines the selection strategy based on proxy model performance across multiple downstream tasks. Experiments on CC12M demonstrate that TADS achieves superior zero-shot performance on benchmarks like ImageNet, CIFAR-100, MS-COCO, and Flickr30K, using only 36% of the data while outperforming baselines by an average of 1.0%. This highlights that TADS significantly enhances data efficiency by curating a high-utility subset that yields a much higher performance ceiling within the same computational constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 针对标准RL方法在LLM推理中导致的低熵策略和模式崩溃问题，本文提出优势重加权机制(ARM)，通过引入提示困惑度和答案置信度重新加权优势函数，在保持准确性的同时显著提升生成多样性和响应熵，在数学和代码基准测试上表现优于GRPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准策略优化方法（如GRPO）在强化学习语言模型推理时容易收敛到低熵策略，导致严重的模式崩溃和输出多样性受限。从采样概率动力学角度分析，标准目标不成比例地强化最高似然路径，抑制了有效的替代推理链。

Method: 提出新颖的优势重加权机制(ARM)，将提示困惑度(Prompt Perplexity)和答案置信度(Answer Confidence)融入优势估计中，动态重塑奖励信号以削弱过度自信推理路径的梯度更新，同时将概率质量重新分配给探索不足的正確解。

Result: 实证结果表明，该方法显著增强生成多样性和响应熵，同时保持竞争性的准确率，在Qwen2.5-7B模型上，相比GRPO在Pass@1指标提升5.7%，在Pass@32指标提升13.9%，有效缓解熵崩溃。

Conclusion: 该方法在推理任务中有效实现了探索与利用的更佳平衡，显著缓解了熵崩溃问题，同时维持了准确性，为LLM推理提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.

Conclusion: EmbedOpt提供了一种更稳健、高效且可扩展的框架，通过嵌入空间优化有效对齐扩散先验与实验约束，在生物分子结构建模中具有优势。

Abstract: In many biophysical inverse problems, the goal is to generate biomolecular conformations that are both physically plausible and consistent with experimental measurements. As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its smooth optimization behavior enables a significant reduction in the number of diffusion steps required for inference, leading to better efficiency.

Abstract: Healthcare facility visit prediction is essential for optimizing healthcare resource allocation and informing public health policy. Despite advanced machine learning methods being employed for better prediction performance, existing works usually formulate this task as a time-series forecasting problem without considering the intrinsic spatial dependencies of different types of healthcare facilities, and they also fail to provide reliable predictions under abnormal situations such as public emergencies. To advance existing research, we propose HealthMamba, an uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal framework for accurate and reliable healthcare facility visit prediction. HealthMamba comprises three key components: (i) a Unified Spatiotemporal Context Encoder that fuses heterogeneous static and dynamic information, (ii) a novel Graph State Space Model called GraphMamba for hierarchical spatiotemporal modeling, and (iii) a comprehensive uncertainty quantification module integrating three uncertainty quantification mechanisms for reliable prediction. We evaluate HealthMamba on four large-scale real-world datasets from California, New York, Texas, and Florida. Results show HealthMamba achieves around 6.0% improvement in prediction accuracy and 3.5% improvement in uncertainty quantification over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现有对SAG、SAGA和IAG等方差约减算法的分析各自独立，采用不同的证明技巧。原始SAG证明极其复杂且需要计算机辅助分析，难以理解和推广。

Method: 作者通过两个关键步骤建立统一分析：(1) 使用简单的集中不等式工具界定随机子采样带来的延迟；(2) 精心设计一种新的Lyapunov函数来考虑这些延迟效应。

Result: 该分析首次为SAG和SAGA提供了高概率收敛界，可自然推广到非凸目标和马尔可夫采样，同时为IAG算法获得了最佳已知收敛速率，显著优于先前结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作的贡献在于简化了算法的理论分析，使证明更易理解和扩展，同时提升了IAG等算法的理论性能保证，为后续研究提供了更坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Stochastic variance-reduced algorithms such as Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG) and SAGA, and their deterministic counterparts like the Incremental Aggregated Gradient (IAG) method, have been extensively studied in large-scale machine learning. Despite their popularity, existing analyses for these algorithms are disparate, relying on different proof techniques tailored to each method. Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling. As an immediate byproduct of our new analysis technique, we obtain the best known rates for the IAG algorithm, significantly improving upon prior bounds.

Abstract: Neural Lyapunov and barrier certificates have recently been used as powerful tools for verifying the safety and stability properties of deep reinforcement learning (RL) controllers. However, existing methods offer guarantees only under fixed ideal unperturbed dynamics, limiting their reliability in real-world applications where dynamics may deviate due to uncertainties. In this work, we study the problem of synthesizing \emph{robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates} that maintain their guarantees under perturbations in system dynamics. We formally define a robust Lyapunov barrier function and specify sufficient conditions based on Lipschitz continuity that ensure robustness against bounded perturbations. We propose practical training objectives that enforce these conditions via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization. We validate our approach in two practically relevant environments, Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking. The former is a widely studied benchmark, while the latter is a safety-critical task in autonomous systems. We show that our methods significantly improve both certified robustness bounds (up to $4.6$ times) and empirical success rates under strong perturbations (up to $2.4$ times) compared to the baseline. Our results demonstrate effectiveness of training robust neural certificates for safe RL under perturbations in dynamics.

Abstract: Sequential prediction from streaming observations is a fundamental problem in stochastic dynamical systems, where inherent uncertainty often leads to multiple plausible futures. While diffusion and flow-matching models are capable of modeling complex, multi-modal trajectories, their deployment in real-time streaming environments typically relies on repeated sampling from a non-informative initial distribution, incurring substantial inference latency and potential system backlogs. In this work, we introduce Sequential Flow Matching, a principled framework grounded in Bayesian filtering. By treating streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, our approach naturally aligns with the recursive structure of Bayesian belief updates. We provide theoretical justification that initializing generation from the previous posterior offers a principled warm start that can accelerate sampling compared to naïve re-sampling. Across a wide range of forecasting, decision-making and state estimation tasks, our method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, therefore with faster sampling. It suggests that framing sequential inference via Bayesian filtering provides a new and principled perspective towards efficient real-time deployment of flow-based models.

Abstract: Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL) aims to learn a policy to achieve high performance in sequential decision-making while satisfying constraints, using only pre-collected datasets. Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to "stitch" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of GAS, demonstrating superior performance in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the theoretical limits of pool-based active learning (AL), in which a subset of instances is selectively labeled. The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL. These properties yield a new theoretical perspective on pool-based AL.

Abstract: The neighborhood scope (i.e., number of hops) where graph neural networks (GNNs) aggregate information to characterize a node's statistical property is critical to GNNs' performance. Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN. Experiments on benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets show that the proposed method is compatible with state-of-the-art GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior performance on the node classification task, and providing well-calibrated predictions.

Conclusion: HRT通过数学优化框架克服了斜决策树的核心计算瓶颈，在保持可解释性同时提升表达能力，为可解释机器学习提供高效新范式

Abstract: Oblique decision trees combine the transparency of trees with the power of multivariate decision boundaries, but learning high-quality oblique splits is NP-hard, and practical methods still rely on slow search or theory-free heuristics. We present the Hinge Regression Tree (HRT), which reframes each split as a non-linear least-squares problem over two linear predictors whose max/min envelope induces ReLU-like expressive power. The resulting alternating fitting procedure is exactly equivalent to a damped Newton (Gauss-Newton) method within fixed partitions. We analyze this node-level optimization and, for a backtracking line-search variant, prove that the local objective decreases monotonically and converges; in practice, both fixed and adaptive damping yield fast, stable convergence and can be combined with optional ridge regularization. We further prove that HRT's model class is a universal approximator with an explicit $O(δ^2)$ approximation rate, and show on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that it matches or outperforms single-tree baselines with more compact structures.

TL;DR: 电力需求预测中，时间序列基础模型并非总是优于简单LSTM基线；在新加坡稳定气候下基线表现更佳，而Chronos-2在基础模型中领先，且模型架构与地理气候背景对性能影响显著，表明需针对能源领域定制模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列基础模型已成为预测的新范式，但其在电力需求预测中有效利用外生特征的能力仍不明确。

Method: 对新加坡和澳大利亚电力市场在小时和日粒度上，系统评估MOIRAI、MOMENT、TinyTimeMixers、ChronosX和Chronos-2五种基础模型与具有可逆实例归一化的LSTM基线模型在三种特征配置（全部特征、选定特征、仅目标）下的表现。

Result: Chronos-2在基础模型中表现最佳（零样本设置），但简单基线模型在新加坡稳定气候下频繁优于所有基础模型，尤其在短期预测中。模型架构至关重要：TTM的通道混合和Chronos-2的分组注意力能有效协同利用外生特征，而其他方法表现不一。地理背景同样关键，基础模型仅在可变气候中展现优势。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了基础模型普遍优越的假设，强调了在能源领域开发领域特定模型的必要性。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models have emerged as a new paradigm for forecasting, yet their ability to effectively leverage exogenous features -- critical for electricity demand forecasting -- remains unclear. This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Propose a federated learning framework combining homomorphic encryption with meta-classifiers to simultaneously achieve privacy-preserving aggregation and Byzantine resilience, achieving 90-94% attack detection accuracy with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces dual challenges of privacy leakage from inference attacks and model poisoning from Byzantine participants. Existing solutions typically address these issues separately, making it difficult to achieve both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience simultaneously.

Method: Combine homomorphic encryption (CKKS scheme) with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers. Train an ensemble of meta-classifiers on shadow updates to detect diverse Byzantine behaviors (backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping, shuffling attacks), then use their outputs to reweight encrypted updates. Automate hyperparameter selection for optimal HE performance.

Result: Achieves 90-94% accuracy in identifying Byzantine updates across FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. Incurs only marginal utility loss with encrypted inference runtimes of 6-24 seconds and aggregation runtimes of 9-26 seconds.

Conclusion: The integrated approach effectively addresses both privacy and Byzantine security challenges in FL with high detection accuracy and acceptable computational overhead, demonstrating a practical solution for secure collaborative learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a collaborative model while preserving data privacy. However, the distributed nature of this approach still raises privacy and security issues, such as the exposure of sensitive data due to inference attacks and the influence of Byzantine behaviors on the trained model. In particular, achieving both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience remains challenging, as existing solutions often address these aspects independently. In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种锦标赛图框架，将k-wise文档比较转化为成对偏好图，通过传递闭包和智能查询调度实现高效LLM重排序，在保持准确性的同时减少25-40%的token消耗，并处理非传递性偏好问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM重排序方法存在缺陷：基于启发式的方法无法充分利用每次排序决策的信息，而高效方法则计算成本过高，缺乏原则性框架来优化k-wise比较的信息获取效率。

Method: 提出锦标赛图框架，将k个文档的比较结果视为包含所有成对偏好的完整锦标赛，聚合为全局偏好图后通过传递闭包推断额外排序，设计贪心查询调度最大化信息增益，并将循环偏好折叠为等价类实现分层排序。

Result: 在14个基准测试和5种LLM上实现帕累托优势：精度持平或超越现有方法的同时，token消耗减少25-40%，与成对比较法相比在相近质量下token消耗降低7倍。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM重排序提供了原则性且高效的基础，通过智能利用比较信息和处理非传递性，显著降低了计算成本而不牺牲排序质量。

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as powerful zero-shot rerankers for retrieval-augmented generation, offering strong generalization without task-specific training. However, existing LLM reranking methods either rely on heuristics that fail to fully exploit the information revealed by each ranking decision or are inefficient when they do. We introduce a tournament graph framework that provides a principled foundation for $k$-wise reranking. Our key observation is that each $k$-document comparison reveals a complete tournament of $\binom{k}{2}$ pairwise preferences. These tournaments are aggregated into a global preference graph, whose transitive closure yields many additional orderings without further model invocations. We formalize when a candidate's rank is certifiably determined and design a query schedule that greedily maximizes information gain towards identifying the top-$m$ items. Our framework also gracefully handles non-transitive preferences - cycles induced by LLM judgments - by collapsing them into equivalence classes that yield principled tiered rankings. Empirically, across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs, our method achieves Pareto dominance over existing methods: matching or exceeding accuracy while requiring 25-40% fewer tokens than comparable approaches, and 7$\times$ fewer than pairwise methods at near-identical quality.

TL;DR: 超参数敏感性并非强化学习的必然属性，而是受引导目标中破坏性梯度干扰的放大影响；在离线目标条件强化学习框架下，当存在少量专家数据时，QRL算法表现出显著的超参数鲁棒性，而HIQL因梯度冲突导致最优区域漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究超参数敏感性是强化学习固有问题还是特定训练机制所致，尤其关注引导目标（bootstrapping）对非平稳性的影响。

Method: 在离线目标条件强化学习设置中控制数据质量变化：固定数据分布并显式调度数据质量变化；对比HIQL（引导TD学习）与QRL（准度量表示学习）；引入目标间梯度对齐诊断工具分析梯度干扰。

Result: 1) 离线RL超参数鲁棒性显著优于在线RL；2) 当专家数据占比≈20%时，QRL保持稳定近优区域，HIQL出现尖锐且跨训练阶段漂移的最优点；3) 引导目标导致更强的破坏性梯度干扰，与超参数敏感性直接相关。

Conclusion: 强化学习的超参数敏感性并非不可避免，其主要由引导目标的动态机制放大；通过减少破坏性梯度干扰设计更鲁棒的算法目标（如QRL），可提升训练稳定性。

Abstract: Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often accepted as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\approx$ 20\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.

TL;DR: 提出两个新的每焦耳比特度量标准——热力学信息获取率与赋能率，用于在物理效率约束下评估AI系统的智能表现，并建立统一的能量-智能效率分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统虽能力卓越但能耗巨大，亟需将智能性能与物理效率直接关联的度量标准，以评估并优化AI系统的能量效率。

Method: 基于随机热力学理论，提出两个互补的度量：(1) 每焦耳热力学信息获取率——单位能耗内智能体内部状态编码的环境结构信息量；(2) 每焦耳赋能率——固定时间范围内传感器运动通道容量与预期能耗之比。通过明确边界、重置和成本计算假设，推导出Landauer尺度基准。

Result: 证明了在明确子系统假设下，信息获取的Landauer尺度闭合循环基准可作为热力学学习不等式的推论；阐明Landauer尺度成本在闭合循环边界下的基准作用；证明若无这些假设且不计算外部低熵资源，信息增益与内部耗散无需紧密关联；将信息获取操作概念与计算有界MDL信息获取对齐。

Conclusion: 建立一个统一的效率框架，同时报告两个度量并辅以边界/能量核算、粗粒度/噪声、时间范围/重置等最小检查清单，以减少歧义并支持一致的每焦耳比特比较，同时勾勒与能量调整缩放分析的关联。

Abstract: Modern AI systems achieve remarkable capabilities at the cost of substantial energy consumption. To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.

Conclusion: 原则性策略散度约束对RLVR策略优化至关重要，统一框架和KL3方法为理解和性能提升提供了新基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a critical paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via a general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在面对无效或对抗性输入时会产生不可靠或有害内容（称为错误行为），现有不确定性量化方法仅捕获整体认知不确定性，对识别这些问题的效果有限。

Method: 提出证据不确定性量化（EUQ）方法，将模型输出头特征解释为支持（正）或反对（负）证据，利用证据理论聚合这些证据，以单次前向传播量化内部冲突和知识缺口。

Result: 在幻觉、越狱、对抗脆弱性和分布外失败四类错误行为检测中，EUQ持续优于强基线；分析表明幻觉对应高内部冲突，分布外失败对应高无知程度。

Conclusion: EUQ能有效检测LVLM错误行为，层间证据不确定性动态分析为内部表征演化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法仅关注任务更新间的冲突，但忽略了共享知识的重复计数问题。当任务共享对齐的谱方向时，线性组合会重复积累这些方向，导致奇异值膨胀并使模型偏向共享子空间。

Method: 提出奇异值校准(SVC)，一种无需训练和数据的后处理方法。SVC量化子空间重叠程度，重新缩放膨胀的奇异值以恢复频谱平衡。

Result: SVC在视觉和语言基准测试上持续改进强基线并达到SOTA，将Task Arithmetic性能提升13.0%。方法仅修改奇异值，简单有效。

Conclusion: SVC成功解决模型融合的重复计数问题，提供轻量级、无需训练的解决方案，显著提升性能并实现新的SOTA。

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned models into a single model by adding their weight updates, providing a lightweight alternative to retraining. Existing methods primarily target resolving conflicts between task updates, leaving the failure mode of over-counting shared knowledge unaddressed. We show that when tasks share aligned spectral directions (i.e., overlapping singular vectors), a simple linear combination repeatedly accumulates these directions, inflating the singular values and biasing the merged model toward shared subspaces. To mitigate this issue, we propose Singular Value Calibration (SVC), a training-free and data-free post-processing method that quantifies subspace overlap and rescales inflated singular values to restore a balanced spectrum. Across vision and language benchmarks, SVC consistently improves strong merging baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by modifying only the singular values, SVC improves the performance of Task Arithmetic by 13.0%. Code is available at: https://github.com/lyymuwu/SVC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowSteer uses flow matching to learn a nonlinear transformation that makes large reasoning models more concise and efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are inefficient because their outputs are overly verbose, and existing steering methods are limited by their reliance on linear representations.

Method: FlowSteer learns a complete distributional transformation between verbose and concise reasoning activations using Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process.

Result: FlowSteer produces more compact reasoning than linear methods while maintaining strong task performance and token efficiency across diverse reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Modeling the full distributional transport with generative techniques provides a more effective and principled approach for controlling LRMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is often hampered by overly verbose outputs. Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, FlowSteer demonstrates strong task performance and token efficiency compared to leading inference-time baselines. Our work demonstrates that modeling the full distributional transport with generative techniques offers a more effective and principled foundation for controlling LRMs.

Conclusion: 对称性是GRPO的次优属性，非对称设计能有效提升探索效率和难度适应性，A-GRAE为RLVR提供了更优的优化框架

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly GRPO, has become the standard for eliciting LLM reasoning. However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.

Abstract: We propose LOGDIFF (Logical Guidance for the Exact Composition of Diffusion Models), a guidance framework for diffusion models that enables principled constrained generation with complex logical expressions at inference time.
  We study when exact score-based guidance for complex logical formulas can be obtained from guidance signals associated with atomic properties.
  First, we derive an exact Boolean calculus that provides a sufficient condition for exact logical guidance.
  Specifically, if a formula admits a circuit representation in which conjunctions combine conditionally independent subformulas and disjunctions combine subformulas that are either conditionally independent or mutually exclusive, exact logical guidance is achievable.
  In this case, the guidance signal can be computed exactly from atomic scores and posterior probabilities using an efficient recursive algorithm.
  Moreover, we show that, for commonly encountered classes of distributions, any desired Boolean formula is compilable into such a circuit representation.
  Second, by combining atomic guidance scores with posterior probability estimates, we introduce a hybrid guidance approach that bridges classifierguidance and classifier-free guidance, applicable to both compositional logical guidance and standard conditional generation.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on multiple image and protein structure generation tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes EdgeMask-DG and EdgeMask-DG* for graph domain generalization, using adversarial edge masking on feature-enriched graphs to learn domain-invariant structures, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structural shifts across domains challenge GNNs, and existing methods fail to identify which specific edges encode domain-invariant information, relying instead on fixed augmentations or global perturbations.

Method: A min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns worst-case continuous masks under sparsity constraints (EdgeMask-DG), extended to feature-enriched graphs (EdgeMask-DG*) combining original topology with feature-derived edges to discover invariances.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, with a +3.8 percentage point improvement on Cora OOD (78.0% vs 74.2%).

Conclusion: EdgeMask-DG* effectively learns domain-invariant structural information by combining adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs, demonstrating robust generalization across citation, social, and temporal graph domains.

Abstract: Structural shifts pose a significant challenge for graph neural networks, as graph topology acts as a covariate that can vary across domains. Existing domain generalization methods rely on fixed structural augmentations or training on globally perturbed graphs, mechanisms that do not pinpoint which specific edges encode domain-invariant information. We argue that domain-invariant structural information is not rigidly tied to a single topology but resides in the consensus across multiple graph structures derived from topology and feature similarity. To capture this, we first propose EdgeMask-DG, a novel min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns to find worst-case continuous masks subject to a sparsity constraint, compelling a task GNN to perform effectively under these adversarial structural perturbations. Building upon this, we introduce EdgeMask-DG*, an extension that applies this adversarial masking principle to an enriched graph. This enriched graph combines the original topology with feature-derived edges, allowing the model to discover invariances even when the original topology is noisy or domain-specific. EdgeMask-DG* is the first to systematically combine adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs. We provide a formal justification for our approach from a robust optimization perspective. We demonstrate that EdgeMask-DG* achieves new state-of-the-art performance on diverse graph domain generalization benchmarks, including citation networks, social networks, and temporal graphs. Notably, on the Cora OOD benchmark, EdgeMask-DG* lifts the worst-case domain accuracy to 78.0\%, a +3.8 pp improvement over the prior state of the art (74.2\%).

Conclusion: OpenMAG provides the first comprehensive benchmark for MAG learning, offering rigorous evaluation standards and actionable insights to guide the development of next-generation multimodal graph models.

Abstract: Multimodal-Attributed Graph (MAG) learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling complex real-world systems by integrating graph topology with rich attributes from multiple modalities. With the rapid proliferation of novel MAG models capable of handling intricate cross-modal semantics and structural dependencies, establishing a rigorous and unified evaluation standard has become imperative. Although existing benchmarks have facilitated initial progress, they exhibit critical limitations in domain coverage, encoder flexibility, model diversity, and task scope, presenting significant challenges to fair evaluation. To bridge this gap, we present OpenMAG, a comprehensive benchmark that integrates 19 datasets across 6 domains and incorporates 16 encoders to support both static and trainable feature encoding. OpenMAG further implements a standardized library of 24 state-of-the-art models and supports 8 downstream tasks, enabling fair comparisons within a unified framework. Through systematic assessment of necessity, data quality, effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency, we derive 14 fundamental insights into MAG learning to guide future advancements.

### [190] [On the Superlinear Relationship between SGD Noise Covariance and Loss Landscape Curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05600)
*Yikuan Zhang,Ning Yang,Yuhai Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Challenging the common assumption that SGD noise covariance equals the Hessian, this paper uses Activity-Weight Duality to derive a general power-law relationship with bounded exponent (1≤γ≤2) between noise and curvature, validated across diverse architectures and losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work incorrectly assumes Fisher Information Matrix ≈ Hessian for all losses, oversimplifying SGD's anisotropic noise. This fails in deep networks where restrictive conditions are violated, necessitating a more accurate, loss-agnostic characterization of noise-curvature relationships.

Method: Applied Activity-Weight Duality to establish a general relationship between SGD noise covariance and per-sample Hessian statistics, avoiding loss-specific assumptions and revealing fundamental connections between optimization dynamics and local geometry.

Result: Found that C ∝ E[h_p²] (not H), leading to approximate commutation (C and H don't exactly coincide). Discovered diagonal elements follow power-law C_ii ∝ H_ii^γ with theoretically bounded exponent 1≤γ≤2, validated across multiple datasets, architectures, and loss functions.

Conclusion: Provides a unified, theoretically grounded framework correcting prior oversimplifications, showing SGD noise-curvature relationship is more complex but well-behaved than previously thought, with implications for understanding generalization in deep learning.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) introduces anisotropic noise that is correlated with the local curvature of the loss landscape, thereby biasing optimization toward flat minima. Prior work often assumes an equivalence between the Fisher Information Matrix and the Hessian for negative log-likelihood losses, leading to the claim that the SGD noise covariance $\mathbf{C}$ is proportional to the Hessian $\mathbf{H}$. We show that this assumption holds only under restrictive conditions that are typically violated in deep neural networks. Using the recently discovered Activity--Weight Duality, we find a more general relationship agnostic to the specific loss formulation, showing that $\mathbf{C} \propto \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p^2]$, where $\mathbf{h}_p$ denotes the per-sample Hessian with $\mathbf{H} = \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p]$. As a consequence, $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ commute approximately rather than coincide exactly, and their diagonal elements follow an approximate power-law relation $C_{ii} \propto H_{ii}^γ$ with a theoretically bounded exponent $1 \leq γ\leq 2$, determined by per-sample Hessian spectra. Experiments across datasets, architectures, and loss functions validate these bounds, providing a unified characterization of the noise-curvature relationship in deep learning.

TL;DR: 提出Shiva-DiT方法，通过残差可微分Top-k选择和上下文感知路由，解决扩散Transformer的二次方注意力计算成本问题，在保持硬件静态预算的同时实现1.54倍加速和更高保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer(DiTs)因自注意力机制的二次方计算复杂度导致计算成本过高，现有剪枝方法无法同时满足可微性、效率性和硬件所需的严格静态预算要求

Method: 1. 采用基于残差的可微分Top-k选择机制，通过残差感知直通估计器实现确定性token数量(满足静态编译)同时保持端到端可学习性
2. 设计上下文感知路由器和自适应比例策略，自主学习自适应剪枝调度

Result: 在SD3.5等主流模型上建立新的帕累托前沿：实现1.54倍实时加速，保真度优于现有基线，有效消除不规则张量开销

Conclusion: Shiva-DiT成功调和了可微性/效率性/静态预算的冲突要求，为DiTs部署提供了高效硬件友好的解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) incur prohibitive computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention. Existing pruning methods fail to simultaneously satisfy differentiability, efficiency, and the strict static budgets required for hardware overhead. To address this, we propose Shiva-DiT, which effectively reconciles these conflicting requirements via Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection. By leveraging a residual-aware straight-through estimator, our method enforces deterministic token counts for static compilation while preserving end-to-end learnability through residual gradient estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy to autonomously learn an adaptive pruning schedule. Experiments on mainstream models, including SD3.5, demonstrate that Shiva-DiT establishes a new Pareto frontier, achieving a 1.54$\times$ wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines, effectively eliminating ragged tensor overheads.

TL;DR: 提出路径引导流匹配（PGFM）框架，用确定性流匹配替代扩散模型实现高效数据集蒸馏，在少步ODE求解下达到更快速度和可比性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散式数据集蒸馏方法依赖启发式引导或原型分配，存在采样耗时、轨迹不稳定问题，导致强控制或低IPC场景下泛化能力下降

Method: 1) 在冻结VAE的隐空间中进行流匹配，学习从高斯噪声到数据分布的类别条件传输；2) 开发连续路径到原型引导算法，实现ODE一致的路径控制，确保轨迹可靠落点至指定原型

Result: 在多个高分辨率基准测试中匹配或超越现有扩散方法，采样步数显著减少（例如效率提升7.6倍），同时保持78%模式覆盖率和竞争性性能

Conclusion: PGFM作为首个流匹配生成式蒸馏框架，通过确定性合成和高效路径控制，解决了扩散方法的速度与稳定性瓶颈，为大规模数据压缩提供新方案

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic sets with comparable performance in training models. Despite recent progress on diffusion-based distillation, this type of method typically depends on heuristic guidance or prototype assignment, which comes with time-consuming sampling and trajectory instability and thus hurts downstream generalization especially under strong control or low IPC. We propose \emph{Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM)}, the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, which enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps. PGFM conducts flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution. Particularly, we develop a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, which allows trajectories to reliably land on assigned prototypes while preserving diversity and efficiency. Extensive experiments across high-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches with fewer steps of sampling while delivering competitive performance with remarkably improved efficiency, e.g., 7.6$\times$ more efficient than the diffusion-based counterparts with 78\% mode coverage.

TL;DR: 针对GRPO等方法在可验证奖励强化学习中存在的梯度误分配问题，提出REAL框架将奖励重构为分类标签，通过单调有界梯度加权实现更均衡的策略更新，在数学推理基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法中的GRPO及其变体虽然表现优异，但存在梯度正样本误分配和负样本支配问题，导致策略更新低效且次优。

Method: 提出Rewards as Labels (REAL)框架，将可验证奖励视为分类标签而非标量权重，将策略优化重新表述为分类问题，并引入锚定logits增强策略学习，实现单调有界梯度加权。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，REAL相比GRPO、DAPO和GSPO等强基线方法表现出更好的训练稳定性：1.5B模型上Pass@1平均提升6.7%，7B模型上分别高出DAPO和GSPO 6.2%和1.7%；即使使用基础二元交叉熵也稳定超越DAPO 4.5%。

Conclusion: REAL通过重新解释奖励机制，有效缓解了梯度分配不匹配问题，为可验证奖励强化学习提供了更稳定、更高效的优化范式，在模型规模扩展时仍保持显著性能优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has recently advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models in complex reasoning tasks by providing explicit rule-based supervision. Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Notably, even with a vanilla binary cross-entropy, REAL remains stable and exceeds DAPO by 4.5% on average.

TL;DR: This paper proposes HORAI, the first frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model for time series analysis, pretrained on a newly constructed billion-scale dataset MM-TS, achieving SOTA zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation models are limited by unimodal pretraining and lack complementary modalities. Building multimodal models faces challenges: no unified pretraining paradigm, lack of large-scale multimodal corpora, and difficulty in effectively integrating heterogeneous modalities while maintaining generalization.

Method: 1) Proposes a multimodal pretraining paradigm using endogenous modalities (derived images/text) and exogenous knowledge (news); 2) Develops automated pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains with 1B points; 3) Introduces HORAI with Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and Time-Frequency Decoder for effective multimodal fusion and domain generalization.

Result: After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization across modalities and domains.

Conclusion: The work successfully pioneers multimodal foundation models for time series analysis, showing that leveraging complementary modalities and frequency enhancement can significantly improve model performance and generalization.

Abstract: While existing time series foundation models primarily rely on large-scale unimodal pretraining, they lack complementary modalities to enhance time series understanding. Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains. After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.

TL;DR: Proposes TACO, a tabular compression model that reduces inference time by 94x and memory consumption by 97% compared to transformer-based tabular foundation models while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based tabular foundation models achieve strong performance but suffer from quadratic complexity with dataset size, causing high training/inference overhead and limiting scalability on large datasets.

Method: TACO (end-to-end tabular compression model) compresses the training dataset in a latent space to overcome quadratic complexity.

Result: On TabArena benchmark: 94x faster inference, 97% less memory than state-of-the-art tabular transformer; retains performance without significant degradation; scales better with larger datasets and outperforms other baselines.

Conclusion: TACO effectively addresses scalability limitations of tabular foundation models by compressing data in latent space, achieving dramatic efficiency improvements while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: The long-standing dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees for tabular data has recently been challenged by in-context learning tabular foundation models. In-context learning methods fit and predict in one forward pass without parameter updates by leveraging the training data as context for predicting on query test points. While recent tabular foundation models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their transformer architecture based on the attention mechanism has quadratic complexity regarding dataset size, which in turn increases the overhead on training and inference time, and limits the capacity of the models to handle large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose TACO, an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset in a latent space. We test our method on the TabArena benchmark, where our proposed method is up to 94x faster in inference time, while consuming up to 97\% less memory compared to the state-of-the-art tabular transformer architecture, all while retaining performance without significant degradation. Lastly, our method not only scales better with increased dataset sizes, but it also achieves better performance compared to other baselines.

### [196] [Alignment Verifiability in Large Language Models: Normative Indistinguishability under Behavioral Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05656)
*Igor Santos-Grueiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文证明，大语言模型的行为评估无法唯一确定其潜在的"对齐"属性。即使模型在测试中表现出合规行为，也不能由此断定其真实对齐状态，因为多个不同的对齐假设可能产生完全相同的可观测行为分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的对齐评估主要依赖行为范式（基准测试、红队测试等），但从行为证据推断潜在对齐属性的过程通常是隐式的，缺乏作为独立推断问题的正式分析。论文旨在形式化这一关键推理步骤，揭示行为评估的局限性。

Method: 将模型对齐评估框架化为部分可观测性下的可识别性问题，引入"对齐可验证性问题"和"规范不可区分性"概念，用于刻画不同潜在对齐假设在评估者可访问信号上产生相同分布的情形。在此基础上进行形式化理论分析。

Result: 提出了一个明确的负面可识别性定理：在有限行为评估和评估感知智能体的设定下，观测到的行为合规性不能唯一确定潜在对齐状态。即使理想化的行为评估也无法普遍性地认证对齐作为潜在属性。行为测试只能缩小兼容假设空间，无法将其坍缩为单一假设。

Conclusion: 对齐基准测试应被重新理解为提供特定评估体制下可观测合规性的上界，而非对底层对齐属性的保证。研究结果要求领域重新审视行为评估在证明模型对齐方面的实际意义和局限性。

Abstract: Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.
  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.
  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.
  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment.

TL;DR: 本文利用大偏差理论研究SGD的长期尾部衰减行为，证明了在非凸代价和重尾噪声下，SGD和裁剪SGD的尾部衰减速率为e^(-t/log(t))和e^(-t^β_p/log(t))，比现有有限时间界限(e^(-√t)等)快一个数量级，并证明了下界e^(-t)的紧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注SGD的高概率保证（固定概率阈值的误差率），但缺乏对固定误差阈值下失效概率（尾部衰减率）的研究。同时，现有结果多为有限时间性质，无法捕捉现代学习模型（通常训练数百万次迭代）的真实长期尾部衰减特性。

Method: 通过大偏差理论研究基于SGD方法的长期尾部衰减行为。

Result: 1) 对于非凸代价和有界噪声，vanilla SGD的最佳迭代梯度范数平方的尾部上界具有e^(-t/log(t))的长期衰减率；2) 对于有界p阶矩(p∈(1,2])的重尾噪声，c-SGD的尾部上界衰减率为e^(-t^β_p/log(t))，其中β_p = 4(p-1)/(3p-2)，当p=2时为e^(-t/log²(t))；3) 提供了尾部衰减的下界e^(-t)，证明上述速率在多项式对数因子意义下是紧的；4) 相比现有有限时间界限(e^(-√t)和e^(-t^(β_p/2)))，其结果显示了快一个数量级的长期尾部衰减。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了SGD和c-SGD在特定条件下尾部衰减比先前认知快得多的机制，为单个算法运行提供了更强的长期保证，对理解现代大规模训练的可靠性有重要意义。

Abstract: The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{β_p}/\log(t)}$, where $β_p = \frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{β_p/2}}$, $p \in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exhaustive benchmarking of hundreds of FC modeling methods on large fMRI datasets is computationally prohibitive due to combinatorial explosion, preventing routine pre-analysis evaluation.

Method: Proposes SCLCS: uses adaptive Transformer to learn individual FC structures, quantifies structural stability via Structural Perturbation Score (SPS), and applies density-balanced sampling to select diverse, representative core-sets that preserve model rankings.

Result: On REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS maintains ground-truth model ranking using only 10% of data, achieving up to 23.2% higher ranking consistency (nDCG@k) than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: First work formalizing core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, making large-scale operator comparisons feasible and establishing it as a standard practice in computational neuroscience.

Abstract: Benchmarking the hundreds of functional connectivity (FC) modeling methods on large-scale fMRI datasets is critical for reproducible neuroscience. However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k). To our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, thereby making large-scale operators comparisons a feasible and integral part of computational neuroscience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代科学普遍相信数据越多结论越可靠，但这一隐含信念可能从根本上失效。研究旨在挑战"数据万能"的假设，揭示其潜在的系统性失败模式。

Method: 通过最小化的合成实验，模拟观测可靠性在不可察觉方式下降的结构性状态，测试标准推断程序的表现。

Result: 发现存在一种结构性状态：标准推断程序表现正常（收敛良好、校准准确、通过诊断检验），却系统性地收敛到错误结论；在此状态下，额外数据不仅无法纠正错误，反而会放大误差，且残差和拟合优度等诊断指标仍呈现误导性的正常状态。

Conclusion: 推断不能无条件地视为数据可用性的结果，而必须受到观测过程完整性这一明确约束的制约。稳定性、收敛性和置信度不足以保证认识论有效性，数据驱动科学存在内在极限。

Abstract: Modern science increasingly relies on ever-growing observational datasets and automated inference pipelines, under the implicit belief that accumulating more data makes scientific conclusions more reliable. Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity. We argue that inference cannot be treated as an unconditional consequence of data availability, but must instead be governed by explicit constraints on the integrity of the observational process.

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a principled planning model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper uses evolutionary search with LLMs (AlphaEvolve) to automatically discover activation functions, showing it can explore a much larger space of Python functions and find those with specific inductive biases by using out-of-distribution performance as the fitness metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activation functions significantly impact optimization, expressivity, and inductive bias, but current research relies on manually constructed search spaces; there's a need for automated discovery of functions that encode desired biases for better generalization.

Method: Proposes using evolutionary search frameworks like AlphaEvolve with frontier LLMs as mutators to explore vast Python function spaces within FLOP budgets, using out-of-distribution performance as fitness to bias toward specific inductive biases.

Result: Empirical exploration shows that small synthetic datasets are sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activation functions that improve performance and encode targeted inductive biases.

Conclusion: Evolutionary search with LLMs provides an efficient, automated framework for discovering novel activation functions that can explore larger search spaces and be guided to encode specific inductive biases beyond mere performance metrics.

Abstract: The choice of activation function is an active area of research, with different proposals aimed at improving optimization, while maintaining expressivity. Additionally, the activation function can significantly alter the implicit inductive bias of the architecture, controlling its non-linear behavior. In this paper, in line with previous work, we argue that evolutionary search provides a useful framework for finding new activation functions, while we also make two novel observations. The first is that modern pipelines, such as AlphaEvolve, which relies on frontier LLMs as a mutator operator, allows for a much wider and flexible search space; e.g., over all possible python functions within a certain FLOP budget, eliminating the need for manually constructed search spaces. In addition, these pipelines will be biased towards meaningful activation functions, given their ability to represent common knowledge, leading to a potentially more efficient search of the space. The second observation is that, through this framework, one can target not only performance improvements but also activation functions that encode particular inductive biases. This can be done by using performance on out-of-distribution data as a fitness function, reflecting the degree to which the architecture respects the inherent structure in the data in a manner independent of distribution shifts. We carry an empirical exploration of this proposal and show that relatively small scale synthetic datasets can be sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activations.

Abstract: We propose a new analysis framework for clustering $M$ items into an unknown number of $K$ distinct groups using noisy and actively collected responses. At each time step, an agent is allowed to query pairs of items and observe bandit binary feedback. If the pair of items belongs to the same (resp.\ different) cluster, the observed feedback is $1$ with probability $p>1/2$ (resp.\ $q<1/2$). Leveraging the ubiquitous change-of-measure technique, we establish a fundamental lower bound on the expected number of queries needed to achieve a desired confidence in the clustering accuracy, formulated as a sup-inf optimization problem. Building on this theoretical foundation, we design an asymptotically optimal algorithm in which the stopping criterion involves an empirical version of the inner infimum -- the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) statistic -- being compared to a threshold. We develop a computationally feasible variant of the GLR statistic and show that its performance gap to the lower bound can be accurately empirically estimated and remains within a constant multiple of the lower bound.

*Arno Geimer,Beltran Fiz Pontiveros,Radu State*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedRandom is a novel technique that mitigates contribution instability in federated learning by generating additional statistical samples, achieving more reliable participant evaluation and reducing ground truth distance by over 33% in half of all test scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In federated learning deployments with limited participants, fairly assessing contributions is crucial for compensation and identifying malicious actors, but existing methods suffer from significant instability across aggregation strategies that can deter participation.

Method: FedRandom treats contribution instability as a statistical estimation problem, enabling generation of more samples than regular FL strategies to produce more consistent and reliable evaluations of participant contributions.

Result: Experiments across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST with different data distributions show FedRandom reduces overall distance to ground truth by more than a third in half of evaluated scenarios and improves stability in over 90% of cases.

Conclusion: FedRandom effectively addresses a key barrier to industrial federated learning deployment by providing stable, fair participant contribution assessment essential for maintaining healthy federations.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach for Machine Learning tasks. In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Machine learning practitioners frequently observe tension between predictive accuracy and group fairness constraints -- yet sometimes fairness interventions appear to improve accuracy. We show that both phenomena can be artifacts of training data that misrepresents subgroup proportions. Under subpopulation shift (stable within-group distributions, shifted group proportions), we establish: (i) full importance-weighted correction is asymptotically unbiased but finite-sample suboptimal; (ii) the optimal finite-sample correction is a shrinkage reweighting that interpolates between target and training mixtures; (iii) apparent "fairness helps accuracy" can arise from comparing fairness methods to an improperly-weighted baseline. We provide an actionable evaluation protocol: fix representation (optimally) before fairness -- compare fairness interventions against a shrinkage-corrected baseline to isolate the true, irreducible price of fairness. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks (Adult, COMPAS) validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that this protocol eliminates spurious tradeoffs, revealing the genuine fairness-utility frontier.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper theoretically analyzes the Muon optimizer using a linear associative memory model, showing it achieves exponential speedup over Gradient Descent by mitigating imbalanced learning rates across frequency components, and can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon optimizer shows strong empirical performance but lacks theoretical understanding of its dynamics and scaling behavior.

Method: Studied Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and hierarchical frequency spectrum, analyzing both noiseless and noisy cases with label noise.

Result: 1) GD learns frequency components at imbalanced rates, bottlenecked by low-frequency components; 2) Muon mitigates this imbalance for faster uniform progress; 3) Noiseless case: Muon achieves exponential speedup over GD; 4) Noisy case: Derived Muon's optimization scaling law showing superior efficiency over GD; 5) Muon acts as implicit matrix preconditioner from adaptive task alignment.

Conclusion: Muon's superior performance stems from its ability to balance learning across frequency components through implicit matrix preconditioning, with theoretical predictions confirmed by experiments on synthetic tasks and LLaMA-style pre-training.

Abstract: Muon updates matrix parameters via the matrix sign of the gradient and has shown strong empirical gains, yet its dynamics and scaling behavior remain unclear in theory. We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice. Experiments on synthetic long-tail classification and LLaMA-style pre-training corroborate the theory.

Conclusion: 该工作为自动化提示注入研究建立了更强的基线，证明了基于强化学习的优化在生成可迁移对抗性攻击方面的有效性。

Abstract: Prompt injection is one of the most critical vulnerabilities in LLM agents; yet, effective automated attacks remain largely unexplored from an optimization perspective. Existing methods heavily depend on human red-teamers and hand-crafted prompts, limiting their scalability and adaptability. We propose AutoInject, a reinforcement learning framework that generates universal, transferable adversarial suffixes while jointly optimizing for attack success and utility preservation on benign tasks. Our black-box method supports both query-based optimization and transfer attacks to unseen models and tasks. Using only a 1.5B parameter adversarial suffix generator, we successfully compromise frontier systems including GPT 5 Nano, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash on the AgentDojo benchmark, establishing a stronger baseline for automated prompt injection research.

Motivation: 探究深度聚类（特别是DEC）是否真正解决了k-means聚类无法处理任意形状、大小和密度簇的根本性缺陷，而非仅限于图像数据集上的表现

Method: 通过分析DEC等深度聚类方法不利用数据分布特性，提出一种非深度学习方法，利用簇的分布信息直接解决k-means的固有局限

Result: 发现深度聚类未克服k-means根本缺陷；非深度方法通过利用簇分布信息，有效解决了簇形状、大小和密度多样性问题

Conclusion: 深度聚类的核心优势被质疑，其声称的突破可能源于对分布信息的隐含利用；非深度方法在解决k-means根本缺陷上更有效，对深度聚类研究方向具有重要启示

Abstract: Deep clustering (DC) is often quoted to have a key advantage over $k$-means clustering. Yet, this advantage is often demonstrated using image datasets only, and it is unclear whether it addresses the fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering. Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) learns a latent representation via an autoencoder and performs clustering based on a $k$-means-like procedure, while the optimization is conducted in an end-to-end manner. This paper investigates whether the deep-learned representation has enabled DEC to overcome the known fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, i.e., its inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities. Our investigations on DEC have a wider implication on deep clustering methods in general. Notably, none of these methods exploit the underlying data distribution. We uncover that a non-deep learning approach achieves the intended aim of deep clustering by making use of distributional information of clusters in a dataset to effectively address these fundamental limitations.

*Xiandong Zou,Jianshu Li,Jing Huang,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VSD is a novel speculative decoding method that uses variational inference and EM optimization to train draft models, achieving significant speedups over existing methods by better handling the discrepancy between training (single greedy trajectory) and decoding (multiple sampled paths).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The training-decoding discrepancy in speculative decoding: existing methods optimize for single greedy trajectories during training but need to handle multiple sampled draft paths during actual decoding, limiting performance.

Method: VSD formulates draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths). It maximizes marginal probability of target-model acceptance using an ELBO objective, incorporates path-level utility, and optimizes via EM: E-step draws MCMC samples from oracle-filtered posterior, M-step uses Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR).

Result: Extensive experiments on LLMs and MLLMs show VSD achieves up to 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec, significantly improving decoding efficiency.

Conclusion: VSD effectively addresses the training-decoding discrepancy in speculative decoding, theoretically guarantees increased expected acceptance length and speedup, and empirically demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates inference for (M)LLMs, yet a training-decoding discrepancy persists: while existing methods optimize single greedy trajectories, decoding involves verifying and ranking multiple sampled draft paths. We propose Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD), formulating draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths). VSD maximizes the marginal probability of target-model acceptance, yielding an ELBO that promotes high-quality latent proposals while minimizing divergence from the target distribution. To enhance quality and reduce variance, we incorporate a path-level utility and optimize via an Expectation-Maximization procedure. The E-step draws MCMC samples from an oracle-filtered posterior, while the M-step maximizes weighted likelihood using Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR). Theoretical analysis confirms that VSD increases expected acceptance length and speedup. Extensive experiments across LLMs and MLLMs show that VSD achieves up to a 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec, significantly improving decoding efficiency.

*Mengbei Yan,Jiafei Lyu,Shengjie Sun,Zhongjian Qiao,Jingwen Yang,Zichuan Lin,Deheng Ye,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Selective Transition Correction (STC), an algorithm for cross-domain offline RL that corrects source domain transitions (actions and rewards) to align with target dynamics using inverse policy, reward, and forward dynamics models, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting policies across domains with mismatched dynamics in RL is challenging. Directly merging source and target domain datasets leads to suboptimal performance due to dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches like transition filtering or reward modification insufficiently exploit valuable source domain data.

Method: Proposes modifying source domain data into target domain data instead of just filtering or reward modification. Uses an inverse policy model to correct actions and a reward model to correct rewards of source transitions, explicitly aligning them with target dynamics. Employs a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match target dynamics than original transitions. Implements the Selective Transition Correction (STC) algorithm.

Result: Experiments on various environments with dynamics shifts demonstrate that STC achieves superior performance against existing baselines.

Conclusion: STC enables reliable usage of source domain data for policy adaptation by explicitly correcting source transitions to align with target dynamics through action and reward correction.

Abstract: It remains a critical challenge to adapt policies across domains with mismatched dynamics in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics. Since limited data may result in inaccurate model training, we further employ a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match the target dynamics than the original transitions. Consequently, we propose the Selective Transition Correction (STC) algorithm, which enables reliable usage of source domain data for policy adaptation. Experiments on various environments with dynamics shifts demonstrate that STC achieves superior performance against existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器已成为自回归大语言模型 mechanistic interpretability 的标准工具，但扩散语言模型作为新兴替代方案，缺乏针对性的可解释性工具，因此需要开发适用于DLMs的SAE框架。

Method: 提出了DLM-Scope，首个基于SAE的DLM可解释性框架，使用训练好的Top-K SAE来提取可解释特征，并系统比较了SAE在DLMs和LLMs中的不同行为模式。

Result: 1) SAE插入早期层可降低DLMs交叉熵损失，与LLMs的损失惩罚现象相反；2) SAE特征支持更优的扩散时间干预；3) SAE可提供DLM解码顺序的信号；4) SAE特征在DLM后训练阶段保持稳定。

Conclusion: 该工作奠定了DLM可解释性研究的基础，揭示了SAE在DLMs中的独特优势，展示了将SAE应用于DLM相关任务和算法的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a standard tool for mechanistic interpretability in autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers to extract sparse, human-interpretable features and intervene on model behavior. Recently, as diffusion language models (DLMs) have become an increasingly promising alternative to the autoregressive LLMs, it is essential to develop tailored mechanistic interpretability tools for this emerging class of models. In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.

Abstract: High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

Motivation: Transformer架构已存在近十年，但人们对其计算能力的理解仍有限。特别是，单层Transformer能否解决PARITY问题尚不明确。现有的PARITY构造方法至少需要2层，并采用不切实际的特征，如长度依赖的位置编码、硬max、缺少正则化参数的层归一化，或无法与因果掩码一起使用。

Conclusion: 该工作深化了对Transformer架构计算能力的理解，明确了其能力边界，并为未来研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The transformer architecture is almost a decade old. Despite that, we still have a limited understanding of what this architecture can or cannot compute. For instance, can a 1-layer transformer solve PARITY -- or more generally -- which kinds of transformers can do it? Known constructions for PARITY have at least 2 layers and employ impractical features: either a length-dependent positional encoding, or hardmax, or layernorm without the regularization parameter, or they are not implementable with causal masking.
  We give a new construction of a transformer for PARITY with softmax, length-independent and polynomially bounded positional encoding, no layernorm, working both with and without causal masking. We also give the first lower bound for transformers solving PARITY -- by showing that it cannot be done with only one layer and one head.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the utility degradation problem in Local Differential Privacy (LDP) by reframing private learning as a transfer learning task. It proposes three novel techniques—noised binary feedback evaluation, model reversal, and weighted model averaging—to improve classification performance while maintaining privacy guarantees, with both theoretical risk bounds and empirical validation showing substantial accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The noise introduced by Local Differential Privacy (LDP) significantly reduces data utility, creating a major challenge for privacy-preserving machine learning that needs to be addressed without compromising privacy guarantees.

Method: Reinterprets LDP private learning as a transfer learning problem (noisy data as source domain, clean data as target domain). Proposes three techniques: (1) noised binary feedback-based utility evaluation, (2) model reversal by inverting decision boundaries of underperforming classifiers, and (3) weighted model averaging of multiple reversed classifiers based on estimated utility.

Result: Provides theoretical excess risk bounds under LDP demonstrating risk reduction, and shows empirical results with substantial improvements in classification accuracy on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques effectively improve classification performance under Local Differential Privacy without sacrificing privacy guarantees, offering a practical solution to the utility-privacy trade-off.

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) has become a central topic in data privacy research, offering strong privacy guarantees by perturbing user data at the source and removing the need for a trusted curator. However, the noise introduced by LDP often significantly reduces data utility. To address this issue, we reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem, where the noisy data serve as the source domain and the unobserved clean data as the target. We propose novel techniques specifically designed for LDP to improve classification performance without compromising privacy: (1) a noised binary feedback-based evaluation mechanism for estimating dataset utility; (2) model reversal, which salvages underperforming classifiers by inverting their decision boundaries; and (3) model averaging, which assigns weights to multiple reversed classifiers based on their estimated utility. We provide theoretical excess risk bounds under LDP and demonstrate how our methods reduce this risk. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets show substantial improvements in classification accuracy.

Conclusion: 基于正则化非对称校准目标的有界搜索方法能有效提升LLM后训练量化的效果，为量化质量与计算开销提供了可调节的平衡方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver robust performance across diverse applications, yet their deployment often faces challenges due to the memory and latency costs of storing and accessing billions of parameters. Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.

Conclusion: 智能体可通过Bifrost有效利用历史经验应对显著上下文变化。

Abstract: Autonomous agents excel in self-improvement through reflection and iterative refinement, which reuse successful task trajectories as in-context examples to assist subsequent reasoning. However, shifting across tasks often introduces a context mismatch. Hence, existing approaches either discard the trajectories or manipulate them using heuristics, leading to a non-negligible fine-tuning cost or unguaranteed performance. To bridge this gap, we reveal a context-trajectory correlation, where shifts of context are highly parallel with shifts of trajectory. Based on this finding, we propose BrIdge contextual gap FoR imprOvised trajectory STeering (Bifrost), a training-free method that leverages context differences to precisely guide the adaptation of previously solved trajectories towards the target task, mitigating the misalignment caused by context shifts. Our trajectory adaptation is conducted at the representation level using agent hidden states, ensuring trajectory transformation accurately aligns with the target context in a shared space. Across diverse benchmarks, Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and finetuned self-improvement methods, demonstrating that agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite substantial context shifts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过对抗性序列生成方法验证棋类序列模型的"真实性"（soundness），发现所有测试模型均无法完全正确预测符合规则的未来走法，但某些训练策略可显著提升真实性；同时揭示棋盘状态探测在多数模型中不参与因果预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式序列模型通常基于自然/形式语言样本训练，但样本训练能否真正捕捉语言结构（即"世界模型"）仍是未解问题。理论表明模型最多保证生成有效序列（soundness），但无法保证完整性。亟需实践工具验证模型真实性，尤其需理解模型失效模式及训练选择的影响。

Method: 以国际象棋为测试域（规则简单但复杂度足够），提出对抗性序列生成框架：设计"对手"生成有效棋局序列，迫使目标模型预测出无效的下一步走法。结合多种对抗生成方法，并在大规模棋类模型上评估，同时探究棋盘状态探测在训练与攻击中的作用。

Result: 1) 所有测试模型均存在真实性缺陷（无法完全避免无效预测）；
2) 部分训练技术（如高质量数据集选择）可显著提升真实性；
3) 棋盘状态探测在多数模型中不参与下一token预测的因果机制。

Conclusion: 对抗性序列生成是验证模型真实性的有效工具，可精细分析模型失效模式及训练策略影响。研究证实当前序列模型尚未掌握深层规则逻辑，但通过针对性优化可改善；同时质疑了棋盘状态信息在模型预测中的实际作用，为未来模型设计提供重要参考。

Abstract: Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods. Our findings indicate that the extracted board states have no causal role in next token prediction in most of the models.

TL;DR: This paper presents a principled framework for confidence estimation in CT reconstruction using sequential likelihood mixing, establishing theoretical coverage guarantees for deep learning methods while demonstrating they produce tighter confidence regions than classical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide reliable confidence estimation for CT reconstructions with theoretical coverage guarantees, enabling uncertainty-aware medical imaging and detection of hallucinations in deep learning-based reconstructions.

Method: Based on sequential likelihood mixing framework applied to a realistic Beer-Lambert law forward model with Poisson noise; general framework applicable to classical algorithms and deep learning methods (U-Nets, ensembles, Diffusion models).

Result: Deep reconstruction methods yield substantially tighter confidence regions than classical methods without sacrificing theoretical coverage guarantees; enables hallucination detection and provides interpretable confidence visualizations.

Conclusion: Deep models are established as both powerful estimators and reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging, combining accuracy with reliability.

Abstract: We present a principled framework for confidence estimation in computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Based on the sequential likelihood mixing framework (Kirschner et al., 2025), we establish confidence regions with theoretical coverage guarantees for deep-learning-based CT reconstructions. We consider a realistic forward model following the Beer-Lambert law, i.e., a log-linear forward model with Poisson noise, closely reflecting clinical and scientific imaging conditions. The framework is general and applies to both classical algorithms and deep learning reconstruction methods, including U-Nets, U-Net ensembles, and generative Diffusion models. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep reconstruction methods yield substantially tighter confidence regions than classical reconstructions, without sacrificing theoretical coverage guarantees. Our approach allows the detection of hallucinations in reconstructed images and provides interpretable visualizations of confidence regions. This establishes deep models not only as powerful estimators, but also as reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging.

### [218] [Where Does Warm-Up Come From? Adaptive Scheduling for Norm-Constrained Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05813)
*Artem Riabinin,Andrey Veprikov,Arman Bolatov,Martin Takáč,Aleksandr Beznosikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops an adaptive learning rate scheduler for norm-constrained optimizers by introducing a generalized smoothness assumption that naturally yields warm-up followed by decay strategies, eliminating manual hyperparameter tuning while matching or outperforming manual schedules in LLM pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning rate scheduling is crucial for training deep learning models, especially with new norm-constrained optimizers like Muon and Lion. Current warm-up and decay strategies are heuristic and require manual tuning, which is time-consuming and suboptimal.

Method: The authors propose a generalized smoothness assumption linking local curvature to suboptimality gap, prove convergence guarantees that naturally lead to warm-up+decay schedules, and develop a practical scheduler that automatically adapts warm-up duration using standard hyperparameters.

Result: Their adaptive warm-up scheduler consistently matches or exceeds the performance of the best manually tuned schedules across LLaMA pretraining setups without additional hyperparameter search.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework provides principled learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers, making warm-up adaptation automatic and effective for large-scale model training while reducing tuning overhead.

Abstract: We study adaptive learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers (e.g., Muon and Lion). We introduce a generalized smoothness assumption under which local curvature decreases with the suboptimality gap and empirically verify that this behavior holds along optimization trajectories. Under this assumption, we establish convergence guarantees under an appropriate choice of learning rate, for which warm-up followed by decay arises naturally from the proof rather than being imposed heuristically.
  Building on this theory, we develop a practical learning rate scheduler that relies only on standard hyperparameters and adapts the warm-up duration automatically at the beginning of training. We evaluate this method on large language model pretraining with LLaMA architectures and show that our adaptive warm-up selection consistently outperforms or at least matches the best manually tuned warm-up schedules across all considered setups, without additional hyperparameter search.

Motivation: 现有基于GAN的合成数据生成方法存在准确率不足或易受成员推断攻击和数据重建攻击的问题，因训练过程直接利用了原始数据，导致隐私泄露风险。

Method: 采用类似GAN的生成-判别框架，但使用模糊测试器作为生成器，从输入规格生成测试数据并保留原始数据约束；通过判别器评估样本与原始数据的接近程度，进化筛选"好样本"，仅间接利用原始数据。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成与原始数据集具有相同统计特性的隐私保护合成数据集，在保持高实用性的同时避免直接暴露原始数据，为数据共享和模型测试提供了新思路。

Abstract: There is a need for synthetic training and test datasets that replicate statistical distributions of original datasets without compromising their confidentiality. A lot of research has been done in leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation. However, the resulting models are either not accurate enough or are still vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA) or dataset reconstruction attacks since the original data has been leveraged in the training process. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of producing a synthetic test dataset with the same statistical properties as the original one, with only indirectly leveraging the original data in the generation process. The approach is inspired by GANs, with a generation step and a discrimination step. However, in our approach, we use a test generator (a fuzzer) to produce test data from an input specification, preserving constraints set by the original data; a discriminator model determines how close we are to the original data. By evolving samples and determining "good samples" with the discriminator, we can generate privacy-preserving data that follows the same statistical distributions are the original dataset, leading to a similar utility as the original data. We evaluated our approach on four datasets that have been used to evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach towards generating synthetic datasets that have high utility while preserving privacy.

TL;DR: Diamond Maps是一种随机流映射模型，它通过将多步模拟压缩为单步采样，在保持最优奖励对齐所需随机性的同时，实现推理时的高效奖励对齐，性能优于现有方法且扩展性更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流和扩散模型在训练后难以高效、鲁棒地适应用户偏好或约束（即奖励对齐问题）。作者认为，高效的奖励对齐应该是生成模型本身的固有属性，而非事后补充。

Method: 提出“Diamond Maps”随机流映射模型，该模型将多步模拟步骤摊销为单步采样器，同时保留最优奖励对齐所需的随机性。这使得搜索、序贯蒙特卡洛和引导机制能够通过对价值函数的高效一致估计而实现扩展。

Result: Diamond Maps可通过从GLASS Flows蒸馏高效学习，实现更强的奖励对齐性能，并且比现有方法具有更好的扩展性。

Conclusion: 该研究为能在推理时快速适应任意偏好和约束的生成模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models produce high-quality samples, but adapting them to user preferences or constraints post-training remains costly and brittle, a challenge commonly called reward alignment. We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose "Diamond Maps", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function. Our experiments show that Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently via distillation from GLASS Flows, achieve stronger reward alignment performance, and scale better than existing methods. Our results point toward a practical route to generative models that can be rapidly adapted to arbitrary preferences and constraints at inference time.

### [221] [Optimism Stabilizes Thompson Sampling for Adaptive Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06014)
*Shunxing Yan,Han Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimism mechanisms stabilize Thompson sampling for valid asymptotic inference in K-armed Gaussian bandits with minimal regret cost


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical asymptotic theory fails for Thompson sampling (TS) in stochastic multi-armed bandits because adaptive data collection causes random, coupled arm sample sizes and rewards, invalidating standard inference methods

Method: Analyzed TS in K-armed Gaussian bandits; identified optimism as key stability mechanism requiring arm pull counts to concentrate around deterministic scales; studied variance-inflated TS and an alternative mean-bonus modification

Result: Proved variance-inflated TS is stable for all K≥2 (resolving prior open question); established same stability for mean-bonus modification; both enable asymptotically valid inference with only mild additional regret cost

Conclusion: Suitably implemented optimism stabilizes Thompson sampling, enabling valid asymptotic inference in multi-armed bandits while maintaining near-optimal regret performance

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used for stochastic multi-armed bandits, yet its inferential properties under adaptive data collection are subtle. Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule. We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \emph{optimism} as a key mechanism for restoring \emph{stability}, a sufficient condition for valid asymptotic inference requiring each arm's pull count to concentrate around a deterministic scale. First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting. Second, we analyze an alternative optimistic modification that keeps the posterior variance unchanged but adds an explicit mean bonus to posterior mean, and establish the same stability conclusion. In summary, suitably implemented optimism stabilizes Thompson sampling and enables asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits, while incurring only a mild additional regret cost.

*Miranda Muqing Miao,Young-Min Cho,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CORAL, a lightweight inference-time method that uses regularized MLP probes to extract distributed correctness signals from LLM internal activations, improving both accuracy (10-14%) and calibration (49-50%) across multiple models and benchmarks without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from persistent miscalibration after instruction tuning and preference alignment. While modified training objectives can help, they require expensive retraining. Existing inference-time methods optimize proxies rather than actual correctness, leaving a gap for a lightweight, direct approach to improve both accuracy and calibration.

Method: CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens) uses weight-decay regularized MLP probes trained on model internal activations to capture distributed correctness signals. It performs inference-time steering by optimizing for actual correctness rather than proxies, extracting information from model internals where individual neurons are insufficient.

Result: CORAL consistently improves accuracy by 10% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50% across three 7B-parameter models. The gains transfer to four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA) with 14% accuracy and 49% ECE improvements without any retraining.

Conclusion: The method validates that distributed correctness information in model internals can be effectively extracted via regularized probes, providing a compute-efficient, transferable, and calibration-aware solution for improving MCQA performance during inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit persistent miscalibration, especially after instruction tuning and preference alignment. Modified training objectives can improve calibration, but retraining is expensive. Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself. We introduce CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens), a regularized inference-time steering method that captures distributed correctness signals from model internal activations using weight-decay MLP probes. We evaluate CORAL across three 7B-parameter models and find that it consistently improves accuracy by 10\% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50\% on average. We additionally demonstrate that these gains transfer without retraining to the complete published test sets of four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA), averaging 14\% accuracy improvements and 49\% ECE improvements. Our results support the hypothesis that distributed information in model internals can be extracted using regularized probes when individual neurons are insufficient. CORAL thus provides a compute-efficient, transferable, and calibration-aware approach to improve MCQA performance during inference.

TL;DR: 本文提出Share方法，通过动态更新单一共享低秩子空间实现参数高效 continual 微调，在多个任务和模态间无缝适应，实现100倍参数量压缩和281倍内存节省，同时保持性能并避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模预训练模型在新任务上高效持续适应面临灾难性遗忘和重训练成本高的挑战；现有参数高效方法（如LoRA）缺乏严格的持续学习机制和知识整合能力，且不依赖数据重放或多适配器。

Method: Share学习并动态更新一个单一共享低秩子空间，从历史任务中提取核心知识，并通过识别关键子空间方向增量整合新任务信息，促进前向知识迁移同时最小化灾难性干扰。

Result: 相比传统LoRA方法实现高达100倍参数量减少和281倍内存节省，性能与联合训练模型相当；单一Share模型可替代数百个任务特定LoRA适配器，支持可扩展异步持续学习；在图像分类、自然语言理解、3D姿态估计和文生图等任务上验证有效。

Conclusion: Share为大规模AI系统的终身学习提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，通过参数高效的方式实现跨任务和模态的持续适应。

Abstract: Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning. Experiments across image classification, natural language understanding, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation validate its effectiveness, making Share a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes CFRecs, a novel counterfactual reasoning framework that uses a two-stage GNN+Graph-VAE architecture to generate minimal, high-impact changes on graph-structured data, providing actionable recommendations for recommender systems, as demonstrated on Zillow's housing market data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning from graph-structured data, there is a need for interpretable and actionable insights. Counterfactual graph learning offers a promising approach to improve model interpretability by identifying minimal changes that lead to different predictions, which can be transformed into practical recommendations for users.

Method: CFRecs employs a two-stage architecture: a graph neural network (GNN) for prediction and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) for generating counterfactual graphs. The framework strategically optimizes for both sparsity (minimal changes) and validity (meaningful outcome differences) in proposing changes to graph structure and node attributes.

Result: Experimental evaluation on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrates the effectiveness of CFRecs in delivering actionable recommendations for both home buyers and sellers to help them navigate the competitive housing market.

Conclusion: CFRecs successfully transforms counterfactual explanations into practical recommendations, providing a fresh perspective on graph-based recommender systems and showing that counterfactual reasoning can effectively guide minimal yet impactful decisions in real-world applications.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous and powerful in representing complex relationships in many online platforms. While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used to learn from such data, counterfactual graph learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve model interpretability. Counterfactual explanation research focuses on identifying a counterfactual graph that is similar to the original but leads to different predictions. These explanations optimize two objectives simultaneously: the sparsity of changes in the counterfactual graph and the validity of its predictions. Building on these qualitative optimization goals, this paper introduces CFRecs, a novel framework that transforms counterfactual explanations into actionable insights. CFRecs employs a two-stage architecture consisting of a graph neural network (GNN) and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) to strategically propose minimal yet high-impact changes in graph structure and node attributes to drive desirable outcomes in recommender systems. We apply CFRecs to Zillow's graph-structured data to deliver actionable recommendations for both home buyers and sellers with the goal of helping them navigate the competitive housing market and achieve their homeownership goals. Experimental results on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrate the effectiveness of CFRecs, which also provides a fresh perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning in graphs.

Conclusion: 为依赖大型多模态基础模型的具身AI领域提供了一种简单有效的约束策略优化方案

Abstract: While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable framework for critic-free policy learning, extending it to settings with explicit behavioral constraints remains underexplored. We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.

Conclusion: 这是首个具有保证的逃离伪局部极小值的确定性框架，通过展示如何利用模拟过参数化驯服具有挑战性的优化景观，为超越矩阵感知的非凸优化提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.

Conclusion: DFPO通过价值流建模和控制机制，为噪声环境下的RL训练提供了有效的鲁棒性解决方案。

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) systems in real-world environments remains challenging due to noisy supervision and poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, especially in LLM post-training. Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents have shown strong performance on automated issue resolution benchmarks, yet existing evaluations largely focus on final task success, providing limited insight into how agents retrieve and use code context during problem solving. We introduce ContextBench, a process-oriented evaluation of context retrieval in coding agents. ContextBench consists of 1,136 issue-resolution tasks from 66 repositories across eight programming languages, each augmented with human-annotated gold contexts. We further implement an automated evaluation framework that tracks agent trajectories and measures context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution. Using ContextBench, we evaluate four frontier LLMs and five coding agents. Our results show that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval ("The Bitter Lesson" of coding agents), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process. These contexts offer valuable intermediate signals for guiding LLM reasoning in software tasks. Data and code are available at: https://cioutn.github.io/context-bench/.

Motivation: 后训练数据集包含目标行为之外的隐藏模式（如格式-内容关联、数据策展的隐性偏差），这些模型易捕捉但开发者难以察觉，导致模型出现意外行为（如拒绝特定格式下的真实事实），需系统化方法识别和归因这些问题。

Method: 提出SURF（黑盒运行时检测管道）实时暴露 unintended behaviors，以及TURF（数据追溯工具）将失败行为关联到具体后训练数据块；在Claude 4.5、GPT-5.1、Grok 4.1、Gemini 3和Tülu 3等模型上验证。

Result: 实验显示"块状后训练"导致模型行为 miscalibrated（如对特定格式的问题错误拒绝真实信息），这些行为源于后训练数据块的不平衡或定义不足，且问题普遍存在于前沿模型和开源模型中。

Conclusion: 后训练数据的结构性缺陷（数据块失衡/模糊）是模型意外行为的主因，SURF/TURF为识别和归因此类问题提供了有效框架，强调需优化数据策展以减少虚假相关性。

Abstract: LLM post-training involves many diverse datasets, each targeting a specific behavior. But these datasets encode incidental patterns alongside intended ones: correlations between formatting and content, narrow phrasings across diverse problems, and implicit associations arising from the discrete data curation process. These patterns are often invisible to developers yet salient to models, producing behaviors that surprise their creators, such as rejecting true facts presented in a particular question format. We call this chunky post-training: the model learns spurious correlations as a result of distinct chunks of post-training data. We introduce SURF, a black-box pipeline which surfaces these unintended behaviors at run time, and TURF, a tool that traces these failures back to specific post-training data. Applying these tools to frontier models (Claude 4.5, GPT-5.1, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3) and open models (Tülu 3), we show that chunky post-training produces miscalibrated behaviors, which often result from imbalanced or underspecified chunks of post-training data.

TL;DR: PMD-mean通过均值奖励近似解决PMD中的配分函数估计难题，引入隐式χ²正则化使LLM的强化学习更新更保守稳健，在数学推理任务上实现更优性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 策略镜像下降(PMD)是强化学习的原理性框架，被用于训练Kimi K1.5/K2等先进大语言模型。但其理想闭式更新需要可靠的配分函数估计，这在LLM庞大动作空间且采样受限时构成重大挑战。

Method: 提出实用算法PMD-mean：用采样策略下的均值奖励近似对数配分项，并在对数策略空间执行回归。通过分析其总体解，证明其隐式优化带自适应混合KL-χ²正则化的镜像下降子问题。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，PMD-mean相比基线方法实现了更优性能，同时提升了训练稳定性与时间效率。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对PMD-mean的理论理解，揭示了其在有限样本下的鲁棒性机制，为LLM强化学习的原理性改进提供了理论路径。

Abstract: Policy mirror descent (PMD) provides a principled framework for reinforcement learning (RL) by iteratively solving KL-regularized policy improvement subproblems. While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$χ^2$ regularizer. This additional $χ^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.

*Sudeepta Mondal,Xinyi Mary Xie,Ruxiao Duan,Alex Wong,Ganesh Sundaramoorthi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the neglected problem of tuning out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors without an OOD dataset, showing that current methods suffer from performance variance based on adhoc dataset choice, and proposes a generic approach that requires only neural network training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detectors rely on separate adhoc OOD datasets for tuning, which may be unavailable or unrepresentative of actual OOD data (''unknown unknowns''), causing significant performance variance and limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The paper formalizes the OOD detector tuning problem without OOD datasets, establishes strong baselines, and introduces a generic tuning approach that uses only neural network training data, eliminating the need for external OOD datasets.

Result: The proposed approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across higher-parameter OOD detector families while maintaining comparable performance for lower-parameter families, demonstrating robust effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses a critical gap in OOD detection by providing practical methods that remove dependency on external OOD datasets, improving reliability and deployability of OOD detectors in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors are often tuned by a separate dataset deemed OOD with respect to the training distribution of a neural network (NN). OOD detectors process the activations of NN layers and score the output, where parameters of the detectors are determined by fitting to an in-distribution (training) set and the aforementioned dataset chosen adhocly. At detector training time, this adhoc dataset may not be available or difficult to obtain, and even when it's available, it may not be representative of actual OOD data, which is often ''unknown unknowns." Current benchmarks may specify some left-out set from test OOD sets. We show that there can be significant variance in performance of detectors based on the adhoc dataset chosen in current literature, and thus even if such a dataset can be collected, the performance of the detector may be highly dependent on the choice. In this paper, we introduce and formalize the often neglected problem of tuning OOD detectors without a given ``OOD'' dataset. To this end, we present strong baselines as an attempt to approach this problem. Furthermore, we propose a new generic approach to OOD detector tuning that does not require any extra data other than those used to train the NN. We show that our approach improves over baseline methods consistently across higher-parameter OOD detector families, while being comparable across lower-parameter families.

TL;DR: 该论文提出基于黎曼几何的降维方法，特别是主测地线分析(PGA)，用于处理流形结构数据，在超球面和对称正定流形等弯曲空间上相比欧氏方法展现出更优的表示质量和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降维方法假设数据位于欧氏空间，但实际数据常分布在弯曲流形上。欧氏方法无法尊重数据的内在几何结构，因此需要开发几何感知的降维方法。

Method: 研究基于黎曼几何的降维方法，包括主测地线分析(PGA)作为PCA在流形上的非线性推广，以及判别分析的黎曼扩展。这些方法利用测地线距离、切空间表示和内在统计度量来获得更忠实低维嵌入。

Result: 在代表性数据集上的实验结果表明，黎曼方法相比欧氏对应方法提供了改进的表示质量和分类性能，特别适用于约束在弯曲空间（如超球面和对称正定流形）上的数据。

Conclusion: 在现代机器学习和数据科学应用中，考虑几何结构的降维方法至关重要，应优先选择尊重数据内在流形结构的算法。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate Riemannian geometry based dimensionality reduction methods that respect the underlying manifold structure of the data. In particular, we focus on Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) as a nonlinear generalization of PCA for manifold valued data, and extend discriminant analysis through Riemannian adaptations of other known dimensionality reduction methods. These approaches exploit geodesic distances, tangent space representations, and intrinsic statistical measures to achieve more faithful low dimensional embeddings. We also discuss related manifold learning techniques and highlight their theoretical foundations and practical advantages. Experimental results on representative datasets demonstrate that Riemannian methods provide improved representation quality and classification performance compared to their Euclidean counterparts, especially for data constrained to curved spaces such as hyperspheres and symmetric positive definite manifolds. This study underscores the importance of geometry aware dimensionality reduction in modern machine learning and data science applications.

Method: 1. 基于正交微调（OFT）将任务特定正交矩阵映射到李代数进行流形合并 2. 通过正交-残差解耦策略扩展至非OFT微调模型：求解正交Procrustes问题提取正交分量进行流形合并，线性残差采用标准加法合并

Result: 在多样化任务中显著减轻灾难性遗忘现象，有效维持模型跨任务性能

Conclusion: OrthoMerge通过保持权重几何结构，为多能力LLM融合提供原则性高效方案，适用于OFT及常规微调模型

Abstract: Merging finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important for integrating diverse capabilities into a single unified model. However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.

*Rajdeep Haldar,Lantao Mei,Guang Lin,Yue Xing,Qifan Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends divergence-based preference alignment to general RL settings, proposing $f$-GRPO and $f$-HAL objectives based on $f$-divergences for LLM alignment, with theoretical guarantees and empirical superiority on math reasoning and safety tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Preference Alignment (PA) objectives are viewed as divergence estimators between response distributions, but this perspective hasn't been extended to general alignment settings like reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). The paper aims to create a unified framework for LLM alignment using divergence-based objectives.

Method: The authors propose two classes of methods: (1) $f$-Group Relative Policy Optimization ($f$-GRPO), an on-policy reinforcement learning approach; (2) $f$-Hybrid Alignment Loss ($f$-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objective. Both leverage variational representations of $f$-divergences to generalize alignment beyond preference data.

Result: Theoretical analysis proves these objectives improve average reward post-alignment. Empirical evaluation on RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA (Safety Alignment) tasks shows superior performance and flexibility over current baseline methods.

Conclusion: The unified divergence-based framework successfully extends alignment to general settings, with $f$-GRPO and $f$-HAL offering both theoretical guarantees and practical improvements, demonstrating the versatility of $f$-divergence formulations for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose $f$-Group Relative Policy Optimization ($f$-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and $f$-Hybrid Alignment Loss ($f$-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of $f$-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.

Abstract: Sampling from a distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-\mathcal{E}(x)}$ known up to a normalising constant is an important and challenging problem in statistics. Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schrödinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time. Lastly, we showcase the application of the proposed diffusion samplers to data-free posterior sampling in the discrete latent spaces of image generative models.

Abstract: Hydraulic systems are widely utilized in industrial applications due to their high force generation, precise control, and ability to function in harsh environments. Hydraulic cylinders, as actuators in these systems, apply force and position through the displacement of hydraulic fluid, but their operation is significantly influenced by friction force. Achieving precision in hydraulic cylinders requires an accurate friction model under various operating conditions. Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation. The algorithm effectively combines feature detection and estimation processes using training data acquired from an experimental hydraulic test setup. It achieves a consistent and stable model error of less than 10% across diverse operating conditions and external load variations, ensuring robust performance in complex situations. The computational cost of the algorithm is 1.51 milliseconds per estimation, making it suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method addresses the limitations of analytical models by delivering high precision and computational efficiency. The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model. The comparison highlights that while the LuGre model offers a theoretical foundation for friction modeling, its performance is limited by its inability to dynamically adjust to varying operational conditions of the hydraulic cylinder, further emphasizing the advantages of the proposed hybrid approach in real-time applications.

Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) on web-scale datasets becomes fundamental for advancing general-purpose AI. In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA) to fix instability of Softmax Self-Attention in skipless Transformers by enforcing orthogonal attention matrices via skew-symmetric matrix exponentials, achieving linear complexity and well-conditioned Jacobians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) causes rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians in skipless Transformer architectures (without skip connections/normalization), leading to training instability and impaired representation learning.

Method: Designs OSA by parametrizing the attention matrix as orthogonal through mapping query-key derived skew-symmetric matrices via the matrix exponential; exploits low-rank structure for efficiency.

Result: OSA achieves linear computational/memory complexity with sequence length and includes an initialization scheme proven to ensure well-conditioned Jacobians.

Conclusion: OSA enables stable training of non-causal Transformers without skip connections or normalization layers, addressing SSA's core instability issues while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) is a key component of Transformer architectures. However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper formalizes compute-bounded policies in reinforcement learning, proving that more compute (separate from parameters) can solve harder problems and generalize better. A minimal variable-compute architecture outperforms standard networks on 31 RL tasks, achieving stronger performance and longer-horizon generalization with up to 5× fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL frameworks conflate compute and parameters through static neural networks, leaving open how additional compute affects learning. The paper seeks to formally understand compute's role and whether fixed-parameter policies can benefit from more computation.

Method: Formalizes compute-bounded policies theoretically, then proposes a minimal architecture from algorithmic learning/model-free planning that can dynamically allocate variable compute. Validates through experiments on 31 online/offline RL tasks.

Result: Architecture with more compute achieves stronger performance and better generalization on longer-horizon tasks compared to feedforward/residual networks using up to 5× more parameters.

Conclusion: Compute is a distinct resource from parameters; policies can benefit from increased compute even with fixed parameters, enabling better problem-solving and generalization beyond standard architectures.

Abstract: How does the amount of compute available to a reinforcement learning (RL) policy affect its learning? Can policies using a fixed amount of parameters, still benefit from additional compute? The standard RL framework does not provide a language to answer these questions formally. Empirically, deep RL policies are often parameterized as neural networks with static architectures, conflating the amount of compute and the number of parameters. In this paper, we formalize compute bounded policies and prove that policies which use more compute can solve problems and generalize to longer-horizon tasks that are outside the scope of policies with less compute. Building on prior work in algorithmic learning and model-free planning, we propose a minimal architecture that can use a variable amount of compute. Our experiments complement our theory. On a set 31 different tasks spanning online and offline RL, we show that $(1)$ this architecture achieves stronger performance simply by using more compute, and $(2)$ stronger generalization on longer-horizon test tasks compared to standard feedforward networks or deep residual network using up to 5 times more parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical proof that sufficient curiosity in Active Inference simultaneously guarantees coherent Bayesian learning and no-regret decision-making, with practical tuning guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active Inference balances exploration/exploitation via Expected Free Energy, but it's unknown how this balance yields both effective learning and efficient decisions—myopic exploitation vs. wasteful exploration.

Method: Established first theoretical guarantees showing sufficient curiosity ensures Bayesian posterior consistency and bounded regret; characterized dependence on uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment; connected AIF to Bayesian experimental design and optimization.

Result: A single "sufficient curiosity" condition guarantees self-consistent learning and no-regret optimization, with explicit characterization of how key parameters affect this mechanism.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical foundation for Active Inference, bridges to classical Bayesian methods, and translates theory into practical design guidelines validated by real-world experiments.

Abstract: Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing the Expected Free Energy (EFE), balancing epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) through a curiosity coefficient. Yet it has been unclear when this balance yields both coherent learning and efficient decision-making: insufficient curiosity can drive myopic exploitation and prevent uncertainty resolution, while excessive curiosity can induce unnecessary exploration and regret. We establish the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that a single requirement--sufficient curiosity--simultaneously ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret). Our analysis characterizes how this mechanism depends on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, thereby connecting AIF to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization within one theoretical framework. We further translate these theories into practical design guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off in hybrid learning-optimization problems, validated through real-world experiments.

Conclusion: AP-OOD通过token级信息利用和半监督灵活性，显著提升了文本OOD检测性能，为可靠部署ML模型提供了有效方案

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which maps high-dimensional data into a scalar OOD score, is critical for the reliable deployment of machine learning models. A key challenge in recent research is how to effectively leverage and aggregate token embeddings from language models to obtain the OOD score. In this work, we propose AP-OOD, a novel OOD detection method for natural language that goes beyond simple average-based aggregation by exploiting token-level information. AP-OOD is a semi-supervised approach that flexibly interpolates between unsupervised and supervised settings, enabling the use of limited auxiliary outlier data. Empirically, AP-OOD sets a new state of the art in OOD detection for text: in the unsupervised setting, it reduces the FPR95 (false positive rate at 95% true positives) from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM summarization, and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr translation.

Conclusion: 环境交互本身不足以让模型获得可泛化的物理直觉，挑战了"交互必然促进物理规律学习"的认知科学假设，揭示当前模型的根本局限性

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models do not have good intuitions about the physical world. Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions. We find that models trained on one task do not reliably generalize to related tasks, even if the tasks share visual statistics and physical principles, and regardless of whether the models are trained through interaction.

Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter ensemble of random discrete-time Markov models that simultaneously captures critical slowing down and broken detailed balance. Extending a previously studied heterogeneous Markov ensemble, we incorporate correlations between forward and backward transition rates through a single asymmetry parameter $γ$, while heterogeneity is controlled by $ε$. Using results from random matrix theory, we identify a critical locus $ε_c(γ,N)$ at which relaxation times diverge and spectral universality breaks down. We characterize the behavior of entropy production, predictive information, and relaxation dynamics across the ensemble, showing that many observables depend strongly on heterogeneity but only weakly on asymmetry, except near the symmetric limit. Applying maximum-likelihood inference to human fMRI and EEG data, we find that both modalities operate near the predicted critical locus and occupy a similar region of the $ε-γ$ plane, supporting a super-universality of human brain dynamics. While ensemble averages are well captured by the null model, empirical data exhibit substantially enhanced variability, indicating subject-specific structure beyond random expectations. Our results unify criticality and nonequilibrium measures within a single framework and clarify their intertwined role in the analysis of complex biological dynamics.

Abstract: Establishing reliable and interpretable structure-property relationships in glasses is a longstanding challenge in condensed matter physics. While modern data-driven machine learning techniques have proven highly effective in establishing structure-property correlations, many models are criticized for lacking physical interpretability and being task-specific. In this work, we identify an approximate linear relation between structure profiles and disorder-induced responses of glass properties based on first order perturbation theory. We analytically demonstrate that this relationship holds universally across glassy systems with varying dimensions and distinct interaction types. This robust theoretical relationship motivates the adoption of linear machine learning models, which we show numerically to achieve surprisingly high predictive accuracy for structure-property mapping in a wide variety of glassy materials. We further devise regularization analysis to further enhance the interpretability of our model, bridging the gap between predictive performance and physical insight. Overall, this linear relation establishes a simple yet powerful connection between structural disorder and spectral properties in glasses, opening a new avenue for advancing their studies.

TL;DR: 该论文采用分布ζ函数方法对连续随机场伊辛模型（RFIM）的弱无序和强无序区进行了非微扰分析，揭示了弱无序下上临界维度移至6且存在最小红外有效作用量，强无序下则无常规临界性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微扰方法难以精确描述随机场伊辛模型（RFIM）在强无序区的非微扰行为，且弱无序区的红外结构特性尚未完全阐明，亟需发展非微扰方法以统一解析其临界行为。

Method: 采用分布ζ函数方法，通过在有效作用量层面完成淬火无序平均，推导出精确的二次项和相互作用项，从而实现对弱/强无序区的非微扰分析。

Result: 弱无序区：物理场分解为具有不同标度维度的关联分量，呈现特征性1/p⁴行为，上临界维度移至d_c⁺=6，临界行为由最小红外有效作用量支配；强无序区：获得含离散质量模谱的精确对角二次作用量，无质量模式导致常规临界性消失，关联函数谱表示在红外区快速收敛。

Conclusion: 该工作首次在RFIM中通过非微扰方法严格证明弱无序区存在d_c⁺=6的新临界维度，并揭示强无序区因质量模式离散化而抑制临界性，为无序系统临界现象提供了统一理论框架。

Abstract: We present a nonperturbative analysis of the weak- and strong-disorder regimes of the continuous random-field Ising model using the distributional zeta-function method. By performing the quenched-disorder average at the level of the effective action, we derive exact quadratic and interaction terms. In the weak-disorder limit, we show that the infrared structure of the two-point correlation functions yields a decomposition of the physical field into correlated components with distinct scaling dimensions. This mechanism exhibits the characteristic $1/p^4$ behavior, which shifts the upper critical dimension to $d_c^{+}=6$. The universal critical behavior of the RFIM near this dimension is governed by a minimal infrared effective action. In the strong-disorder regime, we obtain an exact diagonal quadratic action with a discrete spectrum of massive modes. Here, the absence of massless modes implies the absence of conventional criticality. The resulting spectral representation of correlation functions converges rapidly and remains well controlled in the infrared regime.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数方法难以捕捉计数数据中的复杂非线性依赖，而高斯过程回归虽稳健但只能生成连续输出，无法处理离散非负的整数计数问题

Method: 构建PoLoN过程：使用高斯过程建模泊松分布的对数比率，通过核函数捕获数据点间相关性；推导预测分布为Poisson-LogNormal；提供核超参数优化算法；扩展应用于在平滑背景上检测微弱局部信号

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据集（包括CERN希格斯玻色子探测开源数据集）上验证有效，能够预测信号强度、位置和宽度

Conclusion: PoLoN过程可作为分析、预测和从整数值数据中提取信号的有效非参数替代方法

Abstract: Modeling count data is important in physics and other scientific disciplines, where measurements often involve discrete, non-negative quantities such as photon or neutrino detection events. Traditional parametric approaches can be trained to generate integer-count predictions but may struggle with capturing complex, non-linear dependencies often observed in the data. Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a robust non-parametric alternative to modeling continuous data; however, it cannot generate integer outputs. We propose the Poisson Log-Normal (PoLoN) process, a framework that employs GP to model Poisson log-rates. As in GP regression, our approach relies on the correlations between data points captured via GP kernel structure rather than explicit functional parameterizations. We demonstrate that the PoLoN predictive distribution is Poisson-LogNormal and provide an algorithm for optimizing kernel hyperparameters. Furthermore, we adapt the PoLoN approach to the problem of detecting weak localized signals superimposed on a smoothly varying background - a task of considerable interest in many areas of science and engineering. Our framework allows us to predict the strength, location and width of the detected signals. We evaluate PoLoN's performance using both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the open dataset from CERN which was used to detect the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider. Our results indicate that the PoLoN process can be used as a non-parametric alternative for analyzing, predicting, and extracting signals from integer-valued data.

Abstract: Despite extensive study, the phase structure of the wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAF) is not yet systematically characterized. In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.

TL;DR: 发现双梯t-J-J⊥模型中存在一种具有非周期对密度波(iC-PDW)关联的广义Luther-Emery液相，通过调节梯间势能和极化强度，结合DMRG和玻色化分析，揭示了在有限极化下出现自旋能隙相，其层间和层内配对关联分别以不同周期振荡，该态在较宽参量范围内稳定，并与镍酸盐超导体相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强关联电子系统中的新奇量子态，特别是在梯状结构中寻找可能存在于高温超导体（如双层镍酸盐La₃Ni₂O₇）中的对密度波相。通过理论模型研究层间耦合和极化调控下的配对机制。

Method: 采用密度矩阵重整化群(DMRG)数值模拟与玻色化解析分析相结合的方法，研究具有层间跃迁和交换作用的两条t-J-J⊥梯子模型，通过调节两梯间的势能差来调控层极化强度P。

Result: 在中等层极化强度下发现了一个自旋能隙打开的新物相，其同时存在层间和层内的振荡配对关联：层间关联呈现类似FFLO的振荡模式，周期由两梯费米面失配决定；层内关联源于一梯电荷与另一梯自旋涨落的耦合，动量等于对侧梯费米动量的两倍。该iC-PDW相对掺杂和极化具有鲁棒性，但会被强层间跃迁破坏而转向4e电荷关联态。

Conclusion: 该广义Luther-Emery液相代表了一种新的量子物态，其非周期对密度波特征为理解层状超导材料中的配对机制提供了新视角，并可在光学格子实验平台实现，对解释双层镍酸盐La₃Ni₂O₇的超导现象具有重要意义。

Abstract: We report the discovery of a generalized Luther-Emery liquid phase characterized by incommensurate pair-density-wave (iC-PDW) correlations in the two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_\perp$ ladder model. By tuning the potential difference between the legs, we explore the regime of intermediate layer polarization $P$. Combining density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with bosonization analysis, we identify a spin-gapped phase at finite $P$, where the interlayer and intralayer pair correlations both oscillate, but with distinct periodicities. The interlayer correlations exhibit FFLO-like oscillations, driven by pairing between layers with mismatched Fermi momenta, with a period determined by their momentum difference. In contrast, the intralayer pair correlations arise from the coupling between charges on one layer and spin fluctuations on the opposite layer, with a momentum equal to twice the Fermi momentum of the opposite layer. The iC-PDW state is robust across a wide range of doping and polarization, although finite interlayer hopping eventually destabilizes it toward a state with charge-$4e$ correlations. We conclude by discussing the experimental realization of this model in optical lattice platforms and its relevance to the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Result: 获得特征频率ω_⋆∼k_B T/ħ处的普适效率边界；发现普朗克散射体处于最优临界点，其弛豫速率达到信息-耗散效率崩溃前的最大值，表明奇异金属是生成可区分变化的最快且仍保持效率的体系

Conclusion: 该边界可通过强关联电子系统的光学电导率测量直接验证，为理解耗散如何产生可区分变化提供了独特实验窗口，揭示了奇异金属在量子耗散中的极限性能

Abstract: We derive a universal bound on the efficiency with which "dissipated" work can generate distinguishable changes in a quantum many-body state at a finite temperature, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information. The bound follows solely from the analytic structure of equilibrium many-body correlators and is independent of all microscopic details. It takes a frequency-resolved form with a characteristic crossover at the Planckian scale, $ω_\star\sim k_B T/\hbar$. We find that Planckian scatterers sit at the edge of optimality, displaying maximal relaxation rate before information-dissipation efficiency collapses. This suggests strange metals are not just fast dissipators, but the fastest that remain efficient in generating distinguishability. The bounded quantity can be evaluated directly from optical conductivity measurements in strongly correlated electronic systems, offering a unique window into how dissipation generates distinguishable changes.

Abstract: We present lrux, a JAX-based software package for fast low-rank updates of determinants and Pfaffians, targeting the dominant computational bottleneck in various quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms. The package implements efficient low-rank updates that reduce the cost of successive wavefunction evaluations from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$ when the update rank $k$ is smaller than the dimension $n$ of matrices. Both determinant and Pfaffian updates are supported, together with delayed-update strategies that trade floating-point operations for reduced memory traffic on modern accelerators. lrux natively integrates with JAX transformations such as JIT compilation, vectorization, and automatic differentiation, and supports both real and complex data types. Benchmarks on GPUs demonstrate up to $1000\times$ speedup at large matrix sizes. lrux enables scalable, high-performance evaluation of antisymmetric wavefunctions and is designed as a drop-in component for a wide range of QMC workflows. lrux is available at https://github.com/ChenAo-Phys/lrux.

Result: 无自旋-轨道耦合时，斯格明子和双子晶体产生沿磁化方向极化的自旋流，而半子晶体不产生自旋流；引入自旋-轨道耦合后，半子晶体产生显著的面外极化自旋流，源于增强的自旋Berry曲率；各纹理的输运性质由其磁对称性决定。

Conclusion: 拓扑自旋纹理可作为高效自旋流源，即使零净磁化的半子晶体也能产生强自旋流，这为基于拓扑磁性金属的自旋电子学器件设计提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Spin current offers a promising route toward energy-efficient and high-speed information processing. Developing efficient methods for their generation remains a central challenge in spintronics. Here, we investigate spin current generation via two-dimensional topological spin textures: a skyrmion crystal (SkX) with out-of-plane magnetization, a bimeron crystal (BmX) with in-plane magnetization, and a meron crystal (MX) with zero net magnetization. We show that these distinct spin textures generate spin currents with characteristic spin polarization directions. In the absence of spin--orbit coupling, the SkX and BmX generate spin currents polarized along their magnetization directions, whereas the MX yields no spin current. Upon introducing spin--orbit coupling, while the behavior of the SkX does not qualitatively change, the BmX generates nonzero spin currents in multiple polarization directions. Notably, the MX, despite its zero net magnetization, exhibits a pronounced spin current with out-of-plane spin polarization, driven by an enhanced spin Berry curvature associated with characteristic band degeneracy. We further demonstrate that the electronic and spin transport properties of each texture are governed by their magnetic symmetries. Our results highlight the topological spin textures as efficient sources of spin current even without net magnetization, expanding the design for spintronics devices based on topological magnetic metals.

Conclusion: 该双层镍酸盐的基态由竞争性键对角相互作用、自旋 disproportionation 和潜在晶格不稳定性共同决定，这些特征为理解镍酸盐超导机制提供了关键要素。

Abstract: A comprehensive spectroscopic map of the electronic, magnetic, and lattice excitations is presented for the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using Raman scattering at ambient pressure. Upon entering the spin density wave state below 153 K, the $A_{1g}$ channel exhibits an abrupt electronic spectral gap with a clear isosbestic point. In contrast, the $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ channels are dominated by pronounced two-magnon (2M) excitations, representing an unambiguous signature of incipient Mottness. These 2M signals in both channels constitute direct evidence for two distinct in-plane spin exchange interactions along the Ni-O bonding and its diagonal directions. Calculations based on the spin wave theory further reveal that the 2M mode in the $B_{2g}$ channel arises from the competition between two bond-diagonal antiferromagnetic interactions mediated by nickel $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Furthermore, emergent low-energy 2M excitations below 10 meV are found to originate from distinct, weaker spin moments, strongly supporting spin disproportionation. Simultaneously, an anomalous softening of $B_{1g}$ phonons from 280 down to 4.5 K is uncovered, suggesting the presence of an incipient lattice instability leading to checkerboard-type breathing modulations. Collectively, these findings identify a ground state of the bilayer nickelate characterized by competing bond-diagonal interactions, spin disproportionation, and an incipient lattice instability, establishing key ingredients for understanding the mechanism of nickelate superconductivity.

Conclusion: 该体系中增强的热霍尔效应源于电荷'汤团'对声子的电声子耦合作用，这一机制成功解释了观测到的效应大小和特征磁场依赖性。

Abstract: We present the experimental observation of a drastically enhanced thermal Hall effect in the topological insulator material TlBi$_{0.15}$Sb$_{0.85}$Te$_2$. Although heat transport is dominated by phonons, moderate magnetic fields generate a thermal Hall ratio ($κ_{xy}/κ_{xx}$) above 2\%, an unprecedented value for a nonmagnetic material. The transverse thermal conductivity $κ_{xy}$ exhibits a pronounced maximum in fields of a few Tesla. This characteristic field dependence allows us to identify the microscopic origin of the thermal Hall effect in this system. Small densities of charged impurities induce locally conducting regions, so-called charge puddles, within the bulk insulating matrix. Via electron-phonon coupling, these charge puddles imprint a large thermal Hall effect onto the phonons accounting for both the magnitude and the magnetic-field dependence of the observed effect.

Conclusion: MCA能有效处理多轨道杂质问题，特别适用于无需完整DMFT自洽循环的性质评估，且能描述非平衡条件下偏压驱动的轨道电荷转移现象。

Abstract: We present the mixed-configuration approximation (MCA) based on the auxiliary master equation approach impurity solver to study multiorbital correlated systems under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We benchmark the method for bulk and layered SrVO$_3$ in equilibrium and apply it to a prototypical nonequilibrium geometry in which a voltage bias is applied perpendicular to the layer via reservoirs held at different chemical potentials. For bulk SrVO$_3$, MCA reproduces the metallic state at moderate interaction strengths, but it overestimates the weight of the lower band relative to quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and fork tensor product state (FTPS) solvers. With respect to QMC and FTPS, MCA yields an earlier metal-to-insulator transition as the electron-electron interaction is increased. In layered SrVO$_3$ at equilibrium, MCA partially captures the orbital polarization in favor of the in-plane $xy$ orbital, although not as strong as in the DMFT-converged results obtained with QMC. However, when performing a one-shot impurity calculation initialized with the DFMT-QMC results, MCA yields orbital occupations which show a stronger charge polarization in favor of orbital $xy$. This suggests that our approach can be used to study multiorbital impurity problems when the focus is to assess properties without performing the full DMFT self-consistent loop. Finally, under applied bias, we observe a pronounced redistribution of orbital occupations, demonstrating that the method captures bias-driven orbital charge transfer in realistic materials in nonequilibrium conditions.

Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics induced by an interaction quench in the semiclassical Holstein model within the Ehrenfest nonadiabatic framework, which describes an isolated hybrid quantum-classical system with strictly conserved total energy. Focusing on the half-filled case, where the equilibrium ground state exhibits commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) order for any nonzero coupling, we identify three distinct post-quench dynamical regimes as a function of the final electron-phonon coupling: a nonequilibrium metallic state without CDW order, an intermediate regime characterized by slow scale-invariant ordering dynamics, and a frozen CDW state with arrested coarsening and immobile kinks. We analyze the intermediate regime in detail and uncover an unconventional algebraic decay of the kink density, $n \sim t^{-1/3}$, distinct from both ballistic annihilation and diffusive coarsening in classical dissipative systems. We show that this anomalous exponent arises from the hybrid nature of the dynamics: while the lattice evolves deterministically, the electronic degrees of freedom act as an effective internal bath that induces diffusive kink motion without energy dissipation. An effective reaction-diffusion description, incorporating both annihilation and elastic scattering of kinks, quantitatively accounts for the observed scaling behavior. Our results reveal a distinct coarsening mechanism in isolated hybrid systems, demonstrating how internal quantum dynamics can qualitatively reshape defect kinetics far from equilibrium.

Abstract: Altermagnets provide a natural platform for studying and exploiting piezomagnetism. In this paper, we introduce a class of insulating altermagnets in two dimensions (2D) referred to as Dirac quadrupole altermagnets, and show based on microscopic minimal models that the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability of such altermagnets has a topological contribution described by topological response theory. The essential low-energy electronic structure of Dirac quadrupole altermagnets can be understood from a gapless parent phase (i.e., the Dirac quadrupole semimetal), which has important implications for their response to external fields. Focusing on the strain-induced response, here we demonstrate that the topological piezomagnetic effect is a consequence of the way in which strain affects the Dirac points forming a quadrupole. We consider two microscopic models: a spinless two-band model describing a band inversion of $s$ and $d$ states, and a Lieb lattice model with collinear Néel order. The latter is a prototypical minimal model for altermagnetism in 2D and is realized in a number of recently proposed material compounds, which are discussed.

Conclusion: 费舍尔零点、动力学和激发之间的深刻联系为理解强关联多体系统中的非常规能隙行为开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We demonstrate an alternative approach based on complex-valued inverse temperature and partition function to probe quantum phases of matter with nontrivial spectra and dynamics. It leverages thermofield dynamics (TFD) to quantitatively characterize quantum and thermal fluctuations, and exploit the correspondence between low-energy excitations and Fisher zeros. Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid. We identify this energy scale and relate the motion of these giant bubbles with varying external field to the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies. The deep connection between Fisher zeros, dynamics, and excitations opens up promising avenues for understanding the unconventional gap behaviors in strongly correlated many-body systems.
