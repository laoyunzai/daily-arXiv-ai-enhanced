Although previous studies have predominantly focused on\nthe collective properties of the PC, the dynamics of individual clusters and\ntheir inter-cluster interactions remain largely unexplored. Here, we\ndemonstrate that multiple clusters emerge and coexist, forming a hierarchical\npattern known as the Devil's Staircase. We identify three key findings by\ninvestigating individual cluster dynamics and inter-cluster interactions.\nFirst, the PC persistently suppresses the formation of SCs during its growth\nand even after it has fully formed, revealing the significant impact of\ninter-cluster interactions on cluster formation. Second, once established, SCs\ninduce higher-order clusters exhibiting frequency resonance via inter-cluster\ninteractions, resulting in the Devil's Staircase pattern. Third, sufficiently\nlarge SCs can destabilize and fragment the PC, highlighting the bidirectional\nnature of cluster interactions. We develop a coarse-grained Kuramoto model that\ntreats each cluster as a macroscopic oscillator to capture these inter-cluster\ndynamics and the resulting phenomena. Our work marks a significant step beyond\nsystem-wide averages in the study of inertial oscillator systems, offering new\ninsights into the rich dynamics of cluster formation and synchronization in\nreal-world applications such as power grid networks."}

The correct order parameter is\n$z_k=\\sqrt{\\bigl|\\,m_k^2-|m_{k,c}|^2\\,\\bigr|}$, where $m_k$ is the $k^{th}$\nFourier component of the magnetization m(t), and $m_{k,c}$ is the $k^{th}$\nFourier component at the critical period. Using high-accuracy limit-cycle\nintegration and Fourier analysis, we first confirm that, for periodic fields\nthat contain only odd components, the symmetry-broken branch below $P_c$\nexhibits $z_k \\propto \\varepsilon^{1/2}$ (computationally tested for modes\n$k\\le30$), where $\\varepsilon=(P_c-P)/P_c$.

A gold-NaCl system with symmetric and\nasymmetric electrode configurations is used to analyze the flow patterns under\nhigh-frequency AC potentials.

An order parameter\nanalysis explained that the heat generation is due to the periodic change in\nthe alignment of water molecules under AC potential and that at these high\nfrequencies the influence of Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions are negligible. The heat\ngeneration and temperature gradient are found to increase with the applied AC\nfrequency. Three different electrode configurations were studied by varying the\nsize and distance between the electrodes. A net directional flow develops in\nthe asymmetric electrode structures. A possible mechanism for this is proposed\nby analyzing the flow patterns using velocity and temperature profiles, order\nparameters, streamline plots and mean square displacements.

The Kerr rotation associated with orbital\naccumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc\nelectric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In\ncontrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced\nchange to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual\nmirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our\ncalculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric\nfield modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers\nfrom the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry\nbreaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the\nrelative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are\ncomparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and\n$p$ polarized light, $\\theta_K^s$ and $\\theta_K^p$.

Using the QEC simulation package STIM, repetition code\ncircuits on rotated surface codes were generated, sampled, and analyzed from\ndistances 3 to 17, with various defective error rates and outlier defect\nlocations. In addition, we simulated heterogeneous noise models using the same\nparameters to test how increasingly deviated distributions of physical errors\nscale across code distances under realistic, heterogeneous noise models that\nare informed by current superconducting hardware. The results suggest that\nthere are, in fact, boundaries of acceptable defectiveness in which a defective\nqubit, with a physical error rate $<= .75$\\%, can be left in the lattice with\nnegligible impact on logical error rate given sufficient code distances and\nproper placement in the lattice. On the other hand, we find that substantial\nqubit variation around a seemingly acceptable physical error rate can severely\ndegrade logical qubit performance. As a result, we propose that defectiveness\nof both individual qubits and the overall uniformity of lattice fidelity should\nnot be viewed as all or nothing, but instead as a spectrum.

In particular, for certain\nexamples, we identify effectively classical IMs that admit an efficient Monte\nCarlo algorithm for computing multitime correlations. In more generic settings\nwithout an explicit classical description of the IM, we introduce an\noperational measure of quantum memory with an experimental protocol, and\ndiscuss examples exhibiting long-time genuinely quantum correlations.

After an introduction to various aspects of quantum measurements, and an\nearlier work based on gaussian measurements, which showed the impossibility of\ndetermining the unknown state by such repeated measurements, we present the\ncurrent work based on martingale properties of certain quantities along the\ntrajectory and their convergence from martingale convergence theorems. The main\nresult is that asymptotically all trajectories approach either non degenerate\neigenstates or density matrices spanned by the degenerate eigenstates. A\nunified treatment of both the degenerate and non degenerate cases is given with\nthe help of higher dimensional projectors. The Luders prescription is\nreproduced for the degenerate case. The distribution of trajectories is shown\nto be given by the Born rule. Similar conclusions had already been reached by\nBauer et al as well as by Amini et al. A detailed comparison of the three\napproaches is given. All the three avoid using stochastic differential\nequations. Alter and Yamamoto were the first to investigate repeated\nmeasurements on single copies. We make a detailed comparison with their works\ntoo. We end with a brief discussion of the robustness of the results against\nfree evolutions as well as some anti-Zeno aspects of the results."}

Here, we measure quantum features in the heat transfer between a\nqubit and a thermal bath in a system formed of a driven flux qubit galvanically\ncoupled to a $\\lambda/4$ coplanar-waveguide resonator that is coupled to a heat\nreservoir. This thermal bath is a normal-metal mesoscopic resistor, whose\ntemperature can be measured and controlled. We detect interference patterns in\nthe heat current due to driving-induced coherence. In particular, resonance\npeaks in the heat transferred to the bath are found at driving frequencies\nwhich are integer fractions of the resonator frequency. A selection rule on the\neven/odd parity of the peaks holds at the qubit symmetry point. We present a\ntheoretical model based on Floquet theory that captures the experimental\nresults. The studied system provides a platform for studying the role of\ncoherence in quantum thermodynamics. Our work opens the possibility to\ndemonstrate a true quantum thermal machine where heat is measured directly."}

Valuable\ninsight comes from examining how few-body correlations manifest in many-body\nsystems, embodying the ``from few to many'' philosophy. An intriguing example\nis the set of universal relations in ultracold atomic gases, which connect a\nwide range of observables to a single quantity known as the contact. In this\nLetter, we demonstrate that universal relations manifest in a distinct class of\nquantum many-body systems, long-range quantum spin chains, which belong to a\ncompletely new universality class. Using effective field theory and the\noperator product expansion, we establish connections between the asymptotic\nbehavior of equal-time spin correlation functions, the dynamical structure\nfactor, and the contact density. The theoretical predictions for equal-time\ncorrelators are explicitly verified through numerical simulations based on\nmatrix product states. Our results could be readily tested in state-of-the-art\ntrapped-ion systems."}

This\nall-optical coherent control of solid-state two-level systems is crucial for\nquantum applications. In this work we study Rabi oscillations emerging in a\nWSe2 monolayer-based quantum dot. The emitter is driven coherently using\npicosecond laser pulses to a higher-energy state, while photoluminescence is\nprobed from the ground state. The theoretical treatment based on a three-level\nexciton model reveals the population transfer between the exciton ground and\nexcited states coupled by Coulomb interaction. Our calculations demonstrate\nthat the resulting exciton ground state population can be controlled by varying\ndriving pulse area and detuning which is evidenced by the experimental data.\nOur results pave the way towards the coherent control of quantum emitters in\natomically thin semiconductors, a crucial ingredient for monolayer-based\nhigh-performance, on-demand single photon sources."}

In\nprinciple, arbitrary site-dependent potentials can also be implemented;\nhowever, since lattice spacings are typically below the diffraction limit,\nprecisely applying and calibrating these potentials remains challenging. Here,\nwe propose a simple and efficient experimental protocol that can be used to\nmeasure any potential with high precision. The key ingredient in our protocol\nis the ability in some atomic species to turn off interactions using a Feshbach\nresonance, which makes the evolution easy to compute. Given this, we\ndemonstrate that collecting snapshots from the time evolution of a known,\neasily prepared initial state is sufficient to accurately estimate the\npotential. Our protocol is robust to state preparation errors and uncertainty\nin the hopping rate. This paves the way toward precision quantum simulation\nwith arbitrary potentials."}
