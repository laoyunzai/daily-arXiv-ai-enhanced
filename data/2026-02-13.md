Abstract: We identify fundamental limitations in machine learning by demonstrating that non-trivial mixed-state phases of matter are computationally hard to learn. Focusing on unsupervised learning of distributions, we show that autoregressive neural networks fail to learn global properties of distributions characterized by locally indistinguishable (LI) states. We demonstrate that conditional mutual information (CMI) is a useful diagnostic for LI: we show that for classical distributions, long-range CMI of a state implies a spatially LI partner. By introducing a restricted statistical query model, we prove that nontrivial phases with long-range CMI, such as strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking phases, are hard to learn. We validate our claims by using recurrent, convolutional, and Transformer neural networks to learn the syndrome and physical distributions of toric/surface code under bit flip noise. Our findings suggest hardness of learning as a diagnostic tool for detecting mixed-state phases and transitions and error-correction thresholds, and they suggest CMI and more generally ``non-local Gibbsness'' as metrics for how hard a distribution is to learn.

### [2] [Krylov space perturbation theory for quantum synchronization in closed systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11431)
*Nicolas Loizeau,Berislav Buča*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: Closed disordered Heisenberg spin chains exhibit disorder-induced spatial synchronization and ergodicity breaking via fragmentation of global dynamical symmetry into local symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies of quantum synchronization focused on open systems; this work investigates synchronization as a mechanism for ergodicity breaking in *closed* quantum many-body systems, motivated by understanding non-trivial dynamics and thermalization avoidance.

Method: Analyzed a closed disordered Heisenberg spin chain using Krylov space perturbation theory, varying disorder strength to study symmetry breaking (permutation symmetry) and dynamical symmetry (S⁺) evolution.

Result: (1) Strong disorder breaks permutation symmetry, causing spatial synchronization (spins lock into locally synchronized patches) interpreted as fragmentation of global symmetry S⁺ into local dynamical symmetries. (2) Weak disorder preserves coherent oscillations via second-order Krylov space corrections to S⁺ frequency. (3) Strong disorder gives S⁺ a finite lifetime, creating transient dynamical symmetries.

Conclusion: Disorder in closed quantum systems can induce ergodicity breaking through synchronization, realized by symmetry fragmentation. This provides a mechanism for avoiding thermalization and demonstrates the emergence of transient dynamical symmetries under strong disorder.

Abstract: Strongly interacting quantum many-body systems are expected to thermalize, however, some evade thermalization due to symmetries. Quantum synchronization provides one such example of ergodicity breaking, but previous studies have focused on open systems. Here, motivated by the problem of ergodicity breaking in closed systems and the study of non-trivial dynamics, we investigate synchronization in a closed disordered Heisenberg spin chain. In the presence of large random disorder, strongly breaking the permutation symmetry of the system, we observe the emergence of spatial synchronization, where spins lock into locally synchronized patches. This behavior can be interpreted as a fragmentation of the global dynamical symmetry $S^+$ into a collection of local dynamical symmetries, each characterized by a distinct frequency. In the weak-disorder regime, still without permutation symmetry, we show that the synchronization mechanism can be understood perturbatively within Krylov space. In the absence of disorder, the Krylov space associated with the dynamical symmetry $S^+$ is two-dimensional. Introducing disorder couples this subspace to the remainder of the Krylov space. This coupling leads only to a second-order correction to the frequency of the dynamical symmetry, thereby preserving coherent oscillations despite the presence of small disorder. At stronger disorder, the perturbation modifies $S^+$ so that it acquires a finite lifetime, providing an example of a transient dynamical symmetry.

### [3] [Ultra-Fast 3D Porous Media Generation: a GPU- Accelerated List-Indexed Explicit Time-Stepping QSGS Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11734)
*Ruofan Wang,Mohammed Al-Kobaisi*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: 针对数字岩石物理中高分辨率合成微观结构生成效率低下的问题，本文提出了一种改进的QSGS算法——LIETS，通过限制随机生长操作到显式活动前沿，并结合种子间距控制和方向生长概率优化，在消费级GPU上实现了显著加速，同时保持了物理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字岩石物理领域，高效生成高分辨率合成微观结构至关重要，但经典的QSGS算法在处理大型三维网格时计算成本过高，变得不切实际。

Method: 本文开发了一种列表索引显式时间步进（LIETS）的QSGS公式，该方法将随机生长操作限制在显式活动前沿而非整个体素网格。使用Python的NumPy（CPU）和CuPy（GPU）实现，并引入了通过菱形膨胀实现的种子间距控制以及依赖于体积分数的方向生长概率。

Result: 在400^3域上，LIETS将生成时间从串行CPU实现的数十分钟、向量化CPU和GPU QSGS的数分钟缩短至约24秒（在RTX 4060上），峰值吞吐量达2.7×10^7节点/秒。500^3分辨率的Fontainebleau砂岩基准测试显示，LIETS能重现孔隙和颗粒尺寸分布对种子间距的依赖性（最优s=30体素），并获得与实验范围一致且与先前Fast-QSGS结果相符的渗透率-孔隙度趋势。

Conclusion: LIETS显著加速了QSGS算法，同时保持了物理保真度，使其能够高效处理大型三维微观结构生成问题，为数字岩石物理研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Efficient generation of high-resolution synthetic microstructures is essential in digital rock physics, yet classical Quartet Structure Generation Set (QSGS) algorithms become prohibitively expensive on large three-dimensional grids. We develop a list-indexed explicit time-stepping (LIETS) formulation of QSGS that restricts stochastic growth operations to an explicit active front instead of the entire voxel grid. The method is implemented in Python using NumPy on CPUs and CuPy on GPUs, and incorporates seed-spacing control via diamond dilation together with a volume-fraction-dependent directional growth probability. For a 400^3 domain, LIETS reduces generation time from tens of minutes for a serial CPU implementation and several minutes for vectorized CPU and GPU QSGS to about 24 s on a consumer-grade RTX 4060, achieving peak throughputs up to 2.7x10^7 nodes/s. A Fontainebleau sandstone benchmark at 500^3 resolution shows that LIETS reproduces the dependence of pore and grain size distributions on seed spacing (optimal s=30 voxels) and yields permeability-porosity trends within the experimental envelope and consistent with previously published Fast-QSGS results.

Conclusion: 该范式为设计通用逻辑门和探究非平衡热力学性能奠定基础，提供了热力学变换与资源需求的自然描述。

Abstract: Smartphones, laptops, and data centers are CMOS-based technologies that ushered our world into the information age of the 21st century. Despite their advantages for scalable computing, their implementations come with surprisingly large energetic costs. This challenge has revitalized scientific and engineering interest in energy-efficient information-processing designs. One current paradigm -- dynamical computing -- controls the location and shape of minima in potential energy landscapes that are connected to a thermal environment. The landscape supports distinguishable metastable energy minima that serve as a system's mesoscopic memory states. Information is represented by microstate distributions. Dynamically manipulating the memory states then corresponds to information processing. This framing provides a natural description of the associated thermodynamic transformations and required resources. Appealing to bifurcation theory, a computational protocol in the metastable regime can be analyzed by tracking the evolution of fixed points in the state space. We illustrate the paradigm's capabilities by performing 1-bit and 2-bit computations with double-well and quadruple-well potentials, respectively. These illustrate how dynamical computing can serve as a basis for designing universal logic gates and investigating their out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore both the final state and the intermediate stages of thermal equilibrium between ideal gases separated by heat-conducting walls, which is not typically analyzed in detail.

Method: Classical molecular dynamics simulations of two- and three-region models with argon atoms.

Result: Observed fluctuations, correlations, and temperature distributions showing how heat conduction between regions influences equilibration time.

Conclusion: Provides detailed analysis of intermediate stages leading to thermal equilibrium, validating the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics through molecular dynamics.

Abstract: The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third one, then they are also in equilibrium with each other. This study explores not only the final state of thermal equilibrium between ideal gases separated by heat-conducting walls, but also the intermediate stages leading up to equilibrium, using classical molecular dynamics simulations. Two- and three-region models with argon atoms are analyzed. Fluctuations, correlations, and temperature distributions are observed, highlighting how heat conduction between regions influences the time to reach equilibrium. This work is distinguished by its detailed analysis of the intermediate stages that occur until the system reaches thermal equilibrium, in accordance with the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肿瘤早期集体侵袭可通过单间充质细胞、混合上皮-间充质细胞群或上皮细胞伪足发生，现有计算模型在模拟这些多样化侵袭场景时真实性不足。

Method: 构建包含被动细胞和主动细胞的分数步细胞Potts模型，将具有不同对称性质的机械趋向性（durotaxis）和主动力分别纳入不同的半计算步骤中进行模拟。

Result: 与单步法相比，分数步方法能够产生更真实的细胞侵袭场景，且计算成本增加极少。

Conclusion: 该模型为模拟癌症侵袭提供了更真实的计算框架，未来将整合决定细胞表型分化和增殖的生化机制。

Abstract: The early stages of the collective invasion may occur by single mesenchymal cells or hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal cell groups that detach from cancerous tissue. Tumors may also emit invading protrusions of epithelial cells, which could be led (or not) by a basal cell. Here we devise a fractional step cellular Potts model comprising passive and active cells able to describe these different types of collective invasion before cells start proliferating. Durotaxis and active forces have different symmetry properties and are included in different half steps of the fractional step method. Compared with a single step method, fractional step produces more realistic cellular invasion scenarios with little extra computational effort. Biochemical mechanisms that determine how cells acquire their different phenotypes and cellular proliferation will be incorporated to the model in future publications.

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: 该论文针对惯性活性物质体系，通过微观推导建立了一个通用的连续介质模型，扩展了现有理论框架，并讨论了常用近似方法在惯性系统中的适用性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统活性物质物理主要研究过阻尼粒子体系，而近年来惯性活性系统的实验研究增多，亟需相应的理论模型来描述其非平衡态热力学行为。

Conclusion: 该模型为惯性活性系统提供了统一理论框架，强调在惯性体系中需谨慎使用传统近似方法，为后续研究奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: While active matter physics has traditionally focused on particles with overdamped dynamics, recent years have seen an increase of experimental and theoretical work on active systems with inertia. This also leads to an increased need for theoretical models that describe inertial active dynamics. Here, we present a microscopic derivation for a general continuum model describing the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of inertial active matter that generalizes several previously existing works. It applies to particles with translational and rotational inertia and contains particle density, velocity, angular velocity, temperature, polarization, velocity polarization, and angular velocity polarization as dynamical variables. We moreover discuss to which extend commonly used approximations (factorization and local equilibrium) used in the derivation of hydrodynamic models are applicable to inertial active matter.

### [8] [Topological chiral random walker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12020)
*Saeed Osat,Ellen Meyberg,Jakob Metson,Thomas Speck*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Introduces a topological chiral random walker (TCRW) model that achieves robust edge currents in noisy environments through topological features, enabling superior maze-solving and 80% faster self-assembly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how biological/synthetic systems maintain robust function in noisy environments remains a fundamental challenge; aims to connect robustness with topological features in individual unit dynamics.

Method: Proposes the non-Hermitian TCRW model leveraging bulk-boundary correspondence from condensed matter physics; requires chiral motion and opposite-chirality rotational noise to generate topologically protected edge currents despite defects.

Result: TCRW outperforms diffusive motion in maze navigation by staying on edges; enables self-assembly with ~80% reduced timescales by overcoming diffusion-limited growth bottlenecks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that topological features in dynamic spectra can create robust functionality in noisy systems, offering design principles for efficient synthetic systems like maze-solvers and self-assembling materials.

Abstract: Understanding how biological and synthetic systems achieve robust function in noisy environments remains a fundamental challenge across the physical and life sciences. To connect robust behavior with non-trivial topological features present already in the dynamics of individual units, here we introduce the topological chiral random walker (TCRW) model. While exploring the system, a TCRW locates edges and boundaries in the system and develops topologically protected edge currents even in the presence of defects and disorder. Drawing on the bulk-boundary correspondence found in hard condensed matter systems allows us to rationalize the emergence of robust edge currents through topological features of the dynamic spectrum. We show that chiral motion and rotational noise with opposite chirality are two crucial components in our inherently non-Hermitian model. As proofs of principle, we first show that a topological walker outperforms diffusive motion to efficiently solve complex mazes due to its property of remaining on the edge with some rare detachments. Second, we use this model to design building blocks that can perform efficient self-assembly overcoming the timescale bottlenecks of diffusion-limited growth and reducing self-assembly times by approximately 80%.

### [9] [Charged moments and symmetry-resolved entanglement from Ballistic Fluctuation Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12185)
*Giorgio Li,Léonce Dupays,Paola Ruggiero*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Extends Ballistic Fluctuation Theory to composite twist fields for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies in free fermion systems, validating quench dynamics against quasiparticle conjectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify how entanglement distributes across symmetry sectors in quantum many-body systems with global internal symmetry, requiring generalized entropy measures beyond standard entanglement entropy.

Method: Applies Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT) using height-field formulation of composite branch-point twist fields (with inserted gauge fields) to analyze charged moments' asymptotic correlations.

Result: Derives analytic expressions for charged Rényi entropies in free fermions: (1) at equilibrium in generalized Gibbs ensembles, (2) post-quench from U(1)-symmetric pair-producing states, matching quasiparticle picture predictions.

Conclusion: BFT successfully computes symmetry-resolved entanglement for composite operators, bridging fluctuation theory with quantum information in both equilibrium and dynamical scenarios.

Abstract: The charged moments of a reduced density matrix provide a natural starting point for deriving symmetry-resolved Rényi and entanglement entropies, which quantify how entanglement is distributed among symmetry sectors in the presence of a global internal symmetry in a quantum many-body system. In this work, we study charged moments within the framework of Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT). This theory describes large-scale ballistic fluctuations of conserved charges and associated currents and, by exploiting the height-field formulation of twist fields, gives access to the asymptotic behaviour of their two-point correlation functions. In Del Vecchio Del Vecchio et al. $[1]$, this approach was applied to the special case of branch-point twist fields used to compute entanglement entropies within the replica approach. Here, we extend those results by applying BFT to composite branch-point twist fields, obtained by inserting an additional gauge field. Focusing on free fermions, we derive analytic expressions for charged Rényi entropies both at equilibrium, in generalized Gibbs ensembles, and out of equilibrium following a quantum quench from $U(1)$ preserving pair producing integrable initial states. In the latter case, our results agree with the conjecture arising from the quasiparticle picture.

### [10] [Potential-energy gating for robust state estimation in bistable stochastic systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11712)
*Luigi Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Potential-energy gating is a physics-based robust state estimation method that modulates observation trust by potential energy landscape, achieving 57-80% RMSE improvement in double-well stochastic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a physics-based robust filtering method for double-well stochastic systems that modulates observation trust based on potential energy location, overcoming limitations of statistical robust filters (uniform treatment) and constrained filters (hard bounds).

Method: Potential-energy gating modulates observation noise covariance by local potential energy function value, implemented in EKF, UKF, EnKF, AKF and particle filters with only two additional hyperparameters.

Result: Synthetic benchmarks show 57-80% RMSE improvement over standard EKF (p<10^-15), outperforms naive baseline by ~21 percentage points, remains robust to 50% parameter misspecification (>47% improvement), retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions, and successfully estimates Dansgaard-Oeschger asymmetry parameter gamma=-0.109 (95% CI excludes zero) with outlier fraction explaining 91% of improvement variance.

Conclusion: Potential-energy gating provides significant, robust performance gains for state estimation in double-well systems and demonstrates practical value for real-world applications like climate event analysis.

Abstract: We introduce potential-energy gating, a method for robust state estimation in systems governed by double-well stochastic dynamics. The observation noise covariance of a Bayesian filter is modulated by the local value of a known or assumed potential energy function: observations are trusted when the state is near a potential minimum and progressively discounted as it approaches the barrier separating metastable wells. This physics-based mechanism differs from purely statistical robust filters, which treat all regions of state space identically, and from constrained filters, which impose hard bounds on states rather than modulating observation trust. We implement the gating within Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, and Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters, requiring only two additional hyperparameters. Synthetic benchmarks on a Ginzburg-Landau double-well process with 10% outlier contamination and Monte Carlo validation over 100 replications show 57-80% RMSE improvement over the standard Extended Kalman Filter, all statistically significant (p < 10^{-15}, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). A naive topological baseline using only distance to the nearest well achieves 57%, confirming that the continuous energy landscape adds an additional ~21 percentage points. The method is robust to misspecification: even when assumed potential parameters deviate by 50% from their true values, improvement never falls below 47%. Comparing externally forced and spontaneous Kramers-type transitions, gating retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions whereas the naive baseline degrades to 30%. As an empirical illustration, we apply the framework to Dansgaard-Oeschger events in the NGRIP delta-18O ice-core record, estimating asymmetry parameter gamma = -0.109 (bootstrap 95% CI: [-0.220, -0.011], excluding zero) and demonstrating that outlier fraction explains 91% of the variance in filter improvement.

### [11] [Automated Optimization Modeling via a Localizable Error-Driven Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11164)
*Weiting Liu,Han Wu,Yufei Kuang,Xiongwei Han,Tao Zhong,Jianfeng Feng,Wenlian Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes MIND, an error-driven learning framework for automated optimization modeling via LLMs that addresses data scarcity and sparse reward problems through localized error pattern analysis and dynamic fine-tuning, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing automated optimization modeling approaches where post-training effectiveness is constrained by scarcity of high-quality training data and sparse rewards for difficult problems.

Method: The authors profiled error patterns and identified that modeling errors remain localized to specific semantic segments. They developed MIND framework that constructs a focused, high-density training corpus and uses Dynamic Supervised Fine-Tuning Policy Optimization (DFPO) for localized refinement of difficult problems.

Result: Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MIND consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art automated optimization modeling approaches.

Conclusion: The error-driven, localizable perspective effectively addresses data sparsity and reward issues in optimization modeling, offering a superior alternative to holistic reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Automated optimization modeling via Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to assist complex human decision-making. While post-training has become a pivotal technique to enhance LLMs' capabilities in this domain, its effectiveness is severely constrained by the scarcity and underutilization of high-quality training data. However, through a detailed profiling of error patterns across various problem-response pairs drawn from post-training, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing automated optimization modeling approaches: (L1) the sparsity of error-specific problems and (L2) the sparse rewards associated with difficult problems. We demonstrate that these limitations can result in suboptimal performance in domain-specific post-training for LLMs. To tackle the above two limitations, we propose a novel error-driven learning framework -- namely, auto\textbf{m}ated opt\textbf{i}mization modeli\textbf{n}g via a localizable error-\textbf{d}riven perspective (MIND) -- that customizes the whole model training framework from data synthesis to post-training. MIND is based on our key observation of the unique localizable patterns in error propagation of optimization modelings, that is, modeling errors may remain localized to specific semantic segments and do not propagate throughout the entire solution. Thus, in contrast to holistic reasoning tasks such as mathematical proofs, MIND leverages the construction of a focused, high-density training corpus and proposes \textbf{D}ynamic Supervised \textbf{F}ine-Tuning \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (DFPO) to tackle difficult problems through localized refinement. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MIND consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art automated optimization modeling approaches.

### [12] [KBVQ-MoE: KLT-guided SVD with Bias-Corrected Vector Quantization for MoE Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11184)
*Zukang Xu,Zhixiong Zhao,Xing Hu,Zhixuan Chen,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KBVQ-MoE is a novel vector quantization framework for MoE models that uses KLT-guided SVD for redundancy elimination and bias-corrected output stabilization to achieve ultra-low-bit compression with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models have huge parameter sizes making deployment in resource-constrained environments challenging. Direct vector quantization causes performance degradation due to expert redundancy and output bias amplification.

Method: Integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination via KLT-guided SVD to extract and share dominant weight components across experts; (2) bias-corrected output stabilization by quantizing only expert-specific representations and applying channel-wise affine compensation.

Result: 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves 67.99 average accuracy, nearly matching the FP16 baseline of 68.07, significantly outperforming existing quantization methods.

Conclusion: KBVQ-MoE enables efficient edge deployment of MoE models by achieving ultra-low-bit quantization with minimal performance degradation, preserving accuracy while reducing memory demands.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have achieved great success by significantly improving performance while maintaining computational efficiency through sparse expert activation. However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation. Experiments on various MoE LLMs demonstrate that KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing quantization methods. For example, 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves an average accuracy of 67.99, nearly identical to the FP16 baseline of 68.07, underscoring KBVQ-MoE's potential for efficient deployment on edge devices and other resource-constrained platforms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了LLM训练中梯度信号的高度各向异性：语言结构集中在少数主导谱方向（spike），而上下文信息分布在长尾中。基于此提出了Spectra优化器，通过跟踪并抑制主导的低秩spike子空间而不放大敏感的谱尾部，在LLaMA3 8B模型上实现了30%的训练加速、49.25%的优化器内存节省和1.62%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM训练梯度存在严重的各向异性问题，仅占1.5%方向的spike主导了优化器统计量，通过二阶矩归一化和学习率限制抑制了长尾部分的学习，需要解决这种谱分离问题。

Method: 提出Spectra优化器：1）通过缓存和预热启动的幂迭代跟踪spike子空间；2）应用低秩谱整形抑制主导spike而不放大噪声敏感的长尾；3）具有可忽略的开销和大幅减少的优化器状态内存。

Result: 在LLaMA3 8B（50B tokens）上：达到相同目标损失快30%；每步端到端开销减少0.7%；优化器内存减少49.25%；下游准确率提升1.62%。相比Muon：优化处理速度快5.1倍，最终损失更低，准确率高0.66%。

Conclusion: Spectra优化器有效解决了LLM训练中的梯度各向异性问题，在速度、内存效率和模型性能上均显著优于AdamW和Muon，为大规模语言模型训练提供了高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Gradient signals in LLM training are highly anisotropic: recurrent linguistic structure concentrates energy into a small set of dominant spectral directions, while context specific information resides in a long tail. We show that this spike tail separation persists throughout training, with the spike occupying only about 1.5% of directions yet dominating optimizer statistics. This dominance suppresses tail learning by contracting tail updates through second moment normalization and tightening the globally stable learning rate bound. Motivated by this analysis, we propose Spectra, a spike aware optimizer that suppresses the dominant low rank spike subspace without amplifying the noise sensitive spectral tail. Spectra tracks the spike subspace via cached, warm started power iteration and applies low rank spectral shaping with negligible overhead and substantially reduced optimizer state memory. On LLaMA3 8B trained on 50B tokens, Spectra reaches the same target loss 30% faster than AdamW, reduces per step end to end overhead by 0.7%, cuts optimizer state memory by 49.25%, and improves average downstream accuracy by 1.62%. Compared to Muon, Spectra is 5.1x faster in optimizer processing time, achieves a lower final loss, and improves average accuracy by 0.66%.

*Amirpasha Hedayat,Alberto Padovan,Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes three adaptive non-intrusive ROM formulations (Adaptive OpInf, Adaptive NiTROM, and a hybrid) that online update both latent subspace and reduced dynamics to overcome limitations of static ROMs when systems evolve beyond training manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static ROMs become ineffective when systems leave training manifolds, limiting practical utility. There's need for adaptive, non-intrusive ROMs that can self-correct as dynamics evolve.

Method: Extends Operator Inference (OpInf) and NiTROM to online settings with three approaches: sequential basis/operator refits (Adaptive OpInf), joint Riemannian optimization of encoder/decoder/dynamics (Adaptive NiTROM), and a hybrid combining both. Analyzes computational cost scaling using data/adaptation windows on a perturbed lid-driven cavity flow.

Result: Static methods drift/destabilize beyond training. Adaptive OpInf robustly suppresses amplitude drift with modest cost. Adaptive NiTROM achieves near-exact energy tracking but is sensitive to initialization. Hybrid approach is most reliable under regime changes, yielding physically coherent fields with bounded energy.

Conclusion: ROM predictive claims must be cost-aware and transparent about training/adaptation/deployment regimes. This work provides a practical template for building self-correcting, non-intrusive ROMs that remain effective as dynamics evolve well beyond initial manifolds.

Abstract: Projection-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs) are often deployed as static surrogates, which limits their practical utility once a system leaves the training manifold. We formalize and study adaptive non-intrusive ROMs that update both the latent subspace and the reduced dynamics online. Building on ideas from static non-intrusive ROMs, specifically, Operator Inference (OpInf) and the recently-introduced Non-intrusive Trajectory-based optimization of Reduced-Order Models (NiTROM), we propose three formulations: Adaptive OpInf (sequential basis/operator refits), Adaptive NiTROM (joint Riemannian optimization of encoder/decoder and polynomial dynamics), and a hybrid that initializes NiTROM with an OpInf update. We describe the online data window, adaptation window, and computational budget, and analyze cost scaling. On a transiently perturbed lid-driven cavity flow, static Galerkin/OpInf/NiTROM drift or destabilize when forecasting beyond training. In contrast, Adaptive OpInf robustly suppresses amplitude drift with modest cost; Adaptive NiTROM is shown to attain near-exact energy tracking under frequent updates but is sensitive to its initialization and optimization depth; the hybrid is most reliable under regime changes and minimal offline data, yielding physically coherent fields and bounded energy. We argue that predictive claims for ROMs must be cost-aware and transparent, with clear separation of training/adaptation/deployment regimes and explicit reporting of online budgets and full-order model queries. This work provides a practical template for building self-correcting, non-intrusive ROMs that remain effective as the dynamics evolve well beyond the initial manifold.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes TDPNavigator-Placer, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for chiplet placement in 2.5D integrated circuits that optimizes the trade-off between wirelength and thermal management by assigning conflicting objectives to specialized agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid growth of 2.5D integrated circuits requires effective automated chiplet placement, but existing methods fail to handle inherently conflicting objectives like wirelength reduction and thermal management through simple weighted-sum approaches, limiting practical deployment.

Method: A multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where specialized agents handle distinct objectives (wirelength vs thermal) with separate reward mechanisms and environmental constraints, dynamically optimizing placement based on chiplet thermal design power (TDP).

Result: Achieves a significantly improved Pareto front compared to state-of-the-art methods, providing more balanced trade-offs between wirelength and thermal performance.

Conclusion: The specialized multi-agent approach effectively addresses the limitations of prior methods for competing design requirements, enabling practical deployment in heterogeneous chiplet assemblies.

Abstract: The rapid growth of electronics has accelerated the adoption of 2.5D integrated circuits, where effective automated chiplet placement is essential as systems scale to larger and more heterogeneous chiplet assemblies. Existing placement methods typically focus on minimizing wirelength or transforming multi-objective optimization into a single objective through weighted sum, which limits their ability to handle competing design requirements. Wirelength reduction and thermal management are inherently conflicting objectives, making prior approaches inadequate for practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose TDPNavigator-Placer, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes placement based on chiplet's thermal design power (TDP). This approach explicitly assigns these inherently conflicting objectives to specialized agents, each operating under distinct reward mechanisms and environmental constraints within a unified placement paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that TDPNavigator-Placer delivers a significantly improved Pareto front over state-of-the-art methods, enabling more balanced trade-offs between wirelength and thermal performance.

### [16] [MELINOE: Fine-Tuning Enables Memory-Efficient Inference for Mixture-of-Experts Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11192)
*Arian Raje,Anupam Nayak,Gauri Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MELINOE is a fine-tuning method for Mixture-of-Experts models that reduces inference latency by training models to activate fewer experts per sequence, caching preferred experts in GPU memory to minimize CPU-GPU transfer overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models have large parameter counts requiring full GPU memory loading, and prior offloading approaches suffer from high I/O latency when transferring experts between CPU and GPU, creating a memory bottleneck for resource-constrained settings.

Method: MELINOE fine-tunes MoE models to strongly prefer activating a smaller number of experts per sequence, then caches these preferred experts in GPU memory to reduce expert churn and CPU-GPU transfer overhead.

Result: The method achieves 1.2-3x throughput gains over efficient baselines and up to 14.7x over transfer-heavy baselines while maintaining or improving downstream task performance.

Conclusion: MELINOE provides a reliable approach for improving MoE inference efficiency by reducing expert transfer overhead without sacrificing model performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model architectures can significantly reduce the number of activated parameters per token, enabling computationally efficient training and inference. However, their large overall parameter counts and model sizes have precluded their widespread usage in resource-constrained settings as all of the parameters must still be loaded into GPU memory. Prior works aim to address this memory bottleneck by offloading certain experts into CPU memory and porting them to GPU memory only when they are activated. In practice, these methods suffer from the significant I/O latency incurred by expert transfer. We present MELINOE, a method that fine-tunes an MoE model to more strongly prefer activating a smaller number of experts per sequence. Caching these preferred experts in GPU memory reduces expert churn and CPU-GPU transfer overhead. MELINOE increases throughput by $1.2-3\times$ over efficient baselines and up to $14.7\times$ over transfer-heavy baselines while retaining or even improving the performance of the model on a downstream task, making it a reliable method for improving MoE inference efficiency.

TL;DR: 本研究应用机器学习算法预测和分类野火后泥石流，通过实验室降雨模拟实验分析疏水土壤在不同参数下的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野火后泥石流因土壤疏水性而破坏力极强，需理解降雨强度、坡度、入渗值和粒度对启动时机的影响。

Method: 采用多元线性回归、逻辑回归、支持向量分类器、K均值聚类和主成分分析等算法，对斜坡水槽实验数据进行预测和分类。

Result: 细砂在低强度长历时降雨下最易侵蚀；高强度降雨前10分钟对径流和破坏最关键；MLR预测径流好但侵蚀不准，LR和SVC分类准确度高。

Conclusion: 机器学习在野火后泥石流灾害评估和应急响应规划方面具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Post-wildfire mudflows are increasingly hazardous due to the prevalence of wildfires, including those on the wildland-urban interface. Upon burning, soil on the surface or immediately beneath becomes hydrophobic, a phenomenon that occurs predominantly on sand-based hillslopes. Rainwater and eroded soil blanket the downslope, leading to catastrophic debris flows. Soil hydrophobicity enhances erosion, resulting in post-wildfire debris flows that differ from natural mudflows in intensity, duration, and destructiveness. Thus, it is crucial to understand the timing and conditions of debris-flow onset, driven by the coupled effects of critical parameters: varying rain intensities (RI), slope gradients, water-entry values, and grain sizes (D50). Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become increasingly valuable in geotechnical engineering due to their ability to model complex systems without predefined assumptions. This study applies multiple ML algorithms: multiple linear regression (MLR), logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to predict and classify outcomes from laboratory experiments that model field conditions using a rain device on various soils in sloped flumes. While MLR effectively predicted total discharge, erosion predictions were less accurate, especially for coarse sand. LR and SVC achieved good accuracy in classifying failure outcomes, supported by clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fine sand is highly susceptible to erosion, particularly under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall. Results also show that the first 10 minutes of high-intensity rain are most critical for discharge and failure. These findings highlight the potential of ML for post-wildfire hazard assessment and emergency response planning.

Abstract: Ambient intelligence, continuously understanding human presence, activity, and physiology in physical spaces, is fundamental to smart environments, health monitoring, and human-computer interaction. WiFi infrastructure provides a ubiquitous, always-on, privacy-preserving substrate for this capability across billions of IoT devices. Yet this potential remains largely untapped, as wireless sensing has typically relied on task-specific models that require substantial labeled data and limit practical deployment.

Conclusion: ZePAD实现了零牺牲防御目标，通过增强特征多样性使单次对抗微调即可保护多个下游任务，同时保持良性性能不下降

Abstract: The widespread use of publicly available pre-trained encoders from self-supervised learning (SSL) has exposed a critical vulnerability: their susceptibility to downstream-agnostic adversarial examples (DAEs), which are crafted without knowledge of the downstream tasks but capable of misleading downstream models. While several defense methods have been explored recently, they rely primarily on task-specific adversarial fine-tuning, which inevitably limits generalizability and causes catastrophic forgetting and deteriorates benign performance. Different with previous works, we propose a more rigorous defense goal that requires only a single tuning for diverse downstream tasks to defend against DAEs and preserve benign performance. To achieve this defense goal, we introduce Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense (ZePAD), which is inspired by the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to data characteristics. Specifically, ZePAD is a dual-branch structure, which consists of a Multi-Pattern Adversarial Enhancement Branch (MPAE-Branch) that uses two adversarially fine-tuned encoders to strengthen adversarial resistance. The Benign Memory Preservation Branch (BMP-Branch) is trained on local data to ensure adversarial robustness does not compromise benign performance. Surprisingly, we find that ZePAD can directly detect DAEs by evaluating branch confidence, without introducing any adversarial exsample identification task during training. Notably, by enriching feature diversity, our method enables a single adversarial fine-tuning to defend against DAEs across downstream tasks, thereby achieving persistent robustness. Extensive experiments on 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets validate its effectiveness. In certain cases, it achieves a 29.20% improvement in benign performance and a 73.86% gain in adversarial robustness, highlighting its zero-sacrifice property.

*Yunchong Song,Jushi Kai,Liming Lu,Kaixi Qiu,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Elastic Memory, a HiPPO-based recurrent memory architecture that optimally compresses long contexts into fixed-size states through online function approximation, achieving 16x memory efficiency over Memorizing Transformer and outperforming Melodi across all memory sizes while enabling test-time inductive bias injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face quadratic attention complexity with long contexts. Existing recurrent memory methods struggle with a trade-off between theoretical principles and practical scalability, necessitating a more principled yet efficient solution.

Method: The method treats historical sequences as samples from continuous signals and applies HiPPO framework for optimal online compression into a fixed-size memory state. Retrieval uses a flexible polynomial sampling mechanism to reconstruct history summaries, with a decoupled design allowing test-time inductive bias injection.

Result: Elastic Memory outperforms baselines on 32k+ token datasets across three domains. With equal parameters, it achieves 16x memory efficiency vs Memorizing Transformer and beats Melodi at all memory sizes (even with 30% fewer parameters). At 4x model size, it remains superior and significantly faster than Melodi.

Conclusion: Elastic Memory successfully bridges theoretical soundness and practical scalability for long-context Transformers, providing an efficient, high-performance memory architecture that maintains advantages across varying model sizes and domains.

Abstract: Transformers face a quadratic bottleneck in attention when scaling to long contexts. Recent approaches introduce recurrent memory to extend context beyond the current window, yet these often face a fundamental trade-off between theoretical principles and practical scalability. To address this, we introduce Elastic Memory, a novel memory architecture grounded in the HiPPO framework for online function approximation. Elastic Memory treats historical sequence as samples from continuous signals, applying optimal online compression to encode them into a fixed-size memory state. For retrieval, we propose a flexible \textit{polynomial sampling} mechanism that reconstructs a history summary from this compressed state. Elastic Memory consistently outperformed baselines on long-context (32k+) datasets across three domains. With equal parameters, it beat Memorizing Transformer by 16x memory and outperformed Melodi at all memory sizes, even when Melodi had 30% more parameters. When scaling model size, Elastic Memory stayed ahead of all baselines and was significantly faster than Melodi at 4x size. Furthermore, its decoupled design allows for injecting inductive biases at test-time to boost performance.

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic study of multi-disciplinary LLM fine-tuning, analyzing four training methods across five scientific disciplines and discovering four empirical laws that provide practical guidance for improving cross-domain generalization with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs achieve strong performance in single-domain fine-tuning, their learning dynamics in multi-disciplinary contexts remain poorly understood despite the potential for improved generalization through cross-domain knowledge synergy.

Method: Constructed a five-discipline corpus and systematically analyzed learning patterns of full fine-tuning, LoRA, LoRA-MoE, and LoRA composition methods to identify consistent empirical laws.

Result: Found that multi-disciplinary learning is substantially more variable than single-discipline training, distilling four key laws: Balance-then-Diversity (upsampling prevents low-resource degradation), Merge-then-Align (instruction restoration enables synergy), Optimize-then-Scale (design optimization precedes parameter scaling), and Share-then-Specialize (asymmetric LoRA-MoE yields robust gains).

Conclusion: These four empirical laws form a practical recipe for principled multi-discipline fine-tuning and provide actionable guidance for developing more generalizable scientific LLMs.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance through fine-tuning within individual scientific domains, their learning dynamics in multi-disciplinary contexts remains poorly understood, despite the promise of improved generalization and broader applicability through cross-domain knowledge synergy. In this work, we present the first systematic study of multi-disciplinary LLM fine-tuning, constructing a five-discipline corpus and analyzing learning patterns of full fine-tuning, LoRA, LoRA-MoE, and LoRA compositions. Particularly, our study shows that multi-disciplinary learning is substantially more variable than single-discipline training and distills four consistent empirical laws: (1) Balance-then-Diversity: low-resource disciplines degrade performance unless mitigated via diversity-aware upsampling; (2) Merge-then-Align: restoring instruction-following ability is critical for cross-discipline synergy; (3) Optimize-then-Scale: parameter scaling offers limited gains without prior design optimization; and (4) Share-then-Specialize: asymmetric LoRA-MoE yields robust gains with minimal trainable parameters via shared low-rank projection. Together, these laws form a practical recipe for principled multi-discipline fine-tuning and provide actionable guidance for developing generalizable scientific LLMs.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a central computational tool in physics, chemistry, and biology, enabling quantitative prediction of experimental observables as expectations over high-dimensional molecular distributions such as Boltzmann distributions and transition densities. However, conventional MD is fundamentally limited by the high computational cost required to generate independent samples. Generative molecular dynamics (GenMD) has recently emerged as an alternative, learning surrogates of molecular distributions either from data or through interaction with energy models. While these methods enable efficient sampling, their transferability across molecular systems is often limited. In this work, we show that incorporating auxiliary sources of information can improve the data efficiency and generalization of transferable implicit transfer operators (TITO) for molecular dynamics. We find that coarse-grained TITO models are substantially more data-efficient than Boltzmann Emulators, and that incorporating protein language model (pLM) embeddings further improves out-of-distribution generalization. Our approach, PLaTITO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on equilibrium sampling benchmarks for out-of-distribution protein systems, including fast-folding proteins. We further study the impact of additional conditioning signals -- such as structural embeddings, temperature, and large-language-model-derived embeddings -- on model performance.

Abstract: Understanding how language model capabilities transfer from pretraining to supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is fundamental to efficient model development and data curation. In this work, we investigate four core questions: RQ1. To what extent do accuracy and confidence rankings established during pretraining persist after SFT? RQ2. Which benchmarks serve as robust cross-stage predictors and which are unreliable? RQ3. How do transfer dynamics shift with model scale? RQ4. How well does model confidence align with accuracy, as a measure of calibration quality? Does this alignment pattern transfer across training stages? We address these questions through a suite of correlation protocols applied to accuracy and confidence metrics across diverse data mixtures and model scales. Our experiments reveal that transfer reliability varies dramatically across capability categories, benchmarks, and scales -- with accuracy and confidence exhibiting distinct, sometimes opposing, scaling dynamics. These findings shed light on the complex interplay between pretraining decisions and downstream outcomes, providing actionable guidance for benchmark selection, data curation, and efficient model development.

Abstract: Decomposing predictive uncertainty into epistemic (model ignorance) and aleatoric (data ambiguity) components is central to reliable decision making, yet most methods estimate both from the same predictive distribution. Recent empirical and theoretical results show these estimates are typically strongly correlated, so changes in predictive spread simultaneously affect both components and blur their semantics. We propose a credal-set formulation in which uncertainty is represented as a set of predictive distributions, so that epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty correspond to distinct geometric properties: the size of the set versus the noise within its elements. We instantiate this idea in a Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with two disjoint uncertainty heads trained by disjoint objectives and non-overlapping gradient paths, yielding separation by construction rather than post hoc decomposition. Across multi-annotator benchmarks, our approach reduces the correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by over an order of magnitude compared to standard methods, while improving the alignment of epistemic uncertainty with prediction error and aleatoric uncertainty with ground-truth ambiguity.

*Ankita Paul,Wenyi Wang*

TL;DR: TopoGBM is a novel deep learning framework that uses topological regularization on 3D MRI to capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining robustness across different medical scanners, significantly improving glioblastoma prognosis accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional deep learning models fail to capture glioblastoma's extreme structural heterogeneity and suffer from poor generalizability across different MRI scanners due to inconsistent acquisition protocols, leading to scanner-specific artifacts and degraded cross-site prognosis performance.

Method: A 3D convolutional autoencoder architecture regularized by topological priors to preserve non-Euclidean tumor manifold invariants in a compressed latent space, explicitly modeling high-variance structural signatures of aggressive GBM from multi-parametric MRI.

Result: Achieved superior performance (C-index 0.67 test, 0.58 validation) across heterogeneous cohorts (UPENN, UCSF, RHUH, TCGA), with interpretability analysis showing reconstruction residuals localized to heterogeneous tumor zones and ~50% of prognostic signal from tumor and peritumoral microenvironment.

Conclusion: Incorporating topological priors enables learning of morphology-faithful embeddings that effectively capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness, demonstrating clinical reliability for unsupervised prognosis prediction.

Abstract: Accurate prognosis for Glioblastoma (GBM) using deep learning (DL) is hindered by extreme spatial and structural heterogeneity. Moreover, inconsistent MRI acquisition protocols across institutions hinder generalizability of models. Conventional transformer and DL pipelines often fail to capture the multi-scale morphological diversity such as fragmented necrotic cores, infiltrating margins, and disjoint enhancing components leading to scanner-specific artifacts and poor cross-site prognosis. We propose TopoGBM, a learning framework designed to capture heterogeneity-preserved, scanner-robust representations from multi-parametric 3D MRI. Central to our approach is a 3D convolutional autoencoder regularized by a topological regularization that preserves the complex, non-Euclidean invariants of the tumor's manifold within a compressed latent space. By enforcing these topological priors, TopoGBM explicitly models the high-variance structural signatures characteristic of aggressive GBM. Evaluated across heterogeneous cohorts (UPENN, UCSF, RHUH) and external validation on TCGA, TopoGBM achieves better performance (C-index 0.67 test, 0.58 validation), outperforming baselines that degrade under domain shift. Mechanistic interpretability analysis reveals that reconstruction residuals are highly localized to pathologically heterogeneous zones, with tumor-restricted and healthy tissue error significantly low (Test: 0.03, Validation: 0.09). Furthermore, occlusion-based attribution localizes approximately 50% of the prognostic signal to the tumor and the diverse peritumoral microenvironment advocating clinical reliability of the unsupervised learning method. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating topological priors enables the learning of morphology-faithful embeddings that capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness.

Abstract: Identifying type 2 diabetes mellitus can be challenging, particularly for primary care physicians. Clinical decision support systems incorporating artificial intelligence (AI-CDSS) can assist medical professionals in diagnosing type 2 diabetes with high accuracy. This study aimed to assess an AI-CDSS specifically developed for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by employing a hybrid approach that integrates expert-driven insights with machine learning techniques. The AI-CDSS was developed (training dataset: n = 650) and tested (test dataset: n = 648) using a dataset of 1298 patients with and without type 2 diabetes.

Furthermore, a clinical pilot study involving 105 patients was conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the system in comparison to non-endocrinology specialists. The AI-CDSS showed a high degree of accuracy, with 99.8% accuracy in predicting diabetes, 99.3% in predicting prediabetes, 99.2% in identifying at-risk individuals, and 98.8% in predicting no diabetes. The test dataset revealed a 98.8% agreement between endocrinology specialists and the AI-CDSS. Type 2 diabetes was identified in 45% of 105 individuals in the pilot study. Compared with diabetes specialists, the AI-CDSS scored a 98.5% concordance rate, greatly exceeding that of nonendocrinology specialists, who had an 85% agreement rate. These findings indicate that the AI-CDSS has the potential to be a useful tool for accurately identifying type 2 diabetes, especially in situations in which diabetes specialists are not readily available.

Motivation: 现有长期记忆基准测试主要关注简单的事实保留、多跳回忆和时间变化，这些能力可以通过简单的检索增强型LLM实现，无法有效测试复杂的记忆层次结构。随着记忆架构日益复杂，缺乏分析其能力并指导下一次设计的有效工具。

Method: 提出StructMemEval基准测试，收集一套需要按特定结构组织知识才能解决的任务套件，包括交易账簿、待办事项列表、树状结构等，测试智能体的记忆组织能力而非单纯回忆能力。

Result: 初步实验显示：1）简单的检索增强型LLM难以完成这些结构化记忆任务；2）当获得如何组织记忆的提示时，记忆智能体可以可靠解决；3）现代LLM在没有提示的情况下往往无法识别记忆结构。

Conclusion: 该基准测试揭示了当前LLM在自主识别和组织结构化记忆方面的不足，强调了在LLM训练和记忆框架设计上进行改进的重要性，为未来研究指明了关键方向。

Abstract: Modern LLM-based agents and chat assistants rely on long-term memory frameworks to store reusable knowledge, recall user preferences, and augment reasoning. As researchers create more complex memory architectures, it becomes increasingly difficult to analyze their capabilities and guide future memory designs. Most long-term memory benchmarks focus on simple fact retention, multi-hop recall, and time-based changes. While undoubtedly important, these capabilities can often be achieved with simple retrieval-augmented LLMs and do not test complex memory hierarchies. To bridge this gap, we propose StructMemEval - a benchmark that tests the agent's ability to organize its long-term memory, not just factual recall. We gather a suite of tasks that humans solve by organizing their knowledge in a specific structure: transaction ledgers, to-do lists, trees and others. Our initial experiments show that simple retrieval-augmented LLMs struggle with these tasks, whereas memory agents can reliably solve them if prompted how to organize their memory. However, we also find that modern LLMs do not always recognize the memory structure when not prompted to do so. This highlights an important direction for future improvements in both LLM training and memory frameworks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which asserts that intermediate layers of language models store features linearly. We separate the hypothesis into two claims: linear representation (features are linearly embedded in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). We then ask: How many neurons $d$ suffice to both linearly represent and linearly access $m$ features? Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.
  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = Ω_ε(\frac{k^2}{\log k}\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_ε(k^2\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the "superposition hypothesis" (Elhage et al., 2022).
  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Turán's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs). We also show how our results do and do not constrain the geometry of feature representations and extend our results to allow decoders with an activation function and bias.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出HiFloat4 (HiF4)，一种专为深度学习设计的块浮点数据格式。每个HiF4单元包含64个4位元素和32位共享缩放元数据，平均每个值占4.5位。该格式采用三级缩放层次结构，支持固定点式矩阵乘法，在降低硬件面积和功耗的同时，在多个大模型上比NVFP4格式获得更高的平均精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习推理需要高效的硬件实现以降低功耗和面积。块浮点格式能在减少精度的同时保持动态范围，但现有方案如NVFP4仍有改进空间。HiF4旨在通过优化缩放机制和分组策略，进一步提升计算效率和模型精度。

Method: 设计HiF4格式：64个4位元素共享32位缩放元数据，形成4.5位/值的有效精度；引入三级缩放层次结构捕获组间和组内动态范围；利用64元素的大分组实现高度固定点化的矩阵乘法。在LLaMA、Qwen、Mistral、DeepSeek-V3.1和LongCat等多个大模型上进行推理实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，HiF4在多个模型和下游任务上的平均精度均优于最先进的NVFP4格式。

Conclusion: HiF4通过创新的块浮点设计，在保持硬件效率优势的同时显著提升了模型精度，是深度学习推理中极具竞争力的新数据格式。

Abstract: This paper introduces HiFloat4 (HiF4), a block floating-point data format tailored for deep learning. Each HiF4 unit packs 64 4-bit elements with 32 bits of shared scaling metadata, averaging 4.5 bits per value. The metadata specifies a three-level scaling hierarchy, capturing inter- and intra-group dynamic range while improving the utilization of the representational space. In addition, the large 64-element group size enables matrix multiplications to be executed in a highly fixed-point manner, significantly reducing hardware area and power consumption. To evaluate the proposed format, we conducted inference experiments on several language models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek-V3.1 and LongCat. Results show that HiF4 achieves higher average accuracy than the state-of-the-art NVFP4 format across multiple models and diverse downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出蒸馏神经切核（DNTK），通过NTK调优的数据集蒸馏压缩数据维度，将NTK计算复杂度降低高达5个数量级，同时保持核结构和预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经切核（NTK）方法因需在大量数据点上评估大规模Jacobian矩阵而面临计算瓶颈。现有方法主要通过Jacobian投影和素描来降低成本，但未能有效压缩数据维度本身。

Method: 作者提出利用NTK调优的数据集蒸馏来压缩数据维度。研究发现，输入数据张成的神经切空间可通过蒸馏数据集诱导，且类特定NTK矩阵具有低有效秩特性。基于此，提出DNTK，将数据集蒸馏与先进投影方法结合。

Result: 该方法使Jacobian计算需求减少20-100倍，NTK整体计算复杂度降低多达5个数量级，同时完整保留了核结构和预测性能。

Conclusion: DNTK为传统NTK计算提供了高效替代方案，显著提升可扩展性，使其更适合大规模实际应用，同时不损失模型准确性。

Abstract: Neural tangent kernel (NTK) methods are computationally limited by the need to evaluate large Jacobians across many data points. Existing approaches reduce this cost primarily through projecting and sketching the Jacobian. We show that NTK computation can also be reduced by compressing the data dimension itself using NTK-tuned dataset distillation. We demonstrate that the neural tangent space spanned by the input data can be induced by dataset distillation, yielding a 20-100$\times$ reduction in required Jacobian calculations. We further show that per-class NTK matrices have low effective rank that is preserved by this reduction. Building on these insights, we propose the distilled neural tangent kernel (DNTK), which combines NTK-tuned dataset distillation with state-of-the-art projection methods to reduce up NTK computational complexity by up to five orders of magnitude while preserving kernel structure and predictive performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出预测联想记忆(PAM)架构，用时间共现性替代相似性作为记忆基础，通过双向JEPA预测器实现生物记忆的联想特性，在合成基准测试中显著优于传统相似性检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经记忆系统依赖基于相似性的检索，但生物记忆的核心特性是通过时间共现建立联想。当前方法无法捕捉这一基本属性，需要新的记忆架构。

Method: 提出预测联想记忆(PAM)架构：1) 采用JEPA风格的预测器学习连续经验流中的时间共现规律；2) 设计内向JEPA（预测可关联的过去状态）作为外向JEPA（预测未来状态）的互补机制；3) 通过时间共现训练在嵌入空间导航联想结构。

Result: 在合成基准测试中：1) 预测器首次检索准确率达97%（AP@1=0.970）；2) 跨边界召回率Recall@20=0.421（余弦相似度为零时）；3) 区分经验共现与非共现状态的AUC=0.916（余弦相似度仅0.789）；4) 即使嵌入相似度无信息量的跨房间配对，AUC仍达0.849；5) 时间打乱实验使跨边界召回下降90%，证明信号来自真实时间共现结构。

Conclusion: PAM架构通过时间共现性成功模拟生物记忆的联想特性，显著优于基于相似性的传统方法。实验证实时间结构而非嵌入几何是性能关键，为神经记忆系统提供了更符合生物机制的新范式。

Abstract: Current approaches to memory in neural systems rely on similarity-based retrieval: given a query, find the most representationally similar stored state. This assumption -- that useful memories are similar memories -- fails to capture a fundamental property of biological memory: association through temporal co-occurrence. We propose Predictive Associative Memory (PAM), an architecture in which a JEPA-style predictor, trained on temporal co-occurrence within a continuous experience stream, learns to navigate the associative structure of an embedding space. We introduce an Inward JEPA that operates over stored experience (predicting associatively reachable past states) as the complement to the standard Outward JEPA that operates over incoming sensory data (predicting future states). We evaluate PAM as an associative recall system -- testing faithfulness of recall for experienced associations -- rather than as a retrieval system evaluated on generalisation to unseen associations. On a synthetic benchmark, the predictor's top retrieval is a true temporal associate 97% of the time (Association Precision@1 = 0.970); it achieves cross-boundary Recall@20 = 0.421 where cosine similarity scores zero; and it separates experienced-together from never-experienced-together states with a discrimination AUC of 0.916 (cosine: 0.789). Even restricted to cross-room pairs where embedding similarity is uninformative, the predictor achieves AUC = 0.849 (cosine: 0.503, chance). A temporal shuffle control confirms the signal is genuine temporal co-occurrence structure, not embedding geometry: shuffling collapses cross-boundary recall by 90%, replicated across training seeds. All results are stable across seeds (SD < 0.006) and query selections (SD $\leq$ 0.012).

Conclusion: 混合模型通过融合机制先验与数据残差学习，为复杂动态系统(如医疗干预优化)提供鲁棒解决方案

Abstract: Estimating intervention effects in dynamical systems is crucial for outcome optimization. In medicine, such interventions arise in physiological regulation (e.g., cardiovascular system under fluid administration) and pharmacokinetics, among others. Propofol administration is an anesthetic intervention, where the challenge is to estimate the optimal dose required to achieve a target brain concentration for anesthesia, given patient characteristics, while avoiding under- or over-dosing. The pharmacokinetic state is characterized by drug concentrations across tissues, and its dynamics are governed by prior states, patient covariates, drug clearance, and drug administration. While data-driven models can capture complex dynamics, they often fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Mechanistic models on the other hand are typically robust, but might be oversimplified. We propose a hybrid mechanistic-data-driven approach to estimate time-dependent intervention outcomes. Our approach decomposes the dynamical system's transition operator into parametric and nonparametric components, further distinguishing between intervention-related and unrelated dynamics. This structure leverages mechanistic anchors while learning residual patterns from data. For scenarios where mechanistic parameters are unknown, we introduce a two-stage procedure: first, pre-training an encoder on simulated data, and subsequently learning corrections from observed data. Two regimes with incomplete mechanistic knowledge are considered: periodic pendulum and Propofol bolus injections. Results demonstrate that our hybrid approach outperforms purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches, particularly OOD. This work highlights the potential of hybrid mechanistic-data-driven models for robust intervention optimization in complex, real-world dynamical systems.

### [33] [Provably Efficient Algorithms for S- and Non-Rectangular Robust MDPs with General Parameterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11387)
*Anirudh Satheesh,Ziyi Chen,Furong Huang,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method for robust MDPs with general policies uses entropy regularization, multilevel Monte Carlo gradient estimation, and specialized optimization algorithms to achieve improved sample complexity guarantees, especially for average reward settings and non-rectangular uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) is limited to tabular policies, lacking sample complexity guarantees or incurring high computational costs. This paper aims to extend RMDP analysis to general policy parameterizations (e.g., neural networks) under both s-rectangular and non-rectangular uncertainty sets.

Method: The method reduces average reward RMDPs to entropy-regularized discounted robust MDPs, restoring strong duality for tractable equilibrium computation. It introduces a multilevel Monte Carlo gradient estimator for infinite-horizon gradient estimation, and designs two optimization algorithms: projected gradient descent for s-rectangular uncertainty and Frank-Wolfe for non-rectangular uncertainty.

Result: The paper proves novel Lipschitz and Lipschitz-smoothness properties for general policy parameterizations. The multilevel Monte Carlo estimator achieves O(ε⁻²) sample complexity (O(ε⁻²) improvement over prior work). Sample complexity bounds: O(ε⁻⁵) for PGD (s-rectangular), O(ε⁻⁴) discounted and O(ε⁻¹⁰·⁵) average reward for Frank-Wolfe (non-rectangular). This is the first work to provide sample complexity guarantees for RMDPs with general policy parameterization beyond (s,a)-rectangularity, and the first to do so in the average reward setting.

Conclusion: The work successfully extends robust MDP theory to general policy parameterizations with provable sample complexity guarantees across both rectangular and non-rectangular uncertainty sets, while significantly improving existing bounds for discounted settings and enabling analysis of average reward settings for the first time.

Abstract: We study robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) with general policy parameterization under s-rectangular and non-rectangular uncertainty sets. Prior work is largely limited to tabular policies, and hence either lacks sample complexity guarantees or incurs high computational cost. Our method reduces the average reward RMDPs to entropy-regularized discounted robust MDPs, restoring strong duality and enabling tractable equilibrium computation. We prove novel Lipschitz and Lipschitz-smoothness properties for general policy parameterizations that extends to infinite state spaces. To address infinite-horizon gradient estimation, we introduce a multilevel Monte Carlo gradient estimator with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(ε^{-2})$ sample complexity, a factor of $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2})$ improvement over prior work. Building on this, we design a projected gradient descent algorithm for s-rectangular uncertainty ($\mathcal{O}(ε^{-5})$) and a Frank--Wolfe algorithm for non-rectangular uncertainty ($\mathcal{O}(ε^{-4})$ discounted, $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-10.5})$ average reward), significantly improving prior results in both the discounted setting and average reward setting. Our work is the first one to provide sample complexity guarantees for RMDPs with general policy parameterization beyond $(s, a)$-rectangularity. It also provides the first such guarantees in the average reward setting and improves existing bounds for discounted robust MDPs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过提出有效容量由内部表征的稀疏性（通过稀疏语义维度SSD测量）而非参数量决定，来解释为何大语言模型在参数量远超训练token数时仍能良好泛化。研究表明更大模型需要更少的样本识别激活特征，并展示了检测分布外输入的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准统计学习理论预测大语言模型因其参数量远超训练token数而应过拟合，但实践中它们表现出强大的泛化能力。这一矛盾构成了需要解决的理论缺口。

Method: 作者提出稀疏语义维度（SSD），该度量来自在模型层上训练的稀疏自编码器（SAE）的激活特征词汇。他们将LLM和SAE视为冻结预言机，分析内部表征的几何结构，认为激活状态位于低维稀疏流形而非占据完整高维参数空间。

Result: 在GPT-2 Small和Gemma-2B上的实证验证表明，该框架在现实样本量下提供了非空泛的泛化保证。他们发现"特征锐度"缩放定律：尽管规模更大，Gemma-2B比GPT-2需要显著更少的校准样本来识别其激活流形，表明更大模型学习到更可压缩的语义结构。此外，该框架能通过"特征爆炸"（激活特征的急剧增加）检测分布外输入，作为认知不确定性的安全监控器。

Conclusion: 控制LLM泛化的有效容量由SSD衡量的内部表征稀疏性决定，而非总参数量。更大模型学习到更可压缩且独特的语义结构，该框架可通过特征违规可靠地监控模型安全性。

Abstract: Standard statistical learning theory predicts that Large Language Models (LLMs) should overfit because their parameter counts vastly exceed the number of training tokens. Yet, in practice, they generalize robustly. We propose that the effective capacity controlling generalization lies in the geometry of the model's internal representations: while the parameter space is high-dimensional, the activation states lie on a low-dimensional, sparse manifold. To formalize this, we introduce the Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD), a complexity measure derived from the active feature vocabulary of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on the model's layers. Treating the LLM and SAE as frozen oracles, we utilize this framework to attribute the model's generalization capabilities to the sparsity of the dictionary rather than the total parameter count. Empirically, we validate this framework on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2B, demonstrating that our bound provides non-vacuous certificates at realistic sample sizes. Crucially, we uncover a counter-intuitive "feature sharpness" scaling law: despite being an order of magnitude larger, Gemma-2B requires significantly fewer calibration samples to identify its active manifold compared to GPT-2, suggesting that larger models learn more compressible, distinct semantic structures. Finally, we show that this framework functions as a reliable safety monitor: out-of-distribution inputs trigger a measurable "feature explosion" (a sharp spike in active features), effectively signaling epistemic uncertainty through learned feature violation.

Motivation: 现有无条件扩散模型引导方法需重训练或每步梯度计算（如分类器引导），计算开销大

Method: 1) 噪声对齐：利用轻量离线引导信号在早期高噪声阶段实现粗粒度控制；2) 迁移性概念向量：通过递归特征机(RFM)学习激活空间的概念方向，该向量可跨时间步和样本迁移，在低噪声学习后仍适用于中间噪声水平；3) 避免推理期梯度计算

Result: 在CIFAR-10/ImageNet/CelebA上相比梯度引导提升精度/质量，同时显著加速推理

Conclusion: 无需梯度引导即可实现高效可控生成，提供轻量级、可扩展的扩散模型控制方案

Abstract: Guiding unconditional diffusion models typically requires either retraining with conditional inputs or per-step gradient computations (e.g., classifier-based guidance), both of which incur substantial computational overhead. We present a general recipe for efficiently steering unconditional diffusion {without gradient guidance during inference}, enabling fast controllable generation. Our approach is built on two observations about diffusion model structure: Noise Alignment: even in early, highly corrupted stages, coarse semantic steering is possible using a lightweight, offline-computed guidance signal, avoiding any per-step or per-sample gradients. Transferable concept vectors: a concept direction in activation space once learned transfers across both {timesteps} and {samples}; the same fixed steering vector learned near low noise level remains effective when injected at intermediate noise levels for every generation trajectory, providing refined conditional control with efficiency. Such concept directions can be efficiently and reliably identified via Recursive Feature Machine (RFM), a light-weight backpropagation-free feature learning method. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and CelebA demonstrate improved accuracy/quality over gradient-based guidance, while achieving significant inference speedups.

TL;DR: The paper demystifies forward-backward representation learning and proposes a simplified method called "one-step FB" that performs one step of policy improvement, achieving 10^5 times smaller errors and +24% improvement in zero-shot performance on RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is debate about the right form of prior for RL problems. Forward-backward representation learning claims to enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without fine-tuning, but its objective and learning behavior are not well understood.

Method: The authors analyze FB, connect it to rank matching, fitted Q-evaluation, and contraction mapping, and propose a simplified unsupervised pre-training method that performs one step of policy improvement.

Result: One-step FB converges to errors 10^5 times smaller and improves zero-shot performance by +24% on average across 10 continuous control domains.

Conclusion: A simplified unsupervised pre-training method for RL is suggested that performs one step of policy improvement, rather than enabling optimal control directly, leading to significantly better performance.

Abstract: As machine learning has moved towards leveraging large models as priors for downstream tasks, the community has debated the right form of prior for solving reinforcement learning (RL) problems. If one were to try to prefetch as much computation as possible, they would attempt to learn a prior over the policies for some yet-to-be-determined reward function. Recent work (forward-backward (FB) representation learning) has tried this, arguing that an unsupervised representation learning procedure can enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without further fine-tuning. However, FB's training objective and learning behavior remain mysterious. In this paper, we demystify FB by clarifying when such representations can exist, what its objective optimizes, and how it converges in practice. We draw connections with rank matching, fitted Q-evaluation, and contraction mapping. Our analysis suggests a simplified unsupervised pre-training method for RL that, instead of enabling optimal control, performs one step of policy improvement. We call our proposed method $\textbf{one-step forward-backward representation learning (one-step FB)}$. Experiments in didactic settings, as well as in $10$ state-based and image-based continuous control domains, demonstrate that one-step FB converges to errors $10^5$ smaller and improves zero-shot performance by $+24\%$ on average.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting transformer-based generative recommenders to ads CTR prediction faces challenges: handling post-scoring contextual signals (e.g., ad position), maintaining offline-online consistency, and scaling to industrial workloads.

Method: CADET uses a context-conditioned decoding architecture with multi-tower prediction heads, self-gated attention mechanism, timestamp-based RoPE for temporal modeling, session masking to prevent train-serve skew, and production optimizations (tensor packing, sequence chunking, custom Flash Attention kernels).

Result: In online A/B testing, CADET achieves an 11.04% CTR lift compared to the production LiRank baseline model (a hybrid ensemble of DCNv2 and sequential encoders).

Conclusion: CADET has been successfully deployed on LinkedIn's advertising platform, serving main traffic for homefeed sponsored updates, demonstrating the effectiveness of transformer architectures for industrial-scale ads CTR prediction.

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is fundamental to online advertising systems. While Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) with explicit feature interactions have long dominated this domain, recent advances in generative recommenders have shown promising results in content recommendation. However, adapting these transformer-based architectures to ads CTR prediction still presents unique challenges, including handling post-scoring contextual signals, maintaining offline-online consistency, and scaling to industrial workloads. We present CADET (Context-Conditioned Ads Decoder-Only Transformer), an end-to-end decoder-only transformer for ads CTR prediction deployed at LinkedIn. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a context-conditioned decoding architecture with multi-tower prediction heads that explicitly model post-scoring signals such as ad position, resolving the chicken-and-egg problem between predicted CTR and ranking; (2) a self-gated attention mechanism that stabilizes training by adaptively regulating information flow at both representation and interaction levels; (3) a timestamp-based variant of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) that captures temporal relationships across timescales from seconds to months; (4) session masking strategies that prevent the model from learning dependencies on unavailable in-session events, addressing train-serve skew; and (5) production engineering techniques including tensor packing, sequence chunking, and custom Flash Attention kernels that enable efficient training and serving at scale. In online A/B testing, CADET achieves a 11.04\% CTR lift compared to the production LiRank baseline model, a hybrid ensemble of DCNv2 and sequential encoders. The system has been successfully deployed on LinkedIn's advertising platform, serving the main traffic for homefeed sponsored updates.

Conclusion: TimeSynth为理解不同预测方法何时成功或失败提供了原则性基础，推动超越模型等效性的过度简化论断。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental tool with wide ranging applications, yet recent debates question whether complex nonlinear architectures truly outperform simple linear models. Prior claims of dominance of the linear model often stem from benchmarks that lack diverse temporal dynamics and employ biased evaluation protocols. We revisit this debate through TimeSynth, a structured framework that emulates key properties of real world time series,including non-stationarity, periodicity, trends, and phase modulation by creating synthesized signals whose parameters are derived from real-world time series. Evaluating four model families Linear, Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformers, we find a systematic bias in linear models: they collapse to simple oscillation regardless of signal complexity. Nonlinear models avoid this collapse and gain clear advantages as signal complexity increases. Notably, Transformers and CNN based models exhibit slightly greater adaptability to complex modulated signals compared to MLPs. Beyond clean forecasting, the framework highlights robustness differences under distribution and noise shifts and removes biases of prior benchmarks by using independent instances for train, test, and validation for each signal family. Collectively, TimeSynth provides a principled foundation for understanding when different forecasting approaches succeed or fail, moving beyond oversimplified claims of model equivalence.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多级升降级框架下的策略性分类问题，通过设计分类器阈值和难度递进，而非传统的权重优化方法，激励个体诚实努力，并证明在温和条件下个体可通过真实提升达到任意高水平。

Motivation: 现有序列策略性分类研究主要聚焦于动态分类器权重优化。本文突破这种"权重中心"范式，分析多级升降级体系中的分类器阈值设计与难度递进，以捕捉由远见、技能留存和自我强化效应驱动的跨期激励。

Method: 构建多级升降级框架模型，分析分类器阈值和难度递进设计，刻画个体最优长期策略，并设计阈值序列来激励诚实努力。

Result: 证明委托人可设计阈值序列有效激励诚实努力；在温和条件下，该机制使个体仅通过真实提升即可达到任意高水平。

Conclusion: 基于阈值和难度递进的机制能有效激励诚实行为，使个体通过真实努力达成高水平，为策略性分类提供了权重中心方法之外的替代方案。

Abstract: Strategic classification studies the problem where self-interested individuals or agents manipulate their response to obtain favorable decision outcomes made by classifiers, typically turning to dishonest actions when they are less costly than genuine efforts. While existing studies on sequential strategic classification primarily focus on optimizing dynamic classifier weights, we depart from these weight-centric approaches by analyzing the design of classifier thresholds and difficulty progression within a multi-level promotion-relegation framework. Our model captures the critical inter-temporal incentives driven by an agent's farsightedness, skill retention, and a leg-up effect where qualification and attainment can be self-reinforcing. We characterize the agent's optimal long-term strategy and demonstrate that a principal can design a sequence of thresholds to effectively incentivize honest effort. Crucially, we prove that under mild conditions, this mechanism enables agents to reach arbitrarily high levels solely through genuine improvement efforts.

TL;DR: 本文提出HCEP框架解决可解释图像分类中的概念层次结构问题，通过层次化概念嵌入和稀疏编码实现更可靠的概念恢复和分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释-by-design模型在图像分类中使用稀疏概念恢复，但忽略了概念间的层次结构，导致预测正确但解释与层次不一致的问题。

Method: 提出分层概念嵌入与追踪(HCEP)框架，在潜在空间中构建概念层次结构，并采用层次化稀疏编码从图像中恢复概念。假设正确概念在层次中形成根路径，推导了在嵌入空间中识别它们的理想条件。

Result: 在真实数据集上，HCEP在概念精度和召回率上优于基线，同时保持有竞争力的分类准确率；在样本有限时，HCEP能取得更好的分类准确率和概念恢复效果。

Conclusion: 将层次结构整合到稀疏编码中可产生更可靠和可解释的图像分类模型。

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are gaining traction in computer vision because they provide faithful explanations for their predictions. In image classification, these models typically recover human-interpretable concepts from an image and use them for classification. Sparse concept recovery methods leverage the latent space of vision-language models to represent image embeddings as a sparse combination of concept embeddings. However, because such methods ignore the hierarchical structure of concepts, they can produce correct predictions with explanations that are inconsistent with the hierarchy. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept Embedding \& Pursuit (HCEP), a framework that induces a hierarchy of concept embeddings in the latent space and uses hierarchical sparse coding to recover the concepts present in an image. Given a hierarchy of semantic concepts, we construct a corresponding hierarchy of concept embeddings and, assuming the correct concepts for an image form a rooted path in the hierarchy, derive desirable conditions for identifying them in the embedded space. We show that hierarchical sparse coding reliably recovers hierarchical concept embeddings, whereas vanilla sparse coding fails. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HCEP outperforms baselines in concept precision and recall while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Moreover, when the number of samples is limited, HCEP achieves superior classification accuracy and concept recovery. These results show that incorporating hierarchical structures into sparse coding yields more reliable and interpretable image classification models.

Abstract: Back pain is a pervasive issue affecting a significant portion of the population, often worsened by certain movements of the lower back. Assessing these movements is important for helping clinicians prescribe appropriate physical therapy. However, it can be difficult to monitor patients' movements remotely outside the clinic. High-fidelity data from motion capture sensors can be used to classify different movements, but these sensors are costly and impractical for use in free-living environments. Motion Tape (MT), a new fabric-based wearable sensor, addresses these issues by being low cost and portable. Despite these advantages, novelty and variability in sensor stability make the MT dataset small scale and inherent to noise. In this work, we propose the Motion-Tape Augmentation Inference Model (MT-AIM), a deep learning classification pipeline trained on MT data. In order to address the challenges of limited sample size and noise present within the MT dataset, MT-AIM leverages conditional generative models to generate synthetic MT data of a desired movement, as well as predicting joint kinematics as additional features. This combination of synthetic data generation and feature augmentation enables MT-AIM to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in classifying lower back movements, bridging the gap between physiological sensing and movement analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for recovering sparse vectors from linear models corrupted by Poisson noise. The contribution is twofold. First, an operator defined via the external division of two Bregman proximity operators is introduced to promote sparse solutions while mitigating the estimation bias induced by classical $\ell_1$-norm regularization. This operator is then embedded into the already established NoLips algorithm, replacing the standard Bregman proximity operator in a plug-and-play manner. Second, the geometric structure of the proposed external-division operator is elucidated through two complementary reformulations, which provide clear interpretations in terms of the primal and dual spaces of the Poisson inverse problem. Numerical tests show that the proposed method exhibits more stable convergence behavior than conventional Kullback-Leibler (KL)-based approaches and achieves significantly superior performance on synthetic data and an image restoration problem.

TL;DR: CMAB-GFN combines combinatorial multi-armed bandit with GFlowNets to prune low-quality actions and focus exploration on high-reward subspaces, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GFlowNets suffer from excessive exploration over vast state spaces, leading to over-sampling of low-reward regions and convergence to suboptimal distributions, making it challenging to effectively bias toward high-reward solutions.

Method: Proposes CMAB-GFN that integrates a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework with GFlowNet policies, where CMAB prunes low-quality actions to create compact high-scoring subspaces for exploration.

Result: Experimental results on multiple tasks demonstrate that CMAB-GFN generates higher-reward candidates than existing approaches.

Conclusion: CMAB-GFN successfully addresses GFlowNets' exploration inefficiency by restricting sampling to high-quality subspaces, accelerating discovery of high-value solutions while preserving diversity across subspaces.

Abstract: As a probabilistic sampling framework, Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) show strong potential for constructing complex combinatorial objects through the sequential composition of elementary components. However, existing GFlowNets often suffer from excessive exploration over vast state spaces, leading to over-sampling of low-reward regions and convergence to suboptimal distributions. Effectively biasing GFlowNets toward high-reward solutions remains a non-trivial challenge. In this paper, we propose CMAB-GFN, which integrates a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework with GFlowNet policies. The CMAB component prunes low-quality actions, yielding compact high-scoring subspaces for exploration. Restricting GFNs to these compact high-scoring subspaces accelerates the discovery of high-value candidates, while the exploration of different subspaces ensures that diversity is not sacrificed. Experimental results on multiple tasks demonstrate that CMAB-GFN generates higher-reward candidates than existing approaches.

*Xuan Yu,Xu Wang,Rui Zhu,Yudong Zhang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a planner-based exploration restriction method for GFlowNets to address convergence challenges in large state spaces, using partial state space partitioning and heuristic switching for faster convergence, higher rewards, and improved diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) show promise for generating high-reward candidates but face significant convergence challenges when scaling to large state spaces due to unrestricted free exploration.

Method: The method introduces a planner to partition the entire state space into overlapping partial state spaces, allowing efficient identification of high-reward subregions within limited spaces. A heuristic strategy switches between partial regions to avoid wasting time on fully explored or low-reward areas, enabling iterative exploration toward optimal subregions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model converges faster than existing methods on large state spaces, generates candidates with higher rewards, and significantly improves candidate diversity.

Conclusion: By restricting exploration through planner-based partitioning and heuristic switching, the method effectively addresses GFlowNets' scalability issues while enhancing both performance and diversity.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have shown promising potential to generate high-scoring candidates with probability proportional to their rewards. As existing GFlowNets freely explore in state space, they encounter significant convergence challenges when scaling to large state spaces. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes to restrict the exploration of actor. A planner is introduced to partition the entire state space into overlapping partial state spaces. Given their limited size, these partial state spaces allow the actor to efficiently identify subregions with higher rewards. A heuristic strategy is introduced to switch partial regions thus preventing the actor from wasting time exploring fully explored or low-reward partial regions. By iteratively exploring these partial state spaces, the actor learns to converge towards the high-reward subregions within the entire state space. Experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that \modelname converges faster than existing works on large state spaces. Furthermore, \modelname not only generates candidates with higher rewards but also significantly improves their diversity.

Abstract: Consensus clustering seeks to combine multiple clusterings of the same dataset, potentially derived by considering various non-sensitive attributes by different agents in a multi-agent environment, into a single partitioning that best reflects the overall structure of the underlying dataset. Recent work by Chakraborty et al, introduced a fair variant under proportionate fairness and obtained a constant-factor approximation by naively selecting the best closest fair input clustering; however, their offline approach requires storing all input clusterings, which is prohibitively expensive for most large-scale applications.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of fair consensus clustering in the streaming model, where input clusterings arrive sequentially and memory is limited. We design the first constant-factor algorithm that processes the stream while storing only a logarithmic number of inputs. En route, we introduce a new generic algorithmic framework that integrates closest fair clustering with cluster fitting, yielding improved approximation guarantees not only in the streaming setting but also when revisited offline. Furthermore, the framework is fairness-agnostic: it applies to any fairness definition for which an approximately close fair clustering can be computed efficiently. Finally, we extend our methods to the more general k-median consensus clustering problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业通常无法观察关键消费者行为：客户是否从竞争对手购买、选择不购买或甚至考虑企业报价。这种缺失的外部选择信息使得市场规模和偏好估计困难，尤其在没有不购买标签数据的情况下。现有方法依赖辅助市场份额、聚合或跨市场数据。

Conclusion: 校准方法能有效利用有偏差的辅助预测器，仅用购买数据获得统计有效的不购买估计，提升需求估计和决策质量。提供结合多个辅助预测器的稳健聚合扩展方案。

Abstract: Firms typically cannot observe key consumer actions: whether customers buy from a competitor, choose not to buy, or even fully consider the firm's offer. This missing outside-option information makes market-size and preference estimation difficult even in simple multinomial logit (MNL) models, and it is a central obstacle in practice when only transaction data are recorded. Existing approaches often rely on auxiliary market-share, aggregated, or cross-market data. We study a complementary setting in which a black-box auxiliary predictor provides outside-option probabilities, but is potentially biased or miscalibrated because it was trained in a different channel, period, or population, or produced by an external machine-learning system. We develop calibration methods that turn such imperfect predictions into statistically valid no-purchase estimates using purchase-only data from the focal environment. First, under affine miscalibration in logit space, we show that a simple regression identifies outside-option utility parameters and yields consistent recovery of no-purchase probabilities without collecting new labels for no-purchase events. Second, under a weaker nearly monotone condition, we propose a rank-based calibration method and derive finite-sample error bounds that cleanly separate auxiliary-predictor quality from first-stage utility-learning error over observed in-set choices. Our analysis also translates estimation error into downstream decision quality for assortment optimization, quantifying how calibration accuracy affects revenue performance. The bounds provide explicit dependence on predictor alignment and utility-learning error, clarifying when each source dominates. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements in no-purchase estimation and downstream assortment decisions, and we discuss robust aggregation extensions for combining multiple auxiliary predictors.

Conclusion: 这些发现为硬件-软件协同设计提供了可操作的指导方向，有助于使神经结构更好地适应设备智能的物理约束。

Abstract: The transition toward localized intelligence through Small Language Models (SLMs) has intensified the need for rigorous performance characterization on resource-constrained edge hardware. However, objectively measuring the theoretical performance ceilings of diverse architectures across heterogeneous platforms remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we propose a systematic framework based on the Roofline model that unifies architectural primitives and hardware constraints through the lens of operational intensity (OI). By defining an inference-potential region, we introduce the Relative Inference Potential as a novel metric to compare efficiency differences between Large Language Models (LLMs) on the same hardware substrate. Extensive empirical analysis across diverse compute tiers reveals that variations in performance and OI are significantly influenced by sequence length. We further identify a critical regression in OI as model depth increases. Additionally, our findings highlight an efficiency trap induced by hardware heterogeneity and demonstrate how structural refinements, such as Multi-head Latent Attention (M LA), can effectively unlock latent inference potential across various hardware substrates. These insights provide actionable directions for hardware-software co-design to align neural structures with physical constraints in on-device intelligence. The released code is available in the Appendix C.

Conclusion: 该统一方法简单而原则性强，为RLHF提供了更优的解决方案，有效平衡了奖励破解防护与优化稳定性之间的权衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has advanced alignment capabilities significantly but remains hindered by two core challenges: \textbf{reward hacking} and \textbf{stable optimization}. Current solutions independently address these issues through separate regularization strategies, specifically a KL-divergence penalty against a supervised fine-tuned model ($π_0$) to mitigate reward hacking, and policy ratio clipping towards the current policy ($π_t$) to promote stable alignment. However, the implicit trade-off arising from simultaneously regularizing towards both $π_0$ and $π_t$ remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce a unified regularization approach that explicitly balances the objectives of preventing reward hacking and maintaining stable policy updates. Our simple yet principled alignment objective yields a weighted supervised fine-tuning loss with a superior trade-off, which demonstrably improves both alignment results and implementation complexity. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate that our method consistently outperforms RLHF and online preference learning methods, achieving enhanced alignment performance and stability.

Motivation: 移动GUI智能体的强化学习面临长时程任务中的时间信用分配难题。现有方法在奖励保真度与密度之间存在根本性冲突：结果奖励保真度高但信号稀疏，过程奖励密集但易产生偏差和奖励劫持问题。这种奖励设计困境限制了智能体在复杂GUI任务中的学习效率和性能上限。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for training Mobile GUI Agents, yet it struggles with the temporal credit assignment problem inherent in long-horizon tasks. A primary challenge lies in the trade-off between reward fidelity and density: outcome reward offers high fidelity but suffers from signal sparsity, while process reward provides dense supervision but remains prone to bias and reward hacking. To resolve this conflict, we propose the Adaptive Milestone Reward (ADMIRE) mechanism. ADMIRE constructs a verifiable, adaptive reward system by anchoring trajectory to milestones, which are dynamically distilled from successful explorations. Crucially, ADMIRE integrates an asymmetric credit assignment strategy that denoises successful trajectories and scaffolds failed trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADMIRE consistently yields over 10% absolute improvement in success rate across different base models on AndroidWorld. Moreover, the method exhibits robust generalizability, achieving strong performance across diverse RL algorithms and heterogeneous environments such as web navigation and embodied tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PASCAL is a phase-aware scheduling algorithm for reasoning-based LLMs that reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 72% through reasoning-phase prioritization, controlled preemption, and dynamic migration at phase boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-based LLMs using Chain-of-Thought inference suffer from extended reasoning phases that delay user output and inflate TTFT. Existing LLM serving frameworks treat reasoning and answering phases identically, causing performance degradation under GPU memory constraints.

Method: PASCAL implements a hierarchical scheduler combining instance-level placement with intra-instance execution. It prioritizes reasoning computation to reduce TTFT, uses controlled preemption and token pacing during answering to preserve QoE, and enables dynamic migration at phase boundaries to balance load and reduce interference.

Result: Across benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, PASCAL reduces tail TTFT by up to 72% while maintaining answering phase service-level objective (SLO) attainment.

Conclusion: Phase-aware scheduling is essential for efficient deployment of reasoning-based LLMs, as demonstrated by PASCAL's significant TTFT improvements without compromising answer quality.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning-based LLMs leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) inference introduces new serving challenges, as their extended reasoning phases delay user-visible output and inflate Time-To-First-Token (TTFT). Existing LLM serving frameworks fail to distinguish between reasoning and answering phases, leading to performance degradation under GPU memory constraints. We present PASCAL, a phase-aware scheduling algorithm that prioritizes reasoning to reduce TTFT while using controlled preemption and token pacing during answering to preserve Quality-of-Experience (QoE). Our hierarchical scheduler combines instance-level placement with intra-instance execution and enables dynamic migration at phase boundaries to balance load and reduce interference. Across benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, PASCAL reduces tail TTFT by up to 72% while maintaining answering phase SLO attainment, demonstrating the importance of phase-aware scheduling for reasoning-based LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 针对多变量时间序列预测中自回归与跨维度交互的优化冲突问题，本文提出ALTTS双路径框架，通过解耦两种效应并采用交替优化策略，显著提升了长时序预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模型在多变量时间序列预测中同时建模稳定的自回归动态和间歇性的跨维度交互时会产生优化冲突：跨维度建模所需的高方差更新会破坏支持自回归的梯度，导致训练不稳定和长时序预测精度下降。

Method: 提出ALTTS双路径框架：AR路径采用线性预测器，CR路径使用配备跨关系自注意力机制(CRSA)的Transformer；通过交替优化协调两个分支，隔离梯度噪声并减少跨块干扰。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ALTTS持续优于先前方法，在长时序预测任务上的改进最为显著。

Conclusion: 精心设计优化策略（而非仅仅追求更复杂的架构）是多变量时间序列预测领域取得进展的关键驱动力。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting involves two qualitatively distinct factors: (i) stable within-series autoregressive (AR) dynamics, and (ii) intermittent cross-dimension interactions that can become spurious over long horizons. We argue that fitting a single model to capture both effects creates an optimization conflict: the high-variance updates needed for cross-dimension modeling can corrupt the gradients that support autoregression, resulting in brittle training and degraded long-horizon accuracy. To address this, we propose ALTTS, a dual-path framework that explicitly decouples autoregression and cross-relation (CR) modeling. In ALTTS, the AR path is instantiated with a linear predictor, while the CR path uses a Transformer equipped with Cross-Relation Self-Attention (CRSA); the two branches are coordinated via alternating optimization to isolate gradient noise and reduce cross-block interference. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ALTTS consistently outperforms prior methods, with the most pronounced improvements on long-horizon forecasting. Overall, our results suggest that carefully designed optimization strategies, rather than ever more complex architectures, can be a key driver of progress in multivariate time series forecasting.

TL;DR: Proposes Krause Attention, replacing global softmax with localized bounded-confidence interactions to prevent representation collapse/attention sinks in Transformers, achieving linear complexity and consistent performance gains across vision/generation/LLM tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global softmax in self-attention causes token competition, synchronization dynamics leading to representation collapse and attention sinks; existing methods lack principled solutions to moderate attention concentration.

Method: Replaces similarity-based global aggregation with distance-based localized sparse interactions inspired by bounded-confidence consensus dynamics, restricting token influence to neighborhoods for structured synchronization.

Result: Reduces runtime complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length; demonstrates consistent performance improvements on ViT (CIFAR/ImageNet), autoregressive generation (MNIST/CIFAR-10), and LLMs (Llama/Qwen) with substantially reduced computation.

Conclusion: Bounded-confidence dynamics provide a scalable inductive bias that alleviates attention concentration issues while maintaining effectiveness across diverse Transformer architectures and tasks.

Abstract: Self-attention in Transformers relies on globally normalized softmax weights, causing all tokens to compete for influence at every layer. When composed across depth, this interaction pattern induces strong synchronization dynamics that favor convergence toward a dominant mode, a behavior associated with representation collapse and attention sink phenomena. We introduce Krause Attention, a principled attention mechanism inspired by bounded-confidence consensus dynamics. Krause Attention replaces similarity-based global aggregation with distance-based, localized, and selectively sparse interactions, promoting structured local synchronization instead of global mixing. We relate this behavior to recent theory modeling Transformer dynamics as interacting particle systems, and show how bounded-confidence interactions naturally moderate attention concentration and alleviate attention sinks. Restricting interactions to local neighborhoods also reduces runtime complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. Experiments across vision (ViT on CIFAR/ImageNet), autoregressive generation (MNIST/CIFAR-10), and large language models (Llama/Qwen) demonstrate consistent gains with substantially reduced computation, highlighting bounded-confidence dynamics as a scalable and effective inductive bias for attention.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for training large reasoning models--combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)--is fundamentally constrained by its reliance on high-quality, human-annotated reasoning data and external verifiers. This dependency incurs significant data-collection costs, risks embedding human cognitive biases, and confines the reinforcement learning stage to objectively assessable domains like mathematics and coding, leaving a wide range of unverifiable tasks beyond its scope. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NRT (Native Reasoning Training), a novel framework that cultivates complex reasoning by having the model generate its own reasoning traces using only standard question-answer pairs, thereby obviating the need for expert-written demonstrations. NRT reframes the training problem by treating the reasoning process as a latent variable. It employs a unified training objective that models reasoning as an optimization problem, intrinsically rewarding paths that increase the model's likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. This unified perspective allows us to analyze intrinsic failure modes of prior methods, such as policy collapse, and systematically design more robust reward aggregation functions, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop where the model learns to think in ways that resolve its own uncertainty. Empirical evaluation on Llama and Mistral model families demonstrates that NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance among verifier-free methods, significantly outperforming standard SFT baselines and prior verifier-free RL methods. Our approach yields particularly strong performance gains in complex reasoning domains and exhibits high robustness to policy collapse, offering a general, scalable path toward building more powerful and broadly applicable reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TS-Memory is a lightweight memory adapter that uses parametric memory distillation to enhance frozen Time Series Foundation Models, achieving retrieval-like forecasting improvements without the computational latency of traditional retrieval methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time Series Foundation Models struggle with domain adaptation under distribution shift, and existing solutions face a trade-off between parametric adaptation (catastrophic forgetting, high maintenance) and non-parametric retrieval (high inference latency).

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Build an offline, leakage-safe kNN teacher that synthesizes confidence-aware quantile targets from retrieved futures; 2) Distill this retrieval-induced correction into a lightweight memory adapter using confidence-gated supervision, enabling constant-time inference fusion.

Result: Consistent improvements in both point and probabilistic forecasting across diverse TSFMs and benchmarks, outperforming representative adaptation methods while maintaining efficiency comparable to frozen backbones.

Conclusion: TS-Memory successfully bridges the gap between parametric and non-parametric approaches, enabling retrieval-free deployment that combines the stability of frozen models with the accuracy benefits of retrieval-based adaptation.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) achieve strong zero-shot forecasting through large-scale pre-training, but adapting them to downstream domains under distribution shift remains challenging. Existing solutions face a trade-off: Parametric Adaptation can cause catastrophic forgetting and requires costly multi-domain maintenance, while Non-Parametric Retrieval improves forecasts but incurs high inference latency due to datastore search. We propose Parametric Memory Distillation and implement it as TS-Memory, a lightweight memory adapter that augments frozen TSFMs. TS-Memory is trained in two stages. First, we construct an offline, leakage-safe kNN teacher that synthesizes confidence-aware quantile targets from retrieved futures. Second, we distill this retrieval-induced distributional correction into a lightweight memory adapter via confidence-gated supervision. During inference, TS-Memory fuses memory and backbone predictions with constant-time overhead, enabling retrieval-free deployment. Experiments across diverse TSFMs and benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both point and probabilistic forecasting over representative adaptation methods, with efficiency comparable to the frozen backbone.

*Jichu Li,Xuan Tang,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析多类分类中mini-batch随机最速下降的隐式偏置，揭示批量大小、动量和方差缩减如何塑造极限最大间隔行为及收敛率，并提供维度无关的显式收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解随机优化方法的隐式偏置对于解释机器学习模型的泛化能力至关重要。许多广泛使用的优化方法如SignSGD和Muon可解释为不同范数几何下的最速下降，因此系统研究这些方法在不同条件下的行为模式具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Method: 该研究从理论角度分析多类分类问题中mini-batch随机最速下降的隐式偏置，在一般的逐元范数和Schatten-p范数下刻画其极限最大间隔行为与收敛速率，并给出完全显式的维度无关收敛速率。

Result: 主要发现：(1)无动量时仅在大批量下收敛，存在批量依赖的间隔间隙但保持全批量收敛率；(2)动量通过批量-动量权衡实现小批量收敛，但减慢收敛速度；(3)方差缩减可在任意批量下恢复精确的全批量隐式偏置，但收敛更慢；(4)单样本无动量最速下降会收敛到完全不同的偏置。

Conclusion: 该统一分析阐明随机优化何时与全批量行为一致，为深入探索随机梯度最速下降算法的训练行为提供理论基础，并得到优于先前结果的维度无关收敛速率。

Abstract: A variety of widely used optimization methods like SignSGD and Muon can be interpreted as instances of steepest descent under different norm-induced geometries. In this work, we study the implicit bias of mini-batch stochastic steepest descent in multi-class classification, characterizing how batch size, momentum, and variance reduction shape the limiting max-margin behavior and convergence rates under general entry-wise and Schatten-$p$ norms. We show that without momentum, convergence only occurs with large batches, yielding a batch-dependent margin gap but the full-batch convergence rate. In contrast, momentum enables small-batch convergence through a batch-momentum trade-off, though it slows convergence. This approach provides fully explicit, dimension-free rates that improve upon prior results. Moreover, we prove that variance reduction can recover the exact full-batch implicit bias for any batch size, albeit at a slower convergence rate. Finally, we further investigate the batch-size-one steepest descent without momentum, and reveal its convergence to a fundamentally different bias via a concrete data example, which reveals a key limitation of purely stochastic updates. Overall, our unified analysis clarifies when stochastic optimization aligns with full-batch behavior, and paves the way for perform deeper explorations of the training behavior of stochastic gradient steepest descent algorithms.

Abstract: Brain Foundation Models (BFMs) are transforming neuroscience by enabling scalable and transferable learning from neural signals, advancing both clinical diagnostics and cutting-edge neuroscience exploration. Their emergence is powered by large-scale clinical recordings, particularly electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG, which provide rich temporal and spatial representations of brain dynamics. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the field lacks a unified understanding of existing methodologies and a standardized evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we map the benchmark design space along two axes: (i) from the model perspective, we organize BFMs under a self-supervised learning (SSL) taxonomy; and (ii) from the dataset perspective, we summarize common downstream tasks and curate representative public datasets across clinical and human-centric neurotechnology applications. Building on this consolidation, we introduce Brain4FMs, an open evaluation platform with plug-and-play interfaces that integrates 15 representative BFMs and 18 public datasets. It enables standardized comparisons and analysis of how pretraining data, SSL strategies, and architectures affect generalization and downstream performance, guiding more accurate and transferable BFMs. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Brain4FMs-85B8.

TL;DR: 该论文针对联邦学习中梯度压缩导致损失 landscape 变尖锐从而损害泛化能力的问题，提出 FedSynSAM 方法，通过全局模型轨迹生成合成数据以准确估计全局扰动，解决数据异构性下的 SAM 应用难题，理论证明收敛性并通过实验验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度压缩在联邦学习中虽提升通信效率，但会引发损失 landscape 尖锐化（尤其非 IID 数据下），损害模型泛化能力；而现有 SAM 方法在联邦学习中因数据异构性导致全局扰动估计不准，且当模型更新被压缩时该问题更严重。

Method: 提出 FedSynSAM：利用全局模型轨迹构建合成数据，实现全局扰动的准确估计，从而在梯度压缩场景下有效应用 SAM 优化。

Result: 理论证明了算法的收敛性，并通过大量实验验证了 FedSynSAM 在梯度压缩联邦学习中的有效性，缓解了尖锐化问题并提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: FedSynSAM 通过合成数据机制解决了数据异构和压缩导致的扰动估计难题，为梯度压缩联邦学习提供了兼顾通信效率与泛化性能的优化方案。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that gradient compression in federated learning (FL) enjoys significant improvement in communication efficiency with negligible performance degradation. In this paper, we find that gradient compression induces sharper loss landscapes in federated learning, particularly under non-IID data distributions, which suggests hindered generalization capability. The recently emerging Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) effectively searches for a flat minima by incorporating a gradient ascent step (i.e., perturbing the model with gradients) before the celebrated stochastic gradient descent. Nonetheless, the direct application of SAM in FL suffers from inaccurate estimation of the global perturbation due to data heterogeneity. Existing approaches propose to utilize the model update from the previous communication round as a rough estimate. However, its effectiveness is hindered when model update compression is incorporated. In this paper, we propose FedSynSAM, which leverages the global model trajectory to construct synthetic data and facilitates an accurate estimation of the global perturbation. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is established, and extensive experiments are conducted to validate its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SkillRater框架，将数据质量评估从单一分数扩展为多维度能力评分，通过元学习训练多个专业评分器，并采用渐进式选择规则提升视觉语言模型训练效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据整理方法使用单一质量分数存在根本局限：当训练需要多种不同能力时，单一评分器无法同时为所有能力最大化有效信号，质量应被理解为多维概念

Method: 开发SkillRater框架：1) 为每种能力维度训练专门的评分器（通过元学习在独立验证目标上训练）2) 采用渐进式选择规则：在训练各阶段保留任一评分器排名高于阈值的样本（阈值随时间收紧）

Result: 在20亿参数视觉语言模型上验证：相比未过滤基线，在视觉理解任务提升5.63%，OCR任务提升2.00%，STEM推理任务提升3.53%；学习到的评分器信号近乎正交，确认为独立质量维度

Conclusion: 多维质量分解方法优于单一评分过滤和未过滤训练，通过捕获真正独立的质素维度，解释了其在多能力模型训练中的优越性

Abstract: Data curation methods typically assign samples a single quality score. We argue this scalar framing is fundamentally limited: when training requires multiple distinct capabilities, a monolithic scorer cannot maximize useful signals for all of them simultaneously. Quality is better understood as multidimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a capability the model must acquire. We introduce SkillRater, a framework that decomposes data filtering into specialized raters - one per capability, each trained via meta-learning on a disjoint validation objective - and composes their scores through a progressive selection rule: at each training stage, a sample is retained if any rater ranks it above a threshold that tightens over time, preserving diversity early while concentrating on high-value samples late. We validate this approach on vision language models, decomposing quality into three capability dimensions: visual understanding, OCR, and STEM reasoning. At 2B parameters, SkillRater improves over unfiltered baselines by 5.63% on visual understanding, 2.00% on OCR, and 3.53% on STEM on held out benchmarks. The learned rater signals are near orthogonal, confirming that the decomposition captures genuinely independent quality dimensions and explaining why it outperforms both unfiltered training and monolithic learned filtering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究系统验证了化学语言模型中增加训练资源对性能的影响，发现预训练损失持续下降但下游任务性能提升有限，揭示了预训练评估与实际应用之间的鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战"增加训练资源总能提升化学语言模型性能"的传统认知，这一假设在化学领域尚未得到系统验证。

Method: 系统扩展训练资源（模型规模、数据集大小、训练算力）预训练CLMs，在多样分子性质预测任务上测量迁移性能，并用Hessian和损失景观等指标评估模型。

Result: 预训练损失随资源增加持续下降，但下游性能提升有限；Hessian等替代指标无法估计下游性能；识别了性能饱和或下降的条件及任务相关失败模式。

Conclusion: 暴露了预训练评估与下游性能间的重大脱节，强调需开发显式考虑下游任务特性的模型选择和评估策略。

Abstract: Chemical Language Models (CLMs) pre-trained on large scale molecular data are widely used for molecular property prediction. However, the common belief that increasing training resources such as model size, dataset size, and training compute improves both pretraining loss and downstream task performance has not been systematically validated in the chemical domain. In this work, we evaluate this assumption by pretraining CLMs while scaling training resources and measuring transfer performance across diverse molecular property prediction (MPP) tasks. We find that while pretraining loss consistently decreases with increased training resources, downstream task performance shows limited improvement. Moreover, alternative metrics based on the Hessian or loss landscape also fail to estimate downstream performance in CLMs. We further identify conditions under which downstream performance saturates or degrades despite continued improvements in pretraining metrics, and analyze the underlying task dependent failure modes through parameter space visualizations. These results expose a gap between pretraining based evaluation and downstream performance, and emphasize the need for model selection and evaluation strategies that explicitly account for downstream task characteristics.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视概率值（如Shapley值和Banzhaf值）在决策树局部解释中的特征排序应用。研究发现概率值在联合优化插入/删除指标时不可靠，因此提出TreeGrad直接优化联合目标函数。TreeGrad在O(L)时间内计算梯度，包含加权Banzhaf值。基于此，作者开发了TreeGrad-Ranker进行特征排序，TreeGrad-Shap用于稳定计算Beta Shapley值，以及TreeProb推广Linear TreeShap支持所有概率值。实验显示TreeGrad-Shap数值误差比Linear TreeShap小10^15倍，TreeGrad-Ranker在插入/删除指标上显著更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视概率值（Shapley和Banzhaf值）用于决策树局部预测值解释的特征排序，发现概率值在解决联合优化问题（选择特征子集使其最大化预测值同时最小化补集预测值）时普遍不可靠。

Method: 提出TreeGrad，在O(L)时间内计算决策树联合目标函数多线性扩展的梯度；基于此开发TreeGrad-Ranker聚合梯度进行特征排序，TreeGrad-Shap稳定计算Beta Shapley值，以及TreeProb推广Linear TreeShap支持所有概率值。

Result: TreeGrad-Ranker的特征评分满足概率值所有公理（除线性性外）；TreeGrad-Shap的数值误差比Linear TreeShap小达10^15倍；TreeGrad-Ranker在插入/删除指标上表现显著更好。

Conclusion: 直接优化联合目标函数比使用概率值更可靠，TreeGrad系列算法为决策树特征排序提供了更精确和稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: We revisit the use of probabilistic values, which include the well-known Shapley and Banzhaf values, to rank features for explaining the local predicted values of decision trees. The quality of feature rankings is typically assessed with the insertion and deletion metrics. Empirically, we observe that co-optimizing these two metrics is closely related to a joint optimization that selects a subset of features to maximize the local predicted value while minimizing it for the complement. However, we theoretically show that probabilistic values are generally unreliable for solving this joint optimization. Therefore, we explore deriving feature rankings by directly optimizing the joint objective. As the backbone, we propose TreeGrad, which computes the gradients of the multilinear extension of the joint objective in $O(L)$ time for decision trees with $L$ leaves; these gradients include weighted Banzhaf values. Building upon TreeGrad, we introduce TreeGrad-Ranker, which aggregates the gradients while optimizing the joint objective to produce feature rankings, and TreeGrad-Shap, a numerically stable algorithm for computing Beta Shapley values with integral parameters. In particular, the feature scores computed by TreeGrad-Ranker satisfy all the axioms uniquely characterizing probabilistic values, except for linearity, which itself leads to the established unreliability. Empirically, we demonstrate that the numerical error of Linear TreeShap can be up to $10^{15}$ times larger than that of TreeGrad-Shap when computing the Shapley value. As a by-product, we also develop TreeProb, which generalizes Linear TreeShap to support all probabilistic values. In our experiments, TreeGrad-Ranker performs significantly better on both insertion and deletion metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/watml/TreeGrad.

TL;DR: 该论文探索跨域图提示学习(GPL)为何有效的问题，提出GP2F双分支框架，融合预训练知识保留和任务自适应，通过对比学习和拓扑一致性约束进行自适应融合，在跨域少样本任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域GPL更接近实际应用，但其有效性原因尚不明确；实证发现GPL方法与全微调(FT)和线性探测(LP)等简单基线相当，这促使作者从理论层面理解提示机制，探究如何整合预训练知识和任务特定适应的优势。

Method: 提出GP2F双分支GPL方法：(1)冻结分支保持预训练知识不变；(2)适配分支使用轻量级适配器进行任务特定适应；通过对比损失和拓扑一致性损失在拓扑约束下进行自适应特征融合。

Result: 理论分析证明融合两个互补分支比单独使用任一分支具有更小的估计误差；跨域少样本节点分类和图分类的广泛实验表明GP2F优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 跨域GPL的核心优势在于有效整合预训练知识与任务自适应；GP2F通过显式实例化冻结与适配双分支，并施加拓扑约束，实现了这一整合，为跨域图迁移学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation of pre-trained graph models, mitigating the misalignment between pre-training objectives and downstream tasks. Recently, the focus of GPL has shifted from in-domain to cross-domain scenarios, which is closer to the real world applications, where the pre-training source and downstream target often differ substantially in data distribution. However, why GPLs remain effective under such domain shifts is still unexplored. Empirically, we observe that representative GPL methods are competitive with two simple baselines in cross-domain settings: full fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP), motivating us to explore a deeper understanding of the prompting mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that jointly leveraging these two complementary branches yields a smaller estimation error than using either branch alone, formally proving that cross-domain GPL benefits from the integration between pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method that explicitly instantiates the two extremes: (1) a frozen branch that retains pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation. We then perform adaptive fusion under topology constraints via a contrastive loss and a topology-consistent loss. Extensive experiments on cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: 一种名为TIP的新防御方法通过在联邦学习中选择性对重要CNN通道的高频分量添加噪声，有效防止梯度反演攻击，同时比现有方法更好地保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习易受梯度反演攻击，攻击者可通过共享梯度重建私有训练数据。现有差分隐私等防御方法对所有参数添加统一噪声，严重损害模型效用和收敛稳定性。

Method: TIP采用双重目标策略：（1）利用Grad-CAM识别编码语义特征的关键卷积通道；（2）通过离散傅里叶变换将选定核转换到频域，选择性地向高频谱注入校准扰动，破坏图像重建所需的细粒度细节，同时保留低频信息以维持模型精度。

Result: 实验表明，TIP能使重建图像在视觉上无法识别，同时保持与无隐私保护基线相当的模型精度，在隐私-效用权衡和可解释性方面显著优于基于差分隐私的现有防御方法。

Conclusion: TIP通过选择性扰动重要参数的高频分量，为联邦学习中的梯度反演攻击提供了有效且可解释的防御，实现了比现有方法更好的隐私-效用平衡。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training while preserving data locality; however, the exchange of gradients renders the system vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs), allowing adversaries to reconstruct private training data with high fidelity. Existing defenses, such as Differential Privacy (DP), typically employ indiscriminate noise injection across all parameters, which severely degrades model utility and convergence stability. To address those limitation, we proposes Targeted Interpretable Perturbation (TIP), a novel defense framework that integrates model interpretability with frequency domain analysis. Unlike conventional methods that treat parameters uniformly, TIP introduces a dual-targeting strategy. First, leveraging Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to quantify channel sensitivity, we dynamically identify critical convolution channels that encode primary semantic features. Second, we transform these selected kernels into the frequency domain via the Discrete Fourier Transform and selectively inject calibrated perturbations into the high-frequency spectrum. By selectively perturbing high-frequency components, TIP effectively destroys the fine-grained details necessary for image reconstruction while preserving the low-frequency information crucial for model accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TIP renders reconstructed images visually unrecognizable against state-of-the-art GIAs, while maintaining global model accuracy comparable to non-private baselines, significantly outperforming existing DP-based defenses in the privacy-utility trade-off and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LG-Plug is an LLM-guided plug-and-play strategy that improves OOD detection on text-attributed graphs by aligning topology/text embeddings and generating reliable pseudo-OOD exposures via clustered LLM prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs on text-attributed graphs fail to detect OOD nodes due to limitations in existing methods: topology-driven approaches underutilize text semantics, while LLM-based methods produce unreliable pseudo-OOD priors and ignore validated topology-level insights.

Method: Aligns graph topology and text representations for fine-grained embeddings; generates consensus-driven OOD exposure through clustered iterative LLM prompting; uses lightweight in-cluster codebooks and heuristic sampling to reduce LLM query costs.

Result: Produces reliable OOD exposure as a regularization term that effectively separates ID/OOD nodes, enabling seamless integration with existing detectors to improve OOD detection performance.

Conclusion: LG-Plug provides an effective, efficient, and plug-and-play solution for TAG OOD detection by harmonizing semantic and structural information while mitigating limitations of prior LLM/topology-based approaches.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) associate nodes with textual attributes and graph structure, enabling GNNs to jointly model semantic and structural information. While effective on in-distribution (ID) data, GNNs often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes with unseen textual or structural patterns in real-world settings, leading to overconfident and erroneous predictions in the absence of reliable OOD detection. Early approaches address this issue from a topology-driven perspective, leveraging neighboring structures to mitigate node-level detection bias. However, these methods typically encode node texts as shallow vector features, failing to fully exploit rich semantic information. In contrast, recent LLM-based approaches generate pseudo OOD priors by leveraging textual knowledge, but they suffer from several limitations: (1) a reliability-informativeness imbalance in the synthesized OOD priors, as the generated OOD exposures either deviate from the true OOD semantics, or introduce non-negligible ID noise, all of which offers limited improvement to detection performance; (2) reliance on specialized architectures, which prevents incorporation of the extensive effective topology-level insights that have been empirically validated in prior work. To this end, we propose LG-Plug, an LLM-Guided Plug-and-play strategy for TAG OOD detection tasks. LG-Plug aligns topology and text representations to produce fine-grained node embeddings, then generates consensus-driven OOD exposure via clustered iterative LLM prompting. Moreover, it leverages lightweight in-cluster codebook and heuristic sampling reduce time cost of LLM querying. The resulting OOD exposure serves as a regularization term to separate ID and OOD nodes, enabling seamless integration with existing detectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管UMAP是最广泛使用的非线性降维和数据可视化算法之一，且通过代数拓扑框架呈现，但其与经典谱方法的确切关系一直停留在非正式层面，缺乏严格的理论证明。

Method: 证明分为三步：(1) 证明UMAP的随机优化与负采样构成相似图上的对比学习目标；(2) 引用HaoChen等人的结果，建立相似图上对比学习与谱聚类的等价性；(3) 验证UMAP的谱初始化计算了该谱问题的精确线性解。

Result: UMAP在模糊k近邻图上精确执行谱聚类；对于高斯核该等价性精确成立，对于UMAP默认的Cauchy核则作为一阶近似成立。

Conclusion: 该结果将UMAP、对比学习和谱聚类统一在一个框架下，为UMAP的多种经验观察提供了理论基础，使其行为得到理论解释。

Abstract: UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is among the most widely used algorithms for non linear dimensionality reduction and data visualisation. Despite its popularity, and despite being presented through the lens of algebraic topology, the exact relationship between UMAP and classical spectral methods has remained informal. In this work, we prove that UMAP performs spectral clustering on the fuzzy k nearest neighbour graph. Our proof proceeds in three steps: (1) we show that UMAP's stochastic optimisation with negative sampling is a contrastive learning objective on the similarity graph; (2) we invoke the result of HaoChen et al. [8], establishing that contrastive learning on a similarity graph is equivalent to spectral clustering; and (3) we verify that UMAP's spectral initialisation computes the exact linear solution to this spectral problem. The equivalence is exact for Gaussian kernels, and holds as a first order approximation for UMAP's default Cauchy type kernel. Our result unifies UMAP, contrastive learning, and spectral clustering under a single framework, and provides theoretical grounding for several empirical observations about UMAP's behaviour.

Conclusion: 首次实现全一阶在线双层优化，在降低计算复杂度的同时提供理论保证，为动态嵌套优化问题提供新解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we study non-convex-strongly-convex online bilevel optimization (OBO). Existing OBO algorithms are mainly based on hypergradient descent, which requires access to a Hessian-vector product (HVP) oracle and potentially incurs high computational costs. By reformulating the original OBO problem as a single-level online problem with inequality constraints and constructing a sequence of Lagrangian function, we eliminate the need for HVPs arising from implicit differentiation. Specifically, we propose a fully first-order algorithm for OBO, and provide theoretical guarantees showing that it achieves regret of $O(1 + V_T + H_{2,T})$. Furthermore, we develop an improved variant with an adaptive inner-iteration scheme, which removes the dependence on the drift variation of the inner-level optimal solution and achieves regret of $O(\sqrt{T} + V_T)$. This regret have the advatange when $V_{T}\ge O(\sqrt{T})$.

TL;DR: This study uses optical motion capture and machine learning to detect knee injury gait patterns (PFPS and ITBS) in runners, with CNNs achieving up to 77.9% accuracy on hybrid time-series and point features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Running has high knee injury rates (PFPS and ITBS), and identifying associated gait patterns could improve clinical decision-making by enabling precise analysis of temporal kinematic data.

Method: Analyzed 839 treadmill recordings using optical motion capture. Extracted joint/segment angle time series and discrete point values during stance phase. Tested three classification tasks (healthy vs injured, PFPS, ITBS) across classical (KNN, Decision Trees) and deep learning (CNNs, LSTMs) models using hybrid, time-series, and point-based feature spaces. Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, plus explainability tools (Shapley values, Grad-CAM).

Result: Hybrid features (time series + point values) substantially improved detection. Deep learning outperformed classical models, with CNNs achieving highest accuracy: 77.9% (PFPS), 73.8% (ITBS), and 71.43% (combined injury class).

Conclusion: Motion capture systems combined with advanced machine learning show strong potential for identifying knee injury-related running patterns, offering a promising tool for clinical assessment and injury prevention.

Abstract: Running is a widely practiced activity but shows a high incidence of knee injuries, especially Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) and Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS). Identifying gait patterns linked to these injuries can improve clinical decision-making, which requires precise systems capable of capturing and analyzing temporal kinematic data.
  This study uses optical motion capture systems to enhance detection of injury-related running patterns. We analyze a public dataset of 839 treadmill recordings from healthy and injured runners to evaluate how effectively these systems capture dynamic parameters relevant to injury classification. The focus is on the stance phase, using joint and segment angle time series and discrete point values.
  Three classification tasks are addressed: healthy vs. injured, healthy vs. PFPS, and healthy vs. ITBS. We examine different feature spaces, from traditional point-based metrics to full stance-phase time series and hybrid representations. Multiple models are tested, including classical algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Processes, Decision Trees) and deep learning architectures (CNNs, LSTMs).
  Performance is evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Explainability tools such as Shapley values, saliency maps, and Grad-CAM are used to interpret model behavior. Results show that combining time series with point values substantially improves detection. Deep learning models outperform classical ones, with CNNs achieving the highest accuracy: 77.9% for PFPS, 73.8% for ITBS, and 71.43% for the combined injury class.
  These findings highlight the potential of motion capture systems coupled with advanced machine learning to identify knee injury-related running patterns.

*Oliver Zahn,Matt Beton,Simran Chana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes ANML, a framework that weights training samples by four quality factors (gradient consistency, verification status, contributor reputation, temporal relevance) to improve model performance and enable attribution, achieving 33-72% error reduction and robustness against strategic attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI training pipelines treat all samples identically regardless of quality, giving equal weight to expert contributions and unverified submissions, leading to suboptimal performance and vulnerability to data corruption.

Method: ANML framework combining gradient-based signals (what model observes) with provenance metadata (verification status, contributor reputation, temporal relevance) to compute per-contributor quality weights, plus a Two-Stage Adaptive gating mechanism for safety guarantees.

Result: Across 5 datasets (178-32,561 samples): 33-72% error reduction over gradient-only baselines; 20% high-quality data outperforms 100% uniform data by 47%; never underperforms best baseline even under strategic attacks; contributor-level attribution provides 1.3-5.3x greater improvement than sample-level methods when corruption is subtle.

Conclusion: Quality-weighted training with attribution-native design significantly improves model performance, data efficiency, and robustness while enabling effective downstream attribution, making it superior to uniform training approaches.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems increasingly train on specialized expert data, from clinical records to proprietary research to curated datasets, yet current training pipelines treat all samples identically. A Nobel laureate's contribution receives the same weight as an unverified submission. We introduce ANML (Attribution-Native Machine Learning), a framework that weights training samples by four quality factors: gradient-based consistency (q), verification status (v), contributor reputation (r), and temporal relevance (T). By combining what the model observes (gradient signals) with what the system knows about data provenance (external signals), ANML produces per-contributor quality weights that simultaneously improve model performance and enable downstream attribution. Across 5 datasets (178-32,561 samples), ANML achieves 33-72% error reduction over gradient-only baselines. Quality-weighted training is data-efficient: 20% high-quality data outperforms 100% uniformly weighted data by 47%. A Two-Stage Adaptive gating mechanism guarantees that ANML never underperforms the best available baseline, including under strategic joint attacks combining credential faking with gradient alignment. When per-sample detection fails against subtle corruption, contributor-level attribution provides 1.3-5.3x greater improvement than sample-level methods, with the advantage growing as corruption becomes harder to detect.

TL;DR: SpiralFormer通过多分辨率递归机制改进循环Transformer，在迭代过程中以不同尺度处理压缩的潜在表示，显著提升了参数和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有循环Transformer虽解耦了计算深度与参数深度，但在同等计算量下仍落后于非循环基线，且都采用固定的全token分辨率，忽略了压缩潜在表示的计算效率优势。

Method: 提出SpiralFormer架构，在循环执行过程中采用多分辨率递归调度，使模型能够在不同迭代阶段处理不同尺度的压缩表示。

Result: 在160M到1.4B参数规模的模型上，SpiralFormer相比循环和非循环基线均实现了更优的参数和计算效率。

Conclusion: 多分辨率递归通过诱导尺度间的迭代功能特化使模型学习层次化依赖关系，确立了序列分辨率作为扩展循环架构的新维度。

Abstract: Recursive (looped) Transformers decouple computational depth from parameter depth by repeatedly applying shared layers, providing an explicit architectural primitive for iterative refinement and latent reasoning. However, early looped Transformers often underperform non-recursive baselines of equal compute. While recent literature has introduced more effective recursion mechanisms to mitigate this gap, existing architectures still operate at a fixed, full-token resolution, neglecting the potential efficiency of computing over compressed latent representations. In this paper, we propose SpiralFormer, a looped Transformer that executes recurrence under a multi-resolution recursion schedule. We provide probing evidence that multi-resolution recursion enables the model to learn hierarchical dependencies by inducing iteration-wise functional specialization across different scales. Empirically, SpiralFormer achieves better parameter and compute efficiency than both looped and non-looped baselines across model scales from 160M to 1.4B, establishing sequence resolution as a potential axis for scaling recursive architectures.

TL;DR: 提出TabSieve框架解决表格预测中有效利用行内证据的问题，通过显式选择和条件预测提升性能，在分类和回归任务上分别取得2.92%和4.45%的平均提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格模型无法一致地利用相关行作为少样本证据，存在推理脆弱、噪声上下文影响性能的问题，缺乏明确可审计的证据使用机制

Method: 设计select-then-predict框架TabSieve，先选择信息行作为证据再条件预测；构建TabSieve-SFT-40K高质量数据集；提出TAB-GRPO强化学习方法联合优化选择与预测，采用动态任务优势平衡稳定训练

Result: 在75个分类和52个回归表格的基准测试上，TabSieve在各少样本预算下稳定提升性能，分类平均提升2.92%，回归平均提升4.45%，且对噪声上下文更鲁棒

Conclusion: 显式证据选择机制能显著提升表格预测模型性能，使模型更专注于选定证据并增强鲁棒性，为表格学习提供了新范式

Abstract: Tabular prediction can benefit from in-table rows as few-shot evidence, yet existing tabular models typically perform instance-wise inference and LLM-based prompting is often brittle. Models do not consistently leverage relevant rows, and noisy context can degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose TabSieve, a select-then-predict framework that makes evidence usage explicit and auditable. Given a table and a query row, TabSieve first selects a small set of informative rows as evidence and then predicts the missing target conditioned on the selected evidence. To enable this capability, we construct TabSieve-SFT-40K by synthesizing high-quality reasoning trajectories from 331 real tables using a strong teacher model with strict filtering. Furthermore, we introduce TAB-GRPO, a reinforcement learning recipe that jointly optimizes evidence selection and prediction correctness with separate rewards, and stabilizes mixed regression and classification training via dynamic task-advantage balancing. Experiments on a held-out benchmark of 75 classification and 52 regression tables show that TabSieve consistently improves performance across shot budgets, with average gains of 2.92% on classification and 4.45% on regression over the second-best baseline. Further analysis indicates that TabSieve concentrates more attention on the selected evidence, which improves robustness to noisy context.

Result: 1.7B/4B/8B参数的DICE模型在KernelBench上全面超越同规模自回归和扩散模型，达到CUDA内核生成新SOTA

Conclusion: 通过数据增强和双阶段训练策略有效解决领域数据稀缺问题，验证了扩散模型在结构化代码生成任务中的优越性

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, owing to their capacity for parallel token generation. This paradigm is particularly well-suited for code generation, where holistic structural planning and non-sequential refinement are critical. Despite this potential, tailoring dLLMs for CUDA kernel generation remains challenging, obstructed not only by the high specialization but also by the severe lack of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we construct CuKe, an augmented supervised fine-tuning dataset optimized for high-performance CUDA kernels. On top of it, we propose a bi-phase curated reinforcement learning (BiC-RL) framework consisting of a CUDA kernel infilling stage and an end-to-end CUDA kernel generation stage. Leveraging this training framework, we introduce DICE, a series of diffusion large language models designed for CUDA kernel generation, spanning three parameter scales, 1.7B, 4B, and 8B. Extensive experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that DICE significantly outperforms both autoregressive and diffusion LLMs of comparable scale, establishing a new state-of-the-art for CUDA kernel generation.

TL;DR: 提出一种激活空间的参数高效微调方法，通过冻结权重并学习神经元级阈值和增益，实现类似神经调节的"模式切换"，在保持参数效率的同时提升可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法(如低秩适应LoRA)通过添加权重增量来适应模型，但难以进行机理解释，且无法直接揭示哪些内部计算被重用或绕过。

Method: 提出一种冻结基模型权重，学习每个神经元的阈值和增益的方法。训练时使用平滑门控机制决定神经元激活是否参与，推理时可硬化门控以实现显式条件计算和神经元级归因。

Result: 在MNIST和旋转45° MNIST模式专业化任务上，该方法仅用每层几百个可训练参数就提升了旋转任务准确率，表现出部分激活稀疏性。相比LoRA，用部分准确率换取更少的参数和"哪些神经元激活"的更高可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可解释的模式切换视角，但存在局限性：当冻结基模型缺乏目标任务所需特征时，表达能力受限。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as \lora{} adapt large pretrained models by adding small weight-space updates. While effective, weight deltas are hard to interpret mechanistically, and they do not directly expose \emph{which} internal computations are reused versus bypassed for a new task. We explore an alternative view inspired by neuromodulation: adaptation as a change in \emph{mode} -- selecting and rescaling existing computations -- rather than rewriting the underlying weights. We propose \methodname{}, a simple activation-space PEFT technique that freezes base weights and learns per-neuron \emph{thresholds} and \emph{gains}. During training, a smooth gate decides whether a neuron's activation participates; at inference the gate can be hardened to yield explicit conditional computation and neuron-level attributions.
  As a proof of concept, we study ``mode specialization'' on MNIST (0$^\circ$) versus rotated MNIST (45$^\circ$). We pretrain a small MLP on a 50/50 mixture (foundation), freeze its weights, and then specialize to the rotated mode using \methodname{}. Across seeds, \methodname{} improves rotated accuracy over the frozen baseline while using only a few hundred trainable parameters per layer, and exhibits partial activation sparsity (a minority of units strongly active). Compared to \lora{}, \methodname{} trades some accuracy for substantially fewer trainable parameters and a more interpretable ``which-neurons-fire'' mechanism. We discuss limitations, including reduced expressivity when the frozen base lacks features needed for the target mode.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗与金融等领域对不规则采样时间序列的概率预测需求迫切，但现有方法仍面临挑战。神经控制微分方程虽能有效建模连续动态，但其固有的顺序计算特性导致速度缓慢，限制了在可扩展性和全局上下文获取方面的能力。

Method: UFO 架构创新性地整合了 U-Net 的并行多尺度特征提取、Transformer 的全局建模优势以及神经控制微分方程的连续时间动态建模能力。该完全因果且可并行化的模型兼具全局感受野与对局部时间动态的强敏感性。

Result: 在涵盖规则与不规则采样的五个基准测试上的大量实验表明，UFO 在预测精度上持续优于十种当前最优的神经基线方法。同时，其推理速度较传统神经控制微分方程提升最高达 15 倍，对长序列及高维多元序列保持稳定表现。

Conclusion: UFO 成功克服神经控制微分方程的计算瓶颈，在保持高精度的同时实现高效推理，为大规模时间序列预测应用提供了理想解决方案。

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series is crucial in domains such as healthcare and finance, yet it remains a formidable challenge. Existing Neural Controlled Differential Equation (Neural CDE) approaches, while effective at modelling continuous dynamics, suffer from slow, inherently sequential computation, which restricts scalability and limits access to global context. We introduce UFO (U-Former ODE), a novel architecture that seamlessly integrates the parallelizable, multiscale feature extraction of U-Nets, the powerful global modelling of Transformers, and the continuous-time dynamics of Neural CDEs. By constructing a fully causal, parallelizable model, UFO achieves a global receptive field while retaining strong sensitivity to local temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks -- covering both regularly and irregularly sampled time series -- demonstrate that UFO consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art neural baselines in predictive accuracy. Moreover, UFO delivers up to 15$\times$ faster inference compared to conventional Neural CDEs, with consistently strong performance on long and highly multivariate sequences.

Motivation: 在二分类系统中，决策阈值将模型分数转化为行动。模型重训练会改变分数分布，使现有阈值失效。在多租户评分即服务环境中，决策边界位于客户管理的设施中，重新校准需要协调数百个客户更新阈值，消耗大量人力并导致模型停滞。

Method: MUSE通过解耦模型分数与客户端决策边界实现无缝模型更新，采用动态意图路由优化基础设施复用，并结合两级分数变换将模型输出映射到稳定的参考分布。

Result: 在Feedzai规模化部署，MUSE每秒处理超过1000个事件，12个月内处理超过550亿事件，覆盖数十个租户，同时保持高可用性和低延迟。它将模型交付周期从数周缩短至分钟级别。

Conclusion: MUSE通过实现无需客户协调的模型更新，提升了模型对变化攻击的抵御能力，为欺诈损失和运营成本节省了数百万美元。

Abstract: In binary classification systems, decision thresholds translate model scores into actions. Choosing suitable thresholds relies on the specific distribution of the underlying model scores but also on the specific business decisions of each client using that model. However, retraining models inevitably shifts score distributions, invalidating existing thresholds. In multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments, where decision boundaries reside in client-managed infrastructure, this creates a severe bottleneck: recalibration requires coordinating threshold updates across hundreds of clients, consuming excessive human hours and leading to model stagnation. We introduce MUSE, a model serving framework that enables seamless model updates by decoupling model scores from client decision boundaries. Designed for multi-tenancy, MUSE optimizes infrastructure re-use by sharing models via dynamic intent-based routing, combined with a two-level score transformation that maps model outputs to a stable, reference distribution. Deployed at scale by Feedzai, MUSE processes over a thousand events per second, and over 55 billion events in the last 12 months, across several dozens of tenants, while maintaining high-availability and low-latency guarantees. By reducing model lead time from weeks to minutes, MUSE promotes model resilience against shifting attacks, saving millions of dollars in fraud losses and operational costs.

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试上，TAMPO均优于使用固定或启发式温度的基线方法

Conclusion: 温度可作为有效的可学习元策略，实现LLM强化学习中的自适应探索

Abstract: Temperature is a crucial hyperparameter in large language models (LLMs), controlling the trade-off between exploration and exploitation during text generation. High temperatures encourage diverse but noisy outputs, while low temperatures produce focused outputs but may cause premature convergence. Yet static or heuristic temperature schedules fail to adapt to the dynamic demands of reinforcement learning (RL) throughout training, often limiting policy improvement. We propose Temperature Adaptive Meta Policy Optimization (TAMPO), a new framework that recasts temperature control as a learnable meta-policy. TAMPO operates through a hierarchical two-loop process. In the inner loop, the LLM policy is updated (e.g., using GRPO) with trajectories sampled at the temperature selected by the meta-policy. In the outer loop, meta-policy updates the distribution over candidate temperatures by rewarding those that maximize the likelihood of high-advantage trajectories. This trajectory-guided, reward-driven mechanism enables online adaptation without additional rollouts, directly aligning exploration with policy improvement. On five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, TAMPO outperforms baselines using fixed or heuristic temperatures, establishing temperature as an effective learnable meta-policy for adaptive exploration in LLM reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPECTRE, a minimax-fair classification method that ensures fairness without demographic information by adjusting Fourier feature spectrum and constraining distributional deviation. It achieves superior and more consistent fairness guarantees than existing methods, even outperforming some that use group information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness methods require demographic group information rarely available in practice. Current robust optimization approaches without such information are overly pessimistic about outliers, harming both fairness and overall performance.

Method: SPECTRE is a minimax-fair method that (1) adjusts the spectrum of Fourier feature mapping and (2) constrains the worst-case distribution's deviation from empirical distribution. It provides theoretical guarantees with computable error bounds.

Result: On American Community Survey data across 20 states, SPECTRE delivers highest average fairness guarantees with smallest interquartile range, outperforming state-of-the-art methods including those with demographic information access.

Conclusion: SPECTRE safely achieves superior fairness guarantees without demographic information by balancing robustness and performance, with strong theoretical foundations.

Abstract: As automated classification systems become increasingly prevalent, concerns have emerged over their potential to reinforce and amplify existing societal biases. In the light of this issue, many methods have been proposed to enhance the fairness guarantees of classifiers. Most of the existing interventions assume access to group information for all instances, a requirement rarely met in practice. Fairness without access to demographic information has often been approached through robust optimization techniques,which target worst-case outcomes over a set of plausible distributions known as the uncertainty set. However, their effectiveness is strongly influenced by the chosen uncertainty set. In fact, existing approaches often overemphasize outliers or overly pessimistic scenarios, compromising both overall performance and fairness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a minimax-fair method that adjusts the spectrum of a simple Fourier feature mapping and constrains the extent to which the worst-case distribution can deviate from the empirical distribution. We perform extensive experiments on the American Community Survey datasets involving 20 states. The safeness of SPECTRE comes as it provides the highest average values on fairness guarantees together with the smallest interquartile range in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches, even compared to those with access to demographic group information. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis that derives computable bounds on the worst-case error for both individual groups and the overall population, as well as characterizes the worst-case distributions responsible for these extremal performances

Motivation: 传统大模型安全评测侧重任务广度，但实际部署中重复相同提示导致的运行故障风险更关键，现有评测无法反映模型在持续使用下的响应一致性与安全性

Method: 受可靠性工程启发，APST在受控条件（如解码温度）下重复采样相同提示，用伯努利/二项模型量化单次推理故障概率，评估幻觉、拒绝不一致等故障模式

Result: 在AIR-BENCH安全提示测试中，相似基准得分的模型在重复采样下故障率差异显著，且随温度升高更明显，证明单次评测会掩盖可靠性差异

Conclusion: APST补充了现有评测体系，为高敏感场景提供部署导向的可靠性评估框架， bridging 基准对齐与真实风险

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess safety risk through breadth-oriented evaluation across diverse tasks. However, real-world deployment exposes a different class of risk: operational failures arising from repeated inference on identical or near-identical prompts rather than broad task generalization. In high-stakes settings, response consistency and safety under sustained use are critical. We introduce Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST), a depth-oriented evaluation framework inspired by reliability engineering. APST repeatedly samples identical prompts under controlled operational conditions (e.g., decoding temperature) to surface latent failure modes including hallucinations, refusal inconsistency, and unsafe completions. Rather than treating failures as isolated events, APST models them as stochastic outcomes of independent inference events. We formalize safety failures using Bernoulli and binomial models to estimate per-inference failure probabilities, enabling quantitative comparison of reliability across models and decoding configurations. Applying APST to multiple instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on AIR-BENCH-derived safety prompts, we find that models with similar benchmark-aligned scores can exhibit substantially different empirical failure rates under repeated sampling, particularly as temperature increases. These results demonstrate that shallow, single-sample evaluation can obscure meaningful reliability differences under sustained use. APST complements existing benchmarks by providing a practical framework for evaluating LLM safety and reliability under repeated inference, bridging benchmark alignment and deployment-oriented risk assessment.

TL;DR: Proposes CIR framework using Tanh constraints on initial representations to improve sample efficiency in off-policy RL, with theoretical analysis and strong empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous off-policy RL methods overlooked constraining initial input representations to address distribution shift and stabilize training, despite advances in architectures/algorithms.

Method: Introduces Constrained Initial Representations (CIR) framework with: (1) Tanh activation + normalization for stable representations, (2) skip connections for shallow-to-deep linear pathways, (3) convex Q-learning for flexible value estimation. Includes theoretical convergence analysis of TD learning with Tanh under linear approximation.

Result: CIR demonstrates strong performance on continuous control tasks, achieving competitive or superior results compared to existing strong baselines.

Conclusion: Constraining initial representations via Tanh combined with skip connections and convex Q-learning effectively enhances sample efficiency and training stability in off-policy RL.

Abstract: Recently, there have been numerous attempts to enhance the sample efficiency of off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) agents when interacting with the environment, including architecture improvements and new algorithms. Despite these advances, they overlook the potential of directly constraining the initial representations of the input data, which can intuitively alleviate the distribution shift issue and stabilize training. In this paper, we introduce the Tanh function into the initial layer to fulfill such a constraint. We theoretically unpack the convergence property of the temporal difference learning with the Tanh function under linear function approximation. Motivated by theoretical insights, we present our Constrained Initial Representations framework, tagged CIR, which is made up of three components: (i) the Tanh activation along with normalization methods to stabilize representations; (ii) the skip connection module to provide a linear pathway from the shallow layer to the deep layer; (iii) the convex Q-learning that allows a more flexible value estimate and mitigates potential conservatism. Empirical results show that CIR exhibits strong performance on numerous continuous control tasks, even being competitive or surpassing existing strong baseline methods.

Abstract: Accurate localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) from intracranial EEG (iEEG) is essential for epilepsy surgery but is challenged by complex spatiotemporal seizure dynamics. We propose SpaTeoGL, a spatiotemporal graph learning framework for interpretable seizure network analysis. SpaTeoGL jointly learns window-level spatial graphs capturing interactions among iEEG electrodes and a temporal graph linking time windows based on similarity of their spatial structure. The method is formulated within a smooth graph signal processing framework and solved via an alternating block coordinate descent algorithm with convergence guarantees. Experiments on a multicenter iEEG dataset with successful surgical outcomes show that SpaTeoGL is competitive with a baseline based on horizontal visibility graphs and logistic regression, while improving non-SOZ identification and providing interpretable insights into seizure onset and propagation dynamics.

Motivation: 标准路径签名将时序信息压缩为单一全局对象，难以满足需要逐步响应的决策需求，缺乏对瞬时轨迹更新的敏感性

Method: 1) 将截断路径签名分解为张量代数空间中时序有序的增量贡献序列；2) 在标准Transformer架构中集成ISC表示，无需额外结构修改

Result: 在HalfCheetah等4个机器人任务（含延迟奖励和数据降级设置）中，ISCT模型表现优异，验证了ISC方法的时序敏感性和稳定性

Conclusion: ISC方法为时序敏感控制任务提供了理论严谨且实用有效的路径处理新方案，拓展了路径签名在决策问题中的应用边界

Abstract: Path signatures embed trajectories into tensor algebra and constitute a universal, non-parametric representation of paths; however, in the standard form, they collapse temporal structure into a single global object, which limits their suitability for decision-making problems that require step-wise reactivity. We propose the Incremental Signature Contribution (ISC) method, which decomposes truncated path signatures into a temporally ordered sequence of elements in the tensor-algebra space, corresponding to incremental contributions induced by last path increments. This reconstruction preserves the algebraic structure and expressivity of signatures, while making their internal temporal evolution explicit, enabling processing signature-based representations via sequential modeling approaches. In contrast to full signatures, ISC is inherently sensitive to instantaneous trajectory updates, which is critical for sensitive and stability-requiring control dynamics. Building on this representation, we introduce ISC-Transformer (ISCT), an offline reinforcement learning model that integrates ISC into a standard Transformer architecture without further architectural modification. We evaluate ISCT on HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Hopper, and Maze2d, including settings with delayed rewards and downgraded datasets. The results demonstrate that ISC method provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative to path processing for temporally sensitive control tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气颗粒物毒性/吸湿性对健康气候影响重大，但需复杂观测或昂贵数值模拟才能获取，标记数据稀缺。常规观测（污染物浓度、气象）仅间接反映粒子属性，映射关系存在输入依赖的异方差噪声。在有限标注预算下，需智能选择采样对象，但标准主动学习将认知不确定性与偶然不确定性混淆，导致预算浪费在噪声主导区域。

Result: 在粒子分辨数值模拟和真实大气观测实验中，CAAL持续优于标准主动学习基线。

Conclusion: 为高效扩展高成本大气颗粒物属性数据库提供了实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantifying the impacts of air pollution on health and climate relies on key atmospheric particle properties such as toxicity and hygroscopicity. However, these properties typically require complex observational techniques or expensive particle-resolved numerical simulations, limiting the availability of labeled data. We therefore estimate these hard-to-measure particle properties from routinely available observations (e.g., air pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions). Because routine observations only indirectly reflect particle composition and structure, the mapping from routine observations to particle properties is noisy and input-dependent, yielding a heteroscedastic regression setting. With a limited and costly labeling budget, the central challenge is to select which samples to measure or simulate. While active learning is a natural approach, most acquisition strategies rely on predictive uncertainty. Under heteroscedastic noise, this signal conflates reducible epistemic uncertainty with irreducible aleatoric uncertainty, causing limited budgets to be wasted in noise-dominated regions. To address this challenge, we propose a confidence-aware active learning framework (CAAL) for efficient and robust sample selection in heteroscedastic settings. CAAL consists of two components: a decoupled uncertainty-aware training objective that separately optimises the predictive mean and noise level to stabilise uncertainty estimation, and a confidence-aware acquisition function that dynamically weights epistemic uncertainty using predicted aleatoric uncertainty as a reliability signal. Experiments on particle-resolved numerical simulations and real atmospheric observations show that CAAL consistently outperforms standard AL baselines. The proposed framework provides a practical and general solution for the efficient expansion of high-cost atmospheric particle property databases.

TL;DR: The paper formalizes intertemporal social dilemmas in the InvestESG multi-agent simulation and shows that Advantage Alignment opponent shaping can steer economic agents toward cooperative, socially beneficial outcomes for climate sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change mitigation faces a fundamental challenge where rational economic actors prioritize short-term profits over long-term collective welfare, creating intertemporal social dilemmas that hinder global coordination.

Method: The authors first provide a formal characterization of conditions leading to intertemporal social dilemmas in InvestESG by deriving theoretical thresholds where individual incentives diverge from collective welfare. Then they apply Advantage Alignment, a scalable opponent shaping algorithm designed for general-sum games, to influence agent learning dynamics in the simulation.

Result: Theoretical analysis demonstrates that Advantage Alignment systematically biases learning toward cooperative equilibria that favor socially beneficial outcomes, showing that strategic intervention in agent learning processes can produce better climate and sustainability results.

Conclusion: Strategically shaping economic agents' learning dynamics offers a promising approach to align market incentives with long-term sustainability goals, providing theoretical foundations for policy mechanisms to address climate-related social dilemmas.

Abstract: Addressing climate change requires global coordination, yet rational economic actors often prioritize immediate gains over collective welfare, resulting in social dilemmas. InvestESG is a recently proposed multi-agent simulation that captures the dynamic interplay between investors and companies under climate risk. We provide a formal characterization of the conditions under which InvestESG exhibits an intertemporal social dilemma, deriving theoretical thresholds at which individual incentives diverge from collective welfare. Building on this, we apply Advantage Alignment, a scalable opponent shaping algorithm shown to be effective in general-sum games, to influence agent learning in InvestESG. We offer theoretical insights into why Advantage Alignment systematically favors socially beneficial equilibria by biasing learning dynamics toward cooperative outcomes. Our results demonstrate that strategically shaping the learning processes of economic agents can result in better outcomes that could inform policy mechanisms to better align market incentives with long-term sustainability goals.

Abstract: Building upon recent structural disentanglement frameworks for sign language production, we propose A$^{2}$V-SLP, an alignment-aware variational framework that learns articulator-wise disentangled latent distributions rather than deterministic embeddings. A disentangled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes ground-truth sign pose sequences and extracts articulator-specific mean and variance vectors, which are used as distributional supervision for training a non-autoregressive Transformer. Given text embeddings, the Transformer predicts both latent means and log-variances, while the VAE decoder reconstructs the final sign pose sequences through stochastic sampling at the decoding stage. This formulation maintains articulator-level representations by avoiding deterministic latent collapse through distributional latent modeling. In addition, we integrate a gloss attention mechanism to strengthen alignment between linguistic input and articulated motion. Experimental results show consistent gains over deterministic latent regression, achieving state-of-the-art back-translation performance and improved motion realism in a fully gloss-free setting.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can learn from a few demonstrations provided at inference time. We study this in-context learning phenomenon through the lens of Gaussian Processes (GPs). We build controlled experiments where models observe sequences of multivariate scalar-valued function samples drawn from known GP priors. We evaluate prediction error in relation to the number of demonstrations and compare against two principled references: (i) an empirical GP-regression learner that gives a lower bound on achievable error, and (ii) the expected error of a 1-nearest-neighbor (1-NN) rule, which gives a data-driven upper bound. Across model sizes, we find that LLM learning curves are strongly influenced by the function-generating kernels and approach the GP lower bound as the number of demonstrations increases. We then study the inductive biases of these models using a likelihood-based analysis. We find that LLM predictions are most likely under less smooth GP kernels. Finally, we explore whether post-training can shift these inductive biases and improve sample-efficiency on functions sampled from GPs with smoother kernels. We find that both reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning can effectively shift inductive biases in the direction of the training data. Together, our framework quantifies the extent to which LLMs behave like GP learners and provides tools for steering their inductive biases for continuous function learning tasks.

### [86] [Where Bits Matter in World Model Planning: A Paired Mixed-Bit Study for Efficient Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11882)
*Suraj Ranganath,Anish Patnaik,Vaishak Menon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether low-bit spatial planning performance depends on total bitwidth or bit allocation across modules, revealing a three-regime pattern where 4-bit quantization is critically allocation-sensitive, motivating module-aware quantization policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial reasoning systems require reliable world models under tight precision budgets; existing quantization approaches lack understanding of how bit allocation across modules impacts planning behavior in low-bit regimes.

Method: Evaluated DINO-WM on Wall planning task using paired-goal mixed-bit analysis across uniform/mixed/asymmetric/layerwise quantization variants under two planner budgets, followed by a strict 22-cell replication with reduced episode count.

Result: Observed a consistent three-regime pattern: 8/6-bit settings match FP16 performance; 3-bit settings collapse; 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive where preserving encoder precision improves planning, though INT4 mixed-vs-uniform differences become budget-dependent in replication.

Conclusion: The transition regime (4-bit) is highly sensitive to bit allocation and experimental conditions, necessitating module-aware and budget-aware quantization policies for efficient spatial reasoning systems.

Abstract: Efficient spatial reasoning requires world models that remain reliable under tight precision budgets. We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime. These findings motivate module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies as a broader research direction for efficient spatial reasoning.

*Roberto Molinaro,Niall Siegenheim,Henry Martin,Mark Frey,Niels Poulsen,Philipp Seitz,Marvin Vincent Gabler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A universal diffusion model downscales low-res weather forecasts to high-res probabilistic predictions without fine-tuning, improving both accuracy and probabilistic skill across various weather models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weather forecasts need higher spatial resolution and better uncertainty quantification. Traditional downscaling requires model-specific tuning, limiting scalability. There's a need for a universal, model-agnostic approach to enhance operational forecasting pipelines.

Method: Train a single conditional diffusion model on paired coarse-resolution (~25km) and high-resolution (~5km) reanalysis data, then apply it zero-shot to deterministic forecasts from diverse AI and numerical weather prediction models to generate probabilistic high-resolution predictions.

Result: Downscaled forecasts consistently outperform raw model outputs, with substantially larger gains in probabilistic skill measured by CRPS across lead times up to 90h when evaluated against in situ observations.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based downscaling provides a scalable, model-agnostic probabilistic interface for enhancing spatial resolution and uncertainty representation in operational weather forecasting pipelines.

Abstract: We introduce a universal diffusion-based downscaling framework that lifts deterministic low-resolution weather forecasts into probabilistic high-resolution predictions without any model-specific fine-tuning. A single conditional diffusion model is trained on paired coarse-resolution inputs (~25 km resolution) and high-resolution regional reanalysis targets (~5 km resolution), and is applied in a fully zero-shot manner to deterministic forecasts from heterogeneous upstream weather models. Focusing on near-surface variables, we evaluate probabilistic forecasts against independent in situ station observations over lead times up to 90 h. Across a diverse set of AI-based and numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, the ensemble mean of the downscaled forecasts consistently improves upon each model's own raw deterministic forecast, and substantially larger gains are observed in probabilistic skill as measured by CRPS. These results demonstrate that diffusion-based downscaling provides a scalable, model-agnostic probabilistic interface for enhancing spatial resolution and uncertainty representation in operational weather forecasting pipelines.

### [88] [Mitigating Mismatch within Reference-based Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11902)
*Suqin Yuan,Xingrui Yu,Jiyang Zheng,Lei Feng,Dadong Wang,Ivor Tsang,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyPO (Hybrid-DPO) fixes DPO's "premature satisfaction" problem by conditionally using the reference model - only when it's optimistic/neutral, treating it as neutral when pessimistic. This one-line change improves alignment performance without extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO's reliance on a reference policy causes premature satisfaction on pessimistic preference pairs, where the reference prefers the rejected response. This creates training-inference mismatch and limits learning signals even when the policy is still incorrect.

Method: HyPO modifies DPO with a conditional reference mechanism: it uses the standard DPO objective when the reference is optimistic/neutral, but replaces the reference margin with max{0,Δ_ref} when pessimistic. This simple one-line change strengthens learning signals on problematic pairs while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: Empirically, HyPO mitigates premature satisfaction, improves inference-aligned metrics, and achieves higher pairwise win rates across preference alignment tasks compared to standard DPO.

Conclusion: Direct preference alignment can be enhanced by conditionally debiasing the reference signal rather than discarding it entirely, preserving both stability and learning effectiveness.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become the de facto standard for offline preference alignment of large language models, but its reliance on a reference policy introduces a critical tension. DPO weighs each update relative to a reference, which stabilizes the training by regularizing the updates within a trusted region. This reliance becomes problematic for pessimistic pairs, where the reference model prefers the rejected response. For these pairs, DPO prematurely attenuates the gradient as soon as the policy margin ($Δ_θ$) merely beats the reference margin ($Δ_{\mathrm{ref}}$) even if the policy is still wrong ($Δ_θ<0$). We name this failure premature satisfaction, which is a concrete form of the training-inference mismatch. Reference-free objectives remove this mismatch by optimizing the absolute margin, but at the cost of discarding the stabilizing signal of the reference. We mitigate this tension with Hybrid-DPO (HyPO), a drop-in modification to DPO that applies reference conditionally: HyPO behaves exactly like DPO when the reference is optimistic or neutral, and it treats the reference as neutral when it is pessimistic by replacing $Δ_θ-Δ_{\mathrm{ref}}$ with $Δ_θ-\max\{0,Δ_{\mathrm{ref}}\}$. This one-line change strictly strengthens per-example learning signals on pessimistic pairs while preserving DPO's objective form and computational cost. By conditionally debiasing the pessimistic reference signal, HyPO mitigates premature satisfaction; empirically, across preference alignment, HyPO improves inference-aligned metrics and achieves higher pairwise win rates. Our results provide evidence that direct preference alignment could be enhanced by conditionally debiasing the reference signal, rather than discarding it.

Conclusion: 该工作架起了经典PAC理论与实际应用需求的桥梁，为邻域平均学习提供了理论基础，其组合参数为后续算法设计指明方向。

Abstract: We introduce the problem of learning conditional averages in the PAC framework. The learner receives a sample labeled by an unknown target concept from a known concept class, as in standard PAC learning. However, instead of learning the target concept itself, the goal is to predict, for each instance, the average label over its neighborhood -- an arbitrary subset of points that contains the instance. In the degenerate case where all neighborhoods are singletons, the problem reduces exactly to classic PAC learning. More generally, it extends PAC learning to a setting that captures learning tasks arising in several domains, including explainability, fairness, and recommendation systems. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of when conditional averages are learnable, together with sample complexity bounds that are tight up to logarithmic factors. The characterization hinges on the joint finiteness of two novel combinatorial parameters, which depend on both the concept class and the neighborhood system, and are closely related to the independence number of the associated neighborhood graph.

TL;DR: 该论文针对推理型大语言模型因生成长推理链导致服务成本激增的问题，通过扩展Puzzle神经架构搜索框架，从gpt-oss-120B优化出gpt-oss-puzzle-88B，在保持准确率的同时实现显著吞吐量提升，并倡导使用请求级效率指标评估模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理型大语言模型通过生成长推理链提升答案质量，但额外token会大幅增加服务成本，因此需要在不牺牲质量的前提下进行推理优化以降低成本。

Method: 将Puzzle后训练神经架构搜索框架应用于gpt-oss-120B，结合异构MoE专家剪枝、选择性窗口注意力替换、FP8 KV缓存量化及校准、后训练强化学习等技术，在保持低生成长度的同时恢复准确率。

Result: 在8XH100节点上，长上下文和短上下文设置分别实现1.63倍和1.22倍每token吞吐量加速；单块H100 GPU上达到2.82倍加速。请求级效率最高提升1.29倍。gpt-oss-puzzle-88B在各类基准测试中准确率达到父模型的100.8%至108.2%，整体持平或略超。

Conclusion: 后训练架构搜索能显著降低推理成本而不牺牲质量。论文强调由于推理链长度可变，单token指标不能反映端到端加速，应使用按生成token归一化的请求级效率指标，并绘制准确率-速度前沿来全面评估模型效率。

Abstract: Reasoning-focused LLMs improve answer quality by generating longer reasoning traces, but the additional tokens dramatically increase serving cost, motivating inference optimization. We extend and apply Puzzle, a post-training neural architecture search (NAS) framework, to gpt-oss-120B to produce gpt-oss-puzzle-88B, a deployment-optimized derivative. Our approach combines heterogeneous MoE expert pruning, selective replacement of full-context attention with window attention, FP8 KV-cache quantization with calibrated scales, and post-training reinforcement learning to recover accuracy, while maintaining low generation length. In terms of per-token speeds, on an 8XH100 node we achieve 1.63X and 1.22X throughput speedups in long-context and short-context settings, respectively. gpt-oss-puzzle-88B also delivers throughput speedups of 2.82X on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. However, because token counts can change with reasoning effort and model variants, per-token throughput (tok/s) and latency (ms/token) do not necessarily lead to end-to-end speedups: a 2X throughput gain is erased if traces grow 2X. Conversely, throughput gains can be spent on more reasoning tokens to improve accuracy; we therefore advocate request-level efficiency metrics that normalize throughput by tokens generated and trace an accuracy--speed frontier across reasoning efforts. We show that gpt-oss-puzzle-88B improves over gpt-oss-120B along the entire frontier, delivering up to 1.29X higher request-level efficiency. Across various benchmarks, gpt-oss-puzzle-88B matches or slightly exceeds the parent on suite-average accuracy across reasoning efforts, with retention ranging from 100.8% (high) to 108.2% (low), showing that post-training architecture search can substantially reduce inference costs without sacrificing quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列对抗攻击方法忽略数据固有的时序一致性，导致同一时间戳在不同重叠样本中产生矛盾扰动，使攻击在现实场景中难以实现有效数据操控。

Method: 1. 提出时序统一对抗扰动（TUAPs），约束同一时间戳在所有重叠样本中的扰动必须一致。
2. 设计时间戳梯度累积法（TGAM），模块化聚合重叠样本的局部梯度信息以高效生成TUAPs。
3. 将TGAM与动量攻击算法结合，在保持严格时序一致性的同时利用序列级梯度探索扰动空间。

Result: 在3个基准数据集和4种SOTA模型上的实验表明：所提方法在TUAP约束下，白盒/黑盒迁移攻击性能显著优于基线；即使无TUAP约束，其迁移攻击效果仍具优势。

Conclusion: TUAPs和TGAM有效解决了时序对抗攻击中的关键一致性问题，为提升时间序列预测模型的安全性提供了实用且高效的新方案。

Abstract: While deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in time series forecasting, their vulnerability to adversarial examples remains a critical security concern. However, existing attack methods in the forecasting field typically ignore the temporal consistency inherent in time series data, leading to divergent and contradictory perturbation values for the same timestamp across overlapping samples. This temporally inconsistent perturbations problem renders adversarial attacks impractical for real-world data manipulation. To address this, we introduce Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs), which enforce a temporal unification constraint to ensure identical perturbations for each timestamp across all overlapping samples. Moreover, we propose a novel Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) that provides a modular and efficient approach to effectively generate TUAPs by aggregating local gradient information from overlapping samples. By integrating TGAM with momentum-based attack algorithms, we ensure strict temporal consistency while fully utilizing series-level gradient information to explore the adversarial perturbation space. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four representative state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baselines in both white-box and black-box transfer attack scenarios under TUAP constraints. Moreover, our method also exhibits superior transfer attack performance even without TUAP constraints, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in generating adversarial perturbations for time series forecasting models.

Abstract: When building AI systems for decision support, one often encounters the phenomenon of predictive multiplicity: a single best model does not exist; instead, one can construct many models with similar overall accuracy that differ in their predictions for individual cases. Especially when decisions have a direct impact on humans, this can be highly unsatisfactory. For a person subject to high disagreement between models, one could as well have chosen a different model of similar overall accuracy that would have decided the person's case differently. We argue that this arbitrariness conflicts with the EU AI Act, which requires providers of high-risk AI systems to report performance not only at the dataset level but also for specific persons. The goal of this paper is to put predictive multiplicity in context with the EU AI Act's provisions on accuracy and to subsequently derive concrete suggestions on how to evaluate and report predictive multiplicity in practice. Specifically: (1) We argue that incorporating information about predictive multiplicity can serve compliance with the EU AI Act's accuracy provisions for providers. (2) Based on this legal analysis, we suggest individual conflict ratios and $δ$-ambiguity as tools to quantify the disagreement between models on individual cases and to help detect individuals subject to conflicting predictions. (3) Based on computational insights, we derive easy-to-implement rules on how model providers could evaluate predictive multiplicity in practice. (4) Ultimately, we suggest that information about predictive multiplicity should be made available to deployers under the AI Act, enabling them to judge whether system outputs for specific individuals are reliable enough for their use case.

Result: 大量实验表明，PMFL在异构场景下优于现有联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: PMFL框架通过利用历史训练信息和节点参与模式，有效解决了联邦学习中的异构性挑战，实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple nodes to collaboratively train a model without sharing raw data. However, FL systems are usually deployed in heterogeneous scenarios, where nodes differ in both data distributions and participation frequencies, which undermines the FL performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper proposes PMFL, a performance-enhanced model-contrastive federated learning framework using historical training information. Specifically, on the node side, we design a novel model-contrastive term into the node optimization objective by incorporating historical local models to capture stable contrastive points, thereby improving the consistency of model updates in heterogeneous data distributions.
  On the server side, we utilize the cumulative participation count of each node to adaptively adjust its aggregation weight, thereby correcting the bias in the global objective caused by different node participation frequencies. Furthermore, the updated global model incorporates historical global models to reduce its fluctuations in performance between adjacent rounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PMFL achieves superior performance compared with existing FL methods in heterogeneous scenarios.

*Kaicheng Xiao,Haotian Li,Liran Dong,Guoliang Xing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAM-Net uses sparse addressing to achieve exponential memory scaling without extra parameters, outperforming linear attention in long-range tasks while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention architectures, despite efficient inference, suffer from limited expressivity and information loss because they compress unbounded history into fixed-size memory, creating a gap with the representational capacity of full attention.

Method: RAM-Net maps inputs to high-dimensional sparse vectors serving as explicit addresses for selective access to a massive memory state, enabling exponential state size scaling without additional parameters while maintaining sparsity for computational efficiency.

Result: The model surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in fine-grained long-range retrieval tasks and achieves competitive performance in standard language modeling and zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: RAM-Net successfully bridges the gap between full attention's representational capacity and linear attention's memory efficiency, capturing complex dependencies with significantly reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: While linear attention architectures offer efficient inference, compressing unbounded history into a fixed-size memory inherently limits expressivity and causes information loss. To address this limitation, we introduce Random Access Memory Network (RAM-Net), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between the representational capacity of full attention and the memory efficiency of linear models. The core of RAM-Net maps inputs to high-dimensional sparse vectors serving as explicit addresses, allowing the model to selectively access a massive memory state. This design enables exponential state size scaling without additional parameters, which significantly mitigates signal interference and enhances retrieval fidelity. Moreover, the inherent sparsity ensures exceptional computational efficiency, as state updates are confined to minimal entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM-Net consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in fine-grained long-range retrieval tasks and achieves competitive performance in standard language modeling and zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks, validating its superior capability to capture complex dependencies with significantly reduced computational overhead.

TL;DR: 该论文针对大型语言模型在实际部署中面临的时序分布偏移问题，提出了MaT-LoRA方法，通过几何重构在参数高效微调框架下实现低维流形上的时序建模，显著降低计算复杂度同时保持模型表现力。

Abstract: Temporal distribution shifts are pervasive in real-world deployments of Large Language Models (LLMs), where data evolves continuously over time. While Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to model such structured evolution, existing approaches characterize model adaptation in the full parameter space. This formulation becomes computationally infeasible for modern LLMs. This paper introduces a geometric reformulation of TDG under parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We establish that the low-dimensional temporal structure underlying model evolution can be preserved under parameter-efficient reparameterization, enabling temporal modeling without operating in the ambient parameter space. Building on this principle, we propose Manifold-aware Temporal LoRA (MaT-LoRA), which constrains temporal updates to a shared low-dimensional manifold within a low-rank adaptation subspace, and models its evolution through a structured temporal core. This reparameterization dramatically reduces temporal modeling complexity while retaining expressive power. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including scientific documents, news publishers, and review ratings, demonstrate that MaT-LoRA achieves superior temporal generalization performance with practical scalability for LLMs.

Abstract: In large-scale data processing scenarios, data often arrive in sequential streams generated by complex systems that exhibit drifting distributions and time-varying system parameters. This nonstationarity challenges theoretical analysis, as it violates classical assumptions of i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) samples, necessitating algorithms capable of real-time updates without expensive retraining. An effective approach should process each sample in a single pass, while maintaining computational and memory complexities independent of the data stream length. Motivated by these challenges, this paper investigates the Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm as an adaptive identification tool, leveraging its computational simplicity and online processing capabilities. Theoretically, we derive tracking performance and regret bounds for the MLMS in time-varying stochastic linear systems under various practical conditions. Unlike classical LMS, whose stability can be characterized by first-order random vector difference equations, MLMS introduces an additional dynamical state due to momentum, leading to second-order time-varying random vector difference equations whose stability analysis hinges on more complicated products of random matrices, which poses a substantially challenging problem to resolve. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that MLMS achieves rapid adaptation and robust tracking, in agreement with our theoretical results especially in nonstationary settings, highlighting its promise for modern streaming and online learning applications.

Motivation: Real-world deployments of Federated Neuromorphic Learning require additional privacy mechanisms like Differential Privacy, but these mechanisms significantly alter training signals. There is a need to understand how these perturbations affect neuromorphic learning coordination.

Method: The paper analyzes the impact of DP mechanisms (gradient clipping and noise injection) on firing-rate statistics in SNNs and their propagation to rate-based FNL coordination. Ablation studies were conducted across privacy budgets and clipping bounds on a speech recognition task under non-IID settings.

Result: The study revealed systematic rate shifts, attenuated aggregation, and ranking instability during client selection. These shifts were related to sparsity and memory indicators in the network.

Abstract: Federated Neuromorphic Learning (FNL) enables energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning on devices without centralizing data. However, real-world deployments require additional privacy mechanisms that can significantly alter training signals. This paper analyzes how Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms, specifically gradient clipping and noise injection, perturb firing-rate statistics in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and how these perturbations are propagated to rate-based FNL coordination. On a speech recognition task under non-IID settings, ablations across privacy budgets and clipping bounds reveal systematic rate shifts, attenuated aggregation, and ranking instability during client selection. Moreover, we relate these shifts to sparsity and memory indicators. Our findings provide actionable guidance for privacy-preserving FNL, specifically regarding the balance between privacy strength and rate-dependent coordination.

*Gongxi Zhu,Hanlin Gu,Lixin Fan,Qiang Yang,Yuxing Han*

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving federated learning framework FedGRPO that uses reinforcement learning and expert selection to enhance server model performance by exchanging only reward signals instead of data or model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FedFMs methods based on model/representation-level knowledge transfer suffer from expensive local training, high communication costs, and unavoidable privacy risks, necessitating more efficient and privacy-preserving approaches.

Method: Reformulates the problem as a reinforcement learning evaluation process with two modules: (1) competence-based expert selection via a lightweight confidence graph to identify suitable clients for each query; (2) leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to package queries with rationales as candidate policies, dispatches them to selected clients, and aggregates only scalar reward signals through a federated group-relative loss function.

Result: Empirical evaluation on diverse domain tasks demonstrates that FedGRPO achieves superior downstream accuracy and communication efficiency compared to conventional FedFMs baselines.

Conclusion: By exchanging reward values instead of data or model parameters, FedGRPO successfully reduces privacy risks and communication overhead while enabling parallel evaluation across heterogeneous devices, offering an effective solution for federated foundation model enhancement.

Abstract: One important direction of Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) is leveraging data from small client models to enhance the performance of a large server-side foundation model. Existing methods based on model level or representation level knowledge transfer either require expensive local training or incur high communication costs and introduce unavoidable privacy risks. We reformulate this problem as a reinforcement learning style evaluation process and propose FedGRPO, a privacy preserving framework comprising two modules. The first module performs competence-based expert selection by building a lightweight confidence graph from auxiliary data to identify the most suitable clients for each question. The second module leverages the "Group Relative" concept from the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by packaging each question together with its solution rationale into candidate policies, dispatching these policies to a selected subset of expert clients, and aggregating solely the resulting scalar reward signals via a federated group-relative loss function. By exchanging reward values instead of data or model updates, FedGRPO reduces privacy risk and communication overhead while enabling parallel evaluation across heterogeneous devices. Empirical results on diverse domain tasks demonstrate that FedGRPO achieves superior downstream accuracy and communication efficiency compared to conventional FedFMs baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 针对多智能体系统中多个语言模型重复处理相同prompt导致预填充冗余和KV缓存浪费的问题，本文提出PrefillShare算法，通过将模型分解为预填充和解码模块并共享预填充模块，在保持精度的同时显著降低延迟并提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统日益依赖多个专用语言模型协同解决复杂问题，这些模型常在共享上下文中重复执行相同的prompt前缀，导致每个模型都要独立进行预填充计算并维护各自的KV缓存，这不仅增加了总体预填充负载，还加剧了预填充-解码干扰，恶化了尾延迟。现有的分离式服务部署虽能减轻干扰，但无法从根本上消除相同prompt在多个模型间的计算和存储冗余。

Method: 提出PrefillShare算法，将模型分解为预填充和解码两个模块，冻结预填充模块仅微调解码模块，使多个任务特定模型可以共享同一个预填充模块和对应的KV缓存。同时设计了一个路由机制，在基于vLLM的分离式系统中实现异构模型间的有效预填充共享。

Result: PrefillShare在广泛的任务和模型上都能达到与完全微调相当的精度，同时在多模型智能体工作负载下实现了4.5倍的p95延迟降低和3.9倍的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: PrefillShare通过共享预填充计算和KV缓存，有效解决了多模型系统中的冗余问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了系统效率，为多智能体语言模型服务提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems increasingly orchestrate multiple specialized language models to solve complex real-world problems, often invoking them over a shared context. This execution pattern repeatedly processes the same prompt prefix across models. Consequently, each model redundantly executes the prefill stage and maintains its own key-value (KV) cache, increasing aggregate prefill load and worsening tail latency by intensifying prefill-decode interference in existing LLM serving stacks. Disaggregated serving reduces such interference by placing prefill and decode on separate GPUs, but disaggregation does not fundamentally eliminate inter-model redundancy in computation and KV storage for the same prompt. To address this issue, we propose PrefillShare, a novel algorithm that enables sharing the prefill stage across multiple models in a disaggregated setting. PrefillShare factorizes the model into prefill and decode modules, freezes the prefill module, and fine-tunes only the decode module. This design allows multiple task-specific models to share a prefill module and the KV cache generated for the same prompt. We further introduce a routing mechanism that enables effective prefill sharing across heterogeneous models in a vLLM-based disaggregated system. PrefillShare not only matches full fine-tuning accuracy on a broad range of tasks and models, but also delivers 4.5x lower p95 latency and 3.9x higher throughput in multi-model agent workloads.

Conclusion: 该傅里叶表示法原生支持周期性，可通过简单代数运算处理空间群对称性，自然支持生成过程中的可变原子数量，为晶体生成建模提供了有前景的方案。

Abstract: The discovery of new crystalline materials calls for generative models that handle periodic boundary conditions, crystallographic symmetries, and physical constraints, while scaling to large and structurally diverse unit cells. We propose a reciprocal-space generative pipeline that represents crystals through a truncated Fourier transform of the species-resolved unit-cell density, rather than modeling atomic coordinates directly. This representation is periodicity-native, admits simple algebraic actions of space-group symmetries, and naturally supports variable atomic multiplicities during generation, addressing a common limitation of particle-based approaches. Using only nine Fourier basis functions per spatial dimension, our approach reconstructs unit cells containing up to 108 atoms per chemical species. We instantiate this pipeline with a transformer variational autoencoder over complex-valued Fourier coefficients, and a latent diffusion model that generates in the compressed latent space. We evaluate reconstruction and latent diffusion on the LeMaterial benchmark and compare unconditional generation against coordinate-based baselines in the small-cell regime ($\leq 16$ atoms per unit cell).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong code generation capabilities, yet the runtime performance of generated code is not guaranteed, and there have been few attempts to train LLMs using runtime performance as a reward in the HPC domain. We propose an online reinforcement learning approach that executes LLM-generated code on a supercomputer and directly feeds back the measured runtime performance (GFLOPS) as a reward. We further introduce a Staged Quality-Diversity (SQD) algorithm that progressively varies the permitted optimization techniques on a per-problem basis, enabling the model to learn code optimization from diverse perspectives. We build a distributed system connecting a GPU training cluster with a CPU benchmarking cluster, and train Qwen2.5 Coder 14B on a double-precision matrix multiplication task using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through two experiments, we show that reinforcement learning combining runtime performance feedback with staged optimization can improve the HPC code generation capability of LLMs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, event data collection in soccer still relies heavily on labor-intensive manual annotation. Although prior work has explored automatic event detection using player and ball trajectories, ball tracking also remains difficult to scale due to high infrastructural and operational costs. As a result, comprehensive data collection in soccer is largely confined to top-tier competitions, limiting the broader adoption of data-driven analysis in this domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes PathCRF, a framework for detecting on-ball soccer events using only player tracking data. We model player trajectories as a fully connected dynamic graph and formulate event detection as the problem of selecting exactly one edge corresponding to the current possession state at each time step. To ensure logical consistency of the resulting edge sequence, we employ a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that forbids impossible transitions between consecutive edges. Both emission and transition scores dynamically computed from edge embeddings produced by a Set Attention-based backbone architecture. During inference, the most probable edge sequence is obtained via Viterbi decoding, and events such as ball controls or passes are detected whenever the selected edge changes between adjacent time steps. Experiments show that PathCRF produces accurate, logically consistent possession paths, enabling reliable downstream analyses while substantially reducing the need for manual event annotation.

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful and widely used probabilistic regression models, but their effectiveness in practice is often limited by the choice of kernel function. This kernel function is typically handcrafted from a small set of standard functions, a process that requires expert knowledge, results in limited adaptivity to data, and imposes strong assumptions on the hypothesis space. We study Empirical GPs, a principled framework for constructing flexible, data-driven GP priors that overcome these limitations. Rather than relying on standard parametric kernels, we estimate the mean and covariance functions empirically from a corpus of historical observations, enabling the prior to reflect rich, non-trivial covariance structures present in the data. Theoretically, we show that the resulting model converges to the GP that is closest (in KL-divergence sense) to the real data generating process. Practically, we formulate the problem of learning the GP prior from independent datasets as likelihood estimation and derive an Expectation-Maximization algorithm with closed-form updates, allowing the model handle heterogeneous observation locations across datasets. We demonstrate that Empirical GPs achieve competitive performance on learning curve extrapolation and time series forecasting benchmarks.

Abstract: Estimating the state of an environment from high-dimensional, multimodal, and noisy observations is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional approaches rely on probabilistic models to account for the uncertainty, but often require explicit noise assumptions, in turn limiting generalization. In this work, we contribute a novel method to learn a structured latent representation, in which distances between states directly correlate with the minimum number of actions required to transition between them. The proposed metric space formulation provides a geometric interpretation of uncertainty without the need for explicit probabilistic modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a multimodal latent transition model and a sensor fusion mechanism based on inverse distance weighting, allowing for the adaptive integration of multiple sensor modalities without prior knowledge of noise distributions. We empirically validate the approach on a range of multimodal RL tasks, demonstrating improved robustness to sensor noise and superior state estimation compared to baseline methods. Our experiments show enhanced performance of an RL agent via the learned representation, eliminating the need of explicit noise augmentation. The presented results suggest that leveraging transition-aware metric spaces provides a principled and scalable solution for robust state estimation in sequential decision-making.

TL;DR: This paper studies offline reinforcement learning under Q*-approximation and partial coverage, answering a key open question negatively by showing Q*-realizability and Bellman completeness alone are insufficient for sample efficiency. It introduces a general decision-estimation framework that characterizes Q* complexity, achieving improved ε⁻² sample bounds and extending analysis to low-Bellman-rank MDPs and CQL beyond tabular settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses offline RL under Q*-approximation and partial coverage, motivated by practical algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) but limited theoretical understanding. Tackles the open question of whether Q*-realizability and Bellman completeness are sufficient for sample-efficient offline RL.

Method: Establishes an information-theoretic lower bound to answer the open question negatively. Introduces a general framework based on decision-estimation coefficients (DEC) to characterize Q* complexity, and develops a novel second-order performance difference lemma. The framework is modular and can be combined with various Q* estimation procedures.

Result: (1) Negative answer to the open question; (2) General framework improving upon prior work; (3) First ε⁻² sample complexity for soft Q-learning under partial coverage; (4) Removal of need for online interaction when value gap is unknown; (5) First offline learnability characterization for low-Bellman-rank MDPs without Bellman completeness; (6) First non-tabular analysis of CQL.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for offline RL under partial coverage, settling an important open question and achieving tighter sample complexity bounds while extending analysis to broader settings including low-Bellman-rank MDPs and practical algorithms like CQL.

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning under $Q^\star$-approximation and partial coverage, a setting that motivates practical algorithms such as Conservative $Q$-Learning (CQL; Kumar et al., 2020) but has received limited theoretical attention. Our work is inspired by the following open question: "Are $Q^\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness sufficient for sample-efficient offline RL under partial coverage?"
  We answer in the negative by establishing an information-theoretic lower bound. Going substantially beyond this, we introduce a general framework that characterizes the intrinsic complexity of a given $Q^\star$ function class, inspired by model-free decision-estimation coefficients (DEC) for online RL (Foster et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2025b). This complexity recovers and improves the quantities underlying the guarantees of Chen and Jiang (2022) and Uehara et al. (2023), and extends to broader settings. Our decision-estimation decomposition can be combined with a wide range of $Q^\star$ estimation procedures, modularizing and generalizing existing approaches.
  Beyond the general framework, we make further contributions: By developing a novel second-order performance difference lemma, we obtain the first $ε^{-2}$ sample complexity under partial coverage for soft $Q$-learning, improving the $ε^{-4}$ bound of Uehara et al. (2023). We remove Chen and Jiang's (2022) need for additional online interaction when the value gap of $Q^\star$ is unknown. We also give the first characterization of offline learnability for general low-Bellman-rank MDPs without Bellman completeness (Jiang et al., 2017; Du et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2021), a canonical setting in online RL that remains unexplored in offline RL except for special cases. Finally, we provide the first analysis for CQL under $Q^\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness beyond the tabular case.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-Sel是一种轻量级监督元学习方法，通过TF-IDF相似度和长度兼容性比率两个低成本特征，为候选示例-查询对构建可解释评分函数，实现高效演示选择


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在上下文学习中，有限的提示词预算下演示示例的选择显著影响模型准确率，但现有方法要么计算成本高（如需在线探索或大模型调用），要么效果不稳定，亟需一种既廉价又高效的演示选择方案

Method: 从训练数据构建元数据集，以类别一致性作为监督信号；训练校准的逻辑回归模型，使用TF-IDF余弦相似度和长度兼容比率作为元特征；推理时通过单次向量化评分从候选池选出Top-k示例，无需微调或额外大模型调用

Result: 在4个意图数据集和5个开源大模型的基准测试中，Meta-Sel在12种方法中持续表现优异，尤其能弥补小模型容量限制，且选择时间开销具有竞争力

Conclusion: Meta-Sel提供了一种无需微调、计算高效且可解释的演示选择机制，为上下文学习中的实际部署瓶颈提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Demonstration selection is a practical bottleneck in in-context learning (ICL): under a tight prompt budget, accuracy can change substantially depending on which few-shot examples are included, yet selection must remain cheap enough to run per query over large candidate pools. We propose Meta-Sel, a lightweight supervised meta-learning approach for intent classification that learns a fast, interpretable scoring function for (candidate, query) pairs from labeled training data.
  Meta-Sel constructs a meta-dataset by sampling pairs from the training split and using class agreement as supervision, then trains a calibrated logistic regressor on two inexpensive meta-features: TF--IDF cosine similarity and a length-compatibility ratio. At inference time, the selector performs a single vectorized scoring pass over the full candidate pool and returns the top-k demonstrations, requiring no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls. This yields deterministic rankings and makes the selection mechanism straightforward to audit via interpretable feature weights.
  Beyond proposing Meta-Sel, we provide a broad empirical study of demonstration selection, benchmarking 12 methods -- spanning prompt engineering baselines, heuristic selection, reinforcement learning, and influence-based approaches -- across four intent datasets and five open-source LLMs. Across this benchmark, Meta-Sel consistently ranks among the top-performing methods, is particularly effective for smaller models where selection quality can partially compensate for limited model capacity, and maintains competitive selection-time overhead.

Conclusion: 工作为OPD提供了理论基石和实践洞见，揭示了奖励缩放和参考模型选择的关键作用，为未来蒸馏研究开辟了新方向，特别是性能超越教师的可能性。

Abstract: On-policy distillation (OPD), which aligns the student with the teacher's logit distribution on student-generated trajectories, has demonstrated strong empirical gains in improving student performance and often outperforms off-policy distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms. In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD.

TL;DR: 提出非侵入式评估协议PhyIP，通过冻结表征线性解码物理量来验证神经模型是否内化物理规律，发现低容量探针比微调等适配方法更能准确评估物理世界模型的潜在结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如微调或高容量探针）会改变模型表征，混淆自监督学习阶段实际学到的内容，难以区分模型是内化物理规律还是仅利用统计捷径，尤其在分布外测试时

Method: 提出PhyIP协议：冻结自监督学习模型表征，基于线性表征假说检验物理量是否可从表征中线性解码，在流体力学和轨道力学任务中验证

Result: 当自监督学习误差低时，潜在物理结构（如内能、牛顿平方反比律）在线性解码中高度可访问（OOD测试ρ>0.90），而适配方法会破坏该结构（ρ≈0.05）

Conclusion: 适配式评估会掩盖潜在物理结构，低容量线性探针能更准确评估模型是否真正内化物理世界模型，为神经科学提供可靠评估范式

Abstract: Determining whether neural models internalize physical laws as world models, rather than exploiting statistical shortcuts, remains challenging, especially under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts. Standard evaluations often test latent capability via downstream adaptation (e.g., fine-tuning or high-capacity probes), but such interventions can change the representations being measured and thus confound what was learned during self-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $ρ> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($ρ\approx 0.05$). These findings suggest that adaptation-based evaluation can obscure latent structures and that low-capacity probes offer a more accurate evaluation of physical world models.

Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)计算效率高但泛化能力弱于强化学习(RL)，主要原因是RL使用策略内数据而SFT不能。需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出分布判别理论(DDT)解释量化数据与模型分布的对齐程度；基于DDT开发两种互补技术：1)分布内微调(IDFT)通过损失函数增强SFT泛化能力；2)提示解码通过数据层面重对齐训练语料到模型分布。

Result: 实验表明该框架的泛化性能可与DPO和SimPO等先进离线RL算法媲美，同时保持SFT的计算效率。

Conclusion: 为RL不可行的领域提供了实用替代方案，成功实现了高效且高性能的策略内微调。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is computationally efficient but often yields inferior generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). This gap is primarily driven by RL's use of on-policy data. We propose a framework to bridge this chasm by enabling On-Policy SFT. We first present \textbf{\textit{Distribution Discriminant Theory (DDT)}}, which explains and quantifies the alignment between data and the model-induced distribution. Leveraging DDT, we introduce two complementary techniques: (i) \textbf{\textit{In-Distribution Finetuning (IDFT)}}, a loss-level method to enhance generalization ability of SFT, and (ii) \textbf{\textit{Hinted Decoding}}, a data-level technique that can re-align the training corpus to the model's distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves generalization performance on par with prominent offline RL algorithms, including DPO and SimPO, while maintaining the efficiency of an SFT pipeline. The proposed framework thus offers a practical alternative in domains where RL is infeasible. We open-source the code here: https://github.com/zhangmiaosen2000/Towards-On-Policy-SFT

Method: 采用具有闭式解的线性阻尼谐振子替代神经ODE，将键值建模为阻尼受迫振荡器，查询展开为正弦基函数，将注意力建模为共振现象。

Conclusion: 该振荡器参数化保持了连续时间注意力的通用近似性质，为不规则时序建模提供了理论保证与可扩展性的统一方案。

Abstract: Transformers excel at time series modelling through attention mechanisms that capture long-term temporal patterns. However, they assume uniform time intervals and therefore struggle with irregular time series. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) effectively handle irregular time series by modelling hidden states as continuously evolving trajectories. ContiFormers arxiv:2402.10635 combine NODEs with Transformers, but inherit the computational bottleneck of the former by using heavy numerical solvers. This bottleneck can be removed by using a closed-form solution for the given dynamical system - but this is known to be intractable in general! We obviate this by replacing NODEs with a novel linear damped harmonic oscillator analogy - which has a known closed-form solution. We model keys and values as damped, driven oscillators and expand the query in a sinusoidal basis up to a suitable number of modes. This analogy naturally captures the query-key coupling that is fundamental to any transformer architecture by modelling attention as a resonance phenomenon. Our closed-form solution eliminates the computational overhead of numerical ODE solvers while preserving expressivity. We prove that this oscillator-based parameterisation maintains the universal approximation property of continuous-time attention; specifically, any discrete attention matrix realisable by ContiFormer's continuous keys can be approximated arbitrarily well by our fixed oscillator modes. Our approach delivers both theoretical guarantees and scalability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on irregular time series benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Olmix is a framework for efficient data mixing in language model training that addresses two key challenges: understanding the configuration space of mixing methods and handling evolving domain sets through mixture reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data mixing ratios are crucial for training language models, but existing methods fall short in real-world development because: (1) the configuration space for mixing methods lacks understanding and justification, and (2) they assume fixed domains while real-world domains evolve through additions, removals, and revisions during development.

Method: The paper presents Olmix framework with two components: (1) a comprehensive empirical study identifying key design choices for effective mixing methods, and (2) mixture reuse mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes only for affected domains when domain sets are updated, leveraging past mixture information.

Result: Over five domain-set updates mirroring real-world LM development, mixture reuse achieves performance matching full recomputation while using 74% less compute, and improves over training without mixing by 11.6% on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Olmix successfully addresses practical challenges in data mixing for LM development by providing a better understanding of mixing configuration space and an efficient mechanism for handling evolving domain sets, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Data mixing -- determining the ratios of data from different domains -- is a first-order concern for training language models (LMs). While existing mixing methods show promise, they fall short when applied during real-world LM development. We present Olmix, a framework that addresses two such challenges. First, the configuration space for developing a mixing method is not well understood -- design choices across existing methods lack justification or consensus and overlook practical issues like data constraints. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method. Second, in practice, the domain set evolves throughout LM development as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised -- a problem setting largely unaddressed by existing works, which assume fixed domains. We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update. Over a sequence of five domain-set updates mirroring real-world LM development, mixture reuse matches the performance of fully recomputing the mix after each update with 74% less compute and improves over training without mixing by 11.6% on downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有基准存在四大缺陷：数据组成受限于重复使用的历史数据源、数据完整性因缺乏严格质量保证而受损、任务设定脱离真实世界场景、分析视角僵化导致难以获得可泛化的模型能力洞察。

Conclusion: TIME通过严格的零样本评估设置、真实世界对齐的任务配置以及创新的模式级分析视角，为时间序列基础模型评估建立了新标准，促进了对模型能力的更深入理解。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are revolutionizing the forecasting landscape from specific dataset modeling to generalizable task evaluation. However, we contend that existing benchmarks exhibit common limitations in four dimensions: constrained data composition dominated by reused legacy sources, compromised data integrity lacking rigorous quality assurance, misaligned task formulations detached from real-world contexts, and rigid analysis perspectives that obscure generalizable insights. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TIME, a next-generation task-centric benchmark comprising 50 fresh datasets and 98 forecasting tasks, tailored for strict zero-shot TSFM evaluation free from data leakage. Integrating large language models and human expertise, we establish a rigorous human-in-the-loop benchmark construction pipeline to ensure high data integrity and redefine task formulation by aligning forecasting configurations with real-world operational requirements and variate predictability. Furthermore, we propose a novel pattern-level evaluation perspective that moves beyond traditional dataset-level evaluations based on static meta labels. By leveraging structural time series features to characterize intrinsic temporal properties, this approach offers generalizable insights into model capabilities across diverse patterns. We evaluate 12 representative TSFMs and establish a multi-granular leaderboard to facilitate in-depth analysis and visualized inspection. The leaderboard is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/Real-TSF/TIME-leaderboard.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了联合嵌入预测架构(JEPAs)与准度量强化学习(QRL)的内在联系：在闭包性和可加性假设下，JEPAs的固有能量函数(轨迹累积努力的最小值)天然构成准度量；而目标到达控制中的最优代价函数恰好具有这种固有能量形式，从而建立了表示学习与目标条件控制的理论桥梁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对称能量函数在单向可达性问题中的结构失配问题，探索JEPAs与QRL在目标条件控制中的深层理论关联。

Method: 通过数学约束分析：1) 限定JEPAs使用固有能量函数(轨迹累积努力的下确界)；2) 证明在闭包性和可加性假设下，此类能量函数满足准度量性质；3) 论证最优代价函数与固有能量的等价性。

Result: 1) 固有能量函数必然构成准度量；2) 目标到达控制的最优代价函数精确对应固有能量形式；3) JEPAs建模固有能量时即属于QRL的目标值函数类；4) 揭示对称能量与方向性问题的根本冲突。

Conclusion: 建立了JEPAs表示学习与QRL目标条件控制的理论统一框架：固有能量作为核心纽带，既解释了QRL采用非对称准度量的必要性，也为JEPAs在方向敏感任务中的应用提供新范式。

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) aim to learn representations by predicting target embeddings from context embeddings, inducing a scalar compatibility energy in a latent space. In contrast, Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning (QRL) studies goal-conditioned control through directed distance values (cost-to-go) that support reaching goals under asymmetric dynamics. In this short article, we connect these viewpoints by restricting attention to a principled class of JEPA energy functions : intrinsic (least-action) energies, defined as infima of accumulated local effort over admissible trajectories between two states. Under mild closure and additivity assumptions, any intrinsic energy is a quasimetric. In goal-reaching control, optimal cost-to-go functions admit exactly this intrinsic form ; inversely, JEPAs trained to model intrinsic energies lie in the quasimetric value class targeted by QRL. Moreover, we observe why symmetric finite energies are structurally mismatched with one-way reachability, motivating asymmetric (quasimetric) energies when directionality matters.

Conclusion: SafeNeuron为模型对齐提供了可解释且鲁棒的解决方案，通过神经元级干预实现更安全的AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs are typically safety-aligned before release to prevent harmful content generation. However, recent studies show that safety behaviors are concentrated in a small subset of parameters, making alignment brittle and easily bypassed through neuron-level attacks. Moreover, most existing alignment methods operate at the behavioral level, offering limited control over the model's internal safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SafeNeuron, a neuron-level safety alignment framework that improves robustness by redistributing safety representations across the network. SafeNeuron first identifies safety-related neurons, then freezes these neurons during preference optimization to prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways and force the model to construct redundant safety representations. Extensive experiments across models and modalities demonstrate that SafeNeuron significantly improves robustness against neuron pruning attacks, reduces the risk of open-source models being repurposed as red-team generators, and preserves general capabilities. Furthermore, our layer-wise analysis reveals that safety behaviors are governed by stable and shared internal representations. Overall, SafeNeuron provides an interpretable and robust perspective for model alignment.

Conclusion: 通过GRPO奖励归一化解决起始结构异质性方差问题，使模型化分子优化方法具备高效泛化能力

Abstract: Molecular design encompasses tasks ranging from de-novo design to structural alteration of given molecules or fragments. For the latter, state-of-the-art methods predominantly function as "Instance Optimizers'', expending significant compute restarting the search for every input structure. While model-based approaches theoretically offer amortized efficiency by learning a policy transferable to unseen structures, existing methods struggle to generalize. We identify a key failure mode: the high variance arising from the heterogeneous difficulty of distinct starting structures. To address this, we introduce GRXForm, adapting a pre-trained Graph Transformer model that optimizes molecules via sequential atom-and-bond additions. We employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for goal-directed fine-tuning to mitigate variance by normalizing rewards relative to the starting structure. Empirically, GRXForm generalizes to out-of-distribution molecular scaffolds without inference-time oracle calls or refinement, achieving scores in multi-objective optimization competitive with leading instance optimizers.

Conclusion: 该理论分析揭示了偏好对齐方法中先前未被表征的基本现象，为设计更稳定有效的对齐算法提供了实践指导，并在真实世界偏好数据上验证了发现。

Abstract: Standard methods for aligning large language models with human preferences learn from pairwise comparisons among sampled candidate responses and regularize toward a reference policy. Despite their effectiveness, the effects of sampling and reference choices are poorly understood theoretically. We investigate these effects through Identity Preference Optimization, a widely used preference alignment framework, and show that proper instance-dependent sampling can yield stronger ranking guarantees, while skewed on-policy sampling can induce excessive concentration under structured preferences. We then analyze iterative alignment dynamics in which the learned policy feeds back into future sampling and reference policies, reflecting a common practice of model-generated preference data. We prove that these dynamics can exhibit persistent oscillations or entropy collapse for certain parameter choices, and characterize regimes that guarantee stability. Our theoretical insights extend to Direct Preference Optimization, indicating the phenomena we captured are common to a broader class of preference-alignment methods. Experiments on real-world preference data validate our findings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical signal classification faces challenges with long sequences, complex temporal dynamics, and multi-scale frequency patterns that standard transformers cannot adequately capture.

Method: WaveFormer integrates wavelet decomposition in two stages: (1) multi-channel DWT for embedding construction to create time-frequency tokens, and (2) Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE) using mono-channel DWT for adaptive positional embeddings.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on eight diverse datasets covering human activity recognition and brain signal analysis, with sequence lengths from 50 to 3000 timesteps and channel counts from 1 to 144.

Conclusion: Provides a principled framework for incorporating frequency-domain knowledge into transformer-based time series classification.

Abstract: Biomedical signal classification presents unique challenges due to long sequences, complex temporal dynamics, and multi-scale frequency patterns that are poorly captured by standard transformer architectures. We propose WaveFormer, a transformer architecture that integrates wavelet decomposition at two critical stages: embedding construction, where multi-channel Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) extracts frequency features to create tokens containing both time-domain and frequency-domain information, and positional encoding, where Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE) adapts position embeddings to signal-specific temporal structure through mono-channel DWT analysis. We evaluate WaveFormer on eight diverse datasets spanning human activity recognition and brain signal analysis, with sequence lengths ranging from 50 to 3000 timesteps and channel counts from 1 to 144. Experimental results demonstrate that WaveFormer achieves competitive performance through comprehensive frequency-aware processing. Our approach provides a principled framework for incorporating frequency-domain knowledge into transformer-based time series classification.

Result: 理论证明：任何静态路由方案对频率为f的重复模式都需要Ω(f·n)注意力。在SRCD基准上：1.6%注意力计算达到100%检索准确率（基线为68%）。注意力利用率在3K步时急剧下降，实现37.8倍降低。巩固模式可迁移到未见任务，无需重训练即可减少48-52%注意力。学习到的巩固动态与人类记忆转换曲线定量匹配（γ=0.43 vs. 人类γ≈0.4-0.5）。

Conclusion: CRAM通过记忆巩固机制成功实现了注意力利用率的动态递减，显著提升了效率，其学习到的动态过程与人类认知心理学发现高度一致，为高效混合架构提供了新方向。

Abstract: Hybrid architectures combining state-space models with attention have achieved strong efficiency-quality tradeoffs, yet existing approaches either apply attention uniformly or learn static sparse patterns. This misses a key opportunity: \emph{attention demand should decrease over time as recurring patterns become familiar}. We present a surprising finding from analyzing GPT-2 models: \textbf{88\%} of attention operations retrieve information already predictable from the model's hidden state, and this redundancy does \emph{not} decrease during training. Motivated by this observation, we introduce \textbf{\ours{}} (\textbf{C}onsolidation-based \textbf{R}outing for \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{M}emory), a biologically inspired memory consolidation mechanism that gradually distills episodic retrievals into parametric semantic memory. Unlike prior sparse attention methods, \ours{} exhibits \emph{decreasing attention utilization} over training, achieving a \textbf{37.8$\times$} reduction through a sharp phase transition at approximately 3K steps. We prove that this capability is \emph{impossible} without consolidation: any static routing scheme requires $Ω(f \cdot n)$ attention for tasks with recurring patterns of frequency $f$. On our proposed SRCD benchmark, \ours{} achieves \textbf{100\% retrieval accuracy} at 1.6\% attention compute (vs.\ 68\% for baselines), and consolidated patterns transfer to unseen tasks with \textbf{48--52\%} attention reduction without retraining. Remarkably, the learned consolidation dynamics quantitatively match human episodic-to-semantic memory transition curves from cognitive psychology ($γ= 0.43$ vs.\ $γ_{\text{human}} \approx 0.4$--$0.5$).

Motivation: 现有扩散和流模型趋向于加速推理，但类别数据的离散特性阻碍了蒸馏技术的应用，亟需一种能实现高效少步生成的连续化建模方法。

Method: 构建指向概率单形的流映射，连续传输概率质量至预测终点；利用自蒸馏和端点一致性目标进行训练；连续轨迹天然支持测试时的引导与重加权技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为类别数据提供了统一的连续建模范式，显著提升生成效率，并通过兼容现有引导技术增强了可控性，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: We introduce Categorical Flow Maps, a flow-matching method for accelerated few-step generation of categorical data via self-distillation. Building on recent variational formulations of flow matching and the broader trend towards accelerated inference in diffusion and flow-based models, we define a flow map towards the simplex that transports probability mass toward a predicted endpoint, yielding a parametrisation that naturally constrains model predictions. Since our trajectories are continuous rather than discrete, Categorical Flow Maps can be trained with existing distillation techniques, as well as a new objective based on endpoint consistency. This continuous formulation also automatically unlocks test-time inference: we can directly reuse existing guidance and reweighting techniques in the categorical setting to steer sampling toward downstream objectives. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art few-step results on images, molecular graphs, and text, with strong performance even in single-step generation.

### [120] [Self-Supervised Learning via Flow-Guided Neural Operator on Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12267)
*Duy Nguyen,Jiachen Yao,Jiayun Wang,Julius Berner,Animashree Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel self-supervised learning framework for time-series data that treats corruption level as a learnable parameter instead of using fixed masking ratios. It combines operator learning with flow matching to extract hierarchical features from multiple noise levels, enabling robust representations that outperform baselines across biomedical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders rely on static, predetermined masking ratios for time-series data. The authors argue that treating corruption level as a new degree of freedom could enhance flexibility and representation learning performance.

Method: The Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO) combines operator learning with flow matching. It uses Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify time resolutions and extracts hierarchical features from different network layers and flow times that apply varying noise strengths. Unlike prior methods, it uses clean inputs during inference while learning with noise.

Result: FGNO achieves up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes, consistently outperforming baselines across three biomedical domains.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates robustness to data scarcity and superior capacity to learn expressive, versatile representations for diverse time-series tasks, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single adaptable model.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful paradigm for learning from unlabeled time-series data. However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes. These results highlight FGNO's robustness to data scarcity and its superior capacity to learn expressive representations for diverse time series.

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Bell states and quantum teleportation play important roles in the study of quantum information and computation. But a comprehensive theoretical research on both of them remains to be performed. This work aims to investigate important algebraic properties of generalized Bell states as well as explore topological features of quantum teleportation. First, the basis theorem and basis group are introduced to explain that the extension of a generalized Bell basis by a unitary matrix is still an orthonormal basis. Then a twist operator is defined to make a connection between a generalized multiple qubit Bell state and a tensor product of two qubit Bell state. Besides them, the Temperley--Lieb algebra, the braid group relation and the Yang--Baxter equation are used to provide a topological diagrammatic description of generalized Bell states and quantum teleportation. It turns out that our approach is able to present a clear illustration of relevant quantum information protocols and exhibit a topological nature of quantum entanglement and quantum teleportation.

*Joshua W. Dai,Bálint Koczor*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种分层抽样框架来降低准概率分解(QPDs)的方差，在无需额外量子资源的情况下可将采样成本降低60-80%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准概率分解(QPDs)虽对量子算法至关重要，但会引入超出玻恩规则散粒噪声的配置方差，增加采样成本，需要有效方法降低该方差

Method: 开发基于理想比例分配的分层抽样框架，并设计经典动态规划算法实现对任意乘积形式QPDs的自动化分层

Result: 理论上证明该方法提供无偏估计且方差从不劣于朴素采样；在PEC和PAI等典型QPDs的数值模拟中，oracle模型下实现60-80%方差缩减，单次采样场景下稳健节省约10%

Conclusion: 该技术可直接应用于近中期含噪声及早期容错量子算法中的实用QPDs，在不增加量子资源的前提下显著降低总体采样成本

Abstract: Quasi-probability decompositions (QPDs) have proven essential in many quantum algorithms and protocols -- one replaces a ``difficult'' quantum circuit with an ensemble of ``easier'' circuit variants whose weighted outcomes reproduce any target observable. This, however, inevitably yields an increased configuration variance beyond Born-rule shot noise. We develop a broad framework for accounting for and reducing this variance and prove that stratified sampling -- under ideal proportional allocation -- results in an unbiased estimator with a variance that is never worse than naïve sampling (with equality only in degenerate cases).
  Furthermore, we provide a classical dynamic programme to enable stratification on arbitrary product-form QPDs. Numerical simulations of typical QPDs, such as Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) and Probabilistic Angle Interpolation (PAI), demonstrate constant-factor reductions in overall variance (up to $\sim 60$--$80\%$ in an oracle model) and robust $\sim 10\%$ savings in the pessimistic single-shot regime. Our results can be applied immediately to reduce the net sampling cost of practically relevant QPDs that are commonly used in near term and early fault-tolerant algorithms without requiring additional quantum resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基塔耶夫的拓扑量子计算方案需要零温基态，而现代量子硬件本质上是含噪声的，需要主动纠错而非被动维持基态；现有研究尚未充分解决如何在噪声环境下通过编织任意子实现通用量子计算的问题。

Conclusion: 该纠错方案使得拓扑量子计算可以利用现代含噪声量子硬件实现容错计算，为开发实用化量子计算机提供了新路径。

Abstract: In seminal work (arxiv:quant-ph/9707021) Alexei Kitaev proposed topological quantum computing (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:quant-ph/0001108, arXiv:0707.1889), whereby logic gates of a quantum computer are conducted by creating, braiding and fusing anyonic particles on a two-dimensional plane. Furthermore, he showed the proposal is inherently robust to local perturbations (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:1001.0344, arXiv:1001.4363) when anyons are created as quasiparticle excitations of a topologically ordered lattice model prepared at zero temperature. Over the decades following this proposal there have been considerable technological developments towards the construction of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Rather than maintaining some target ground state at zero temperature, a modern approach is to actively correct the errors a target state experiences, where we use noisy quantum circuit elements to identify and subsequently correct for deviations from the ideal state. We present an error-correction scheme that enables us to carry out robust universal quantum computation by braiding anyons. We show that our scheme can be carried out on a suitably large device with an arbitrarily small failure rate assuming circuit elements are below some threshold level of local noise. The error-corrected scheme we have developed therefore enables us to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using modern quantum hardware that is now under development.

*Joseph T. Iosue,Paraj Titum,Taohan Lin,Clare Lau,Leigh M. Norris*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper uses quantum control theory and filter function formalism to derive general conditions for achieving superresolution in quantum sensing, developing an optimal control framework to discover protocols that surpass conventional resolution limits even with experimental constraints, and evaluating the advantage of entangled initial states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resolving closely spaced frequencies is critical for communications, spectroscopy, and sensing applications. While quantum sensing protocols can achieve superresolution (discriminating arbitrarily small frequency separations), a general theoretical framework from quantum control perspective is needed to systematically design such protocols.

Method: The authors employ the filter function formalism from quantum control theory to derive analytic conditions for superresolution. They develop an optimal control framework and use numerical optimization to identify viable superresolution protocols under realistic experimental constraints.

Result: The work provides a systematic path to discover novel quantum sensing protocols that surpass conventional resolution limits. The framework also extends to entangled initial states, assessing their potential advantages in achieving superresolution.

Conclusion: This quantum control-based approach is broadly applicable to diverse quantum sensing platforms, offering a principled method to discover new protocols that break conventional resolution limits.

Abstract: Resolving signals with closely spaced frequencies is central to applications in communications, spectroscopy and sensing. Recent results have shown that quantum sensing protocols can exhibit superresolution, the ability to discriminate between spectral lines with arbitrarily small frequency separation. Here, we revisit this problem from the perspective of quantum control theory, utilizing the filter function formalism to derive general, analytic conditions on quantum control protocols for achieving superresolution. Building on these conditions, we develop an optimal control framework, the utility of which is demonstrated through numerical identification of superresolution control protocols in the presence of realistic, experimentally-relevant constraints. We further extend our results to entangled initial states and assess their potential advantage. Our approach is broadly applicable to a wide variety of quantum sensing platforms, and it provides a systematic path to discover novel protocols that surpass conventional resolution limits in these systems.

*Malaquias Correa Anguita,Sara Marzban,William F. Braasch,Twesh Upadhyaya,Gabriel Landi,Nicole Yunger Halpern,Jelmer J. Renema*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper experimentally demonstrates that Maxwell's demon can create larger temperature differences when working with indistinguishable photons (Bose-Einstein statistics) compared to distinguishable particles, validating a long-standing theoretical prediction about quantum statistics affecting thermodynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To experimentally test the decade-and-a-half-old theoretical prediction that Maxwell's demon can evolve a system farther from equilibrium (creating greater thermodynamic resources) when particles obey Bose-Einstein statistics rather than being distinguishable.

Method: Using a fully programmable linear-optics platform where photon statistics behave thermally. The demon performs nondestructive measurement of photon numbers in a subset of modes, then conditionally interchanges measured and unmeasured modes based on the outcome, creating a temperature difference.

Result: The created temperature difference between modes is greater on average when photons are indistinguishable compared to when they are distinguishable, directly supporting the theoretical prediction about quantum statistics enhancing the demon's thermodynamic capabilities.

Conclusion: This result validates a fundamental prediction about the interplay among thermodynamics, information, and quantum particle statistics. Additionally, it suggests a thermodynamic method for weakly validating boson-sampling platforms.

Abstract: Maxwell's demon elucidates the value of information in thermodynamics, using measurement and feedback: he evolves an equilibrated gas into a nonequilibrium state, from which one might extract work. The demon can evolve the system farther from equilibrium, on average, if the particles obey Bose-Einstein statistics than if they are distinguishable. We experimentally support this decade-and-a-half-old prediction by comparing indistinguishable with distinguishable photons. We use a fully programmable linear-optics platform, whose local photon statistics were shown recently to behave thermally. Our demon nondestructively measures the number of photons in a subset of the modes. Guided by the outcome, he conditionally interchanges the measured and unmeasured modes. This interchange creates a positive temperature difference between a mode in a particular subset and a mode in the other. The temperature difference is greater, on average, if the photons are indistinguishable. This result bolsters a long-standing prediction about the interplay among thermodynamics, information, and quantum particle statistics. Additionally, this work suggests a thermodynamic means of weakly validating boson-sampling platforms.

*Rishabh Jha,Heiko Georg Menzler*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文发现，长程Kitaev链中局域边界算符产生的Lanczos系数可通过" Krylov交错参数"（相邻奇偶Lanczos系数的对数比）有效区分拓扑超导体的边界局域化与体扩展低能激发，并开发了精确算法实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Krylov子空间方法被提出用于区分量子混沌与可积性，但二次费米子哈密顿量的Lanczos结构通常被认为是平凡的。该研究旨在探究在长程Kitaev链模型中，Lanczos系数能否作为低能激发局域化性质的定量诊断工具，特别是在边界与体激发竞争的情况下。

Method: 通过分析代数衰减耦合的长程Kitaev链，从局域边界算符生成Lanczos系数，并定义Krylov交错参数为相邻奇偶系数之比的对数。提出精确的单粒子算符Lanczos算法，将指数级算符空间约化到有限维线性问题。

Result: Krylov交错参数的符号结构在全相图中与能隙的边界/体特性表现出强相关性。这种相关性源于配对、幂律耦合和开放边界诱导的双分Krylov结构。算法可对数百个位点的链实现机器精度计算。

Conclusion: Krylov诊断成为探测低能激发沿链局域化程度及与破缺U(1)对称性边界关联强度的有效探针，在离子阱和冷原子量子模拟器中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Krylov subspace methods quantify operator growth in quantum many-body systems through Lanczos coefficients that encode how operators spread under time evolution. While these diagnostics have been proposed to distinguish quantum chaos from integrability, quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians are widely expected to exhibit trivial Lanczos structure. Here we demonstrate that Lanczos coefficients generated from local boundary operators provide a quantitative diagnostic of whether the lowest excitation gap is controlled by boundary-localized or bulk-extended modes in the long-range Kitaev chain, the model for topological superconductivity with algebraically decaying couplings. We introduce \emph{Krylov staggering parameter}, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites. These results establish Krylov diagnostics as operational probes of how low-energy excitations are localized along the chain and how strongly they are tied to the boundaries with broken U(1) symmetry, with potential applications to trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum simulators.

Motivation: 传统量子非互易器件依赖手性波导或外磁场，不利于集成量子光学应用。亟需在常规非手性系统中实现可控的非互易性，以开发新型量子器件。

Method: 采用全量子主方程结合输入-输出理论，研究两个二能级系统在相干场驱动下与一维波导耦合的量子动力学行为，通过工程设计Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya相互作用实现非互易调控。

Result: DMI可在原本互易系统中诱导强非互易性，其行为可通过驱动强度、失谐和DMI相位灵活调控；系统可演化至纯态实现功率无关的完美透明，条件取决于传播相位、相对失谐和交换相互作用；纯态点处纠缠具有互易性和闭式解，偏离时产生非互易纠缠；DMI重塑光子统计，将超聚束从透射（无DMI）转移到反射（有限DMI）。

Conclusion: DMI为波导QED系统提供了工程化非互易性、透明性、纠缠和光子关联的多功能资源，无需手性波导即可实现量子隔离器、路由器和超聚束光源，推动了集成量子光学器件的发展。

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of quantum nonreciprocity induced via a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in an otherwise achiral, waveguide quantum electrodynamics. Using the full quantum master equation and input-output formalism for two-level systems coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide and driven by a coherent field, we show that an engineered DMI enables strong nonreciprocity in an otherwise reciprocal system, with tunable behavior governed by driving strength, detunings, and phase of the DMI. Using it not only demonstrates nonreciprocal transmission but also demonstrates nonreciprocal quantum entanglement and photon bunching. The system can end up in a pure state as certain decohering channels do not participate. The pure state leads to power-independent perfect transparency. Conditions are derived and depend on the propagation phase, the relative detuning of the two qubits, and the exchange interaction. At these pure-state points, the steady-state entanglement is reciprocal and admits a closed-form expression; away from them, phase control generates strong entanglement nonreciprocity. The DMI also reshapes photon statistics, redistributing two-photon correlations and shifting superbunching from transmission (no DMI) to reflection at finite DMI. These results establish DMI as a versatile resource for engineering nonreciprocity, transparency, entanglement, and photon correlations in waveguide QED, enabling isolators, routers, and superbunching light sources without requiring chiral waveguides.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种全量子Metropolis-Hastings算法求解整数线性规划问题，通过可逆量子电路实现相干随机游走，无需量子RAM或经典预处理，资源开销线性增长，为量子约束编程提供基线方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整数线性规划（ILP）在调度、物流和设计优化中至关重要，但其NP完全性质导致计算挑战巨大，经典算法难以高效求解大规模实例，亟需探索量子计算加速的可能性。

Method: 设计全量子Metropolis-Hastings算法：1) 在离散可行域实现相干随机游走；2) 仅用可逆量子电路，无需量子RAM；3) 每步为幺正更新，包含相干候选移动准备、目标函数与约束的可逆评估、约束计数器及低开销线性化Metropolis接受幅度编码；4) 使用O(n log₂ N)量子比特表示n个[-N,N-1]区间整数变量；5) 采用纹波进位加法器支持线性目标和混合等式/不等式约束。

Result: 资源复杂度：Toffoli等价代价与逻辑量子比特数呈线性增长；数值模拟验证：在随机实例上观测到预测的线性资源扩展；热化行为：退火调度下算法逐步收敛至低成本可行解。

Conclusion: 该方法为全量子约束编程提供了资源明确、相干性保障的基线方案，并为未来整合更多量子加速技术解决组合优化问题奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: Integer linear programming (ILP) remains computationally challenging due to its NP-complete nature despite its central role in scheduling, logistics, and design optimization. We introduce a fully quantum Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for ILP that implements a coherent random walk over the discrete feasible region using only reversible quantum circuits, without quantum-RAM assumptions or classical pre/post-processing. Each walk step is a unitary update that prepares coherent candidate moves, evaluates the objective and constraints reversibly -- including a constraint-satisfaction counter to enforce feasibility -- and encodes Metropolis acceptance amplitudes via a low-overhead linearized rule. At the logical level, the construction uses $\mathcal{O}(n\log_2 N)$ qubits to represent $n$ integer variables over the interval $[-N,\,N-1]$, and the Toffoli-equivalent cost per Metropolis step grows linearly with the total logical qubit count. Using explicit ripple-carry adder constructions, we support linear objectives and mixed equality/inequality constraints. Numerical circuit-level simulations on a broad ensemble of randomly generated instances validate the predicted linear resource scaling and exhibit progressive thermalization toward low-cost feasible solutions under the annealing schedule. Overall, the method provides a coherent, resource-characterized baseline for fully quantum constraint programming and a foundation for incorporating additional quantum speedups in combinatorial optimization.

### [129] [The necessary and sufficient condition for perfect teleportation and superdense coding and all the suitable states for teleportation and superdense coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11293)
*Dafa Li*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文研究了量子信息任务中协议的LU不变性，证明了Agrawal-Pati提出的完美隐形传态(PTP)和2比特超密编码(PSDC-2)是LU不变的，而3比特超密编码(PSDC-3)和Nielsen隐形传态不是。给出状态适用于PTP、PSDC-2和PSDC-3的充要条件，并由此得出PTP和PSDC-2仅需要1 ebit的共享纠缠，且所有真正的纠缠态和可分态中满足该条件的状态均被列出；同时证明W类SLOCC态均不适用于PSDC-3。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在量子信息理论中，两个局部幺正(LU)等价的状态具有相同的纠缠量并能完成相同的任务。若一个协议对任意LU等价的状态要么都适用、要么都不适用，则称该协议为LU不变。此前尚未有研究探讨具体量子协议是否具备LU不变性。Agrawal和Pati在2006年提出了完美隐形传态(PTP)和两类超密编码(PSDC-2、PSDC-3)。本文旨在检验这些协议的LU不变性，并刻画适用状态的特征。

Method: 通过分析状态在局部幺正变换下的等价类，结合纠缠度量（ebits）和SLOCC分类，给出PTP、PSDC-2和PSDC-3的适用条件的充要条件；利用LU不变性推导出PTP和PSDC-2仅需要1 ebit的共享纠缠，进而列出所有满足该条件的真纠缠态和可分态；进一步检验W类SLOCC状态对PSDC-3的适用性。

Result: 1. PTP和PSDC-2是LU不变的；2. PSDC-3不是LU不变的；3. Nielsen提出的隐形传态协议也不是LU不变的；4. 状态适用于PTP或PSDC-2当且仅当它具有1 ebit的共享纠缠；5. 列出了所有适用于PTP和PSDC-2的真纠缠态和可分态；6. 任何属于W类SLOCC的状态均不适用于PSDC-3。

Conclusion: LU不变性是某些量子协议（如PTP、PSDC-2）的固有属性，但并非所有协议都具备。对于PTP和PSDC-2，1 ebit的纠缠是必要且充分的条件，这揭示了它们不要求真纠缠。相反，PSDC-3对状态的要求更为严格，且W类态完全不适合。此研究为协议设计与状态选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: It is known that two local unitaries (LU) equivalent states possess the same amount of entanglement and can be used to perform the same tasks in quantum information theory (QIT). For a protocol for a task in QIT, we call a protocol LU invariant if two LU-equivalent states are either both suitable for the protocol or neither is. So far, no one has discussed whether a protocol for a task in QIT is LU invariant. In [Phys. Rev. A, 74, 062320 (2006)], Agrawal and Pati proposed the perfect teleportation protocol (PTP) and the protocol for superdense coding to transmit 2-bit classical information by sending one qubit (PSDC-2) and 3-bit classical information by sending two qubits (PSDC-3). In this paper, we show that PTP and PSDC-2 are LU invariant. That is, two LU equivalent states are suitable for PTP and PSDC-2 or neither of them is. We show that PSDC-3 is not LU invariant. We also indicate that the teleportation proposed in <cite>Nielsen</cite> is not LU invariant. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a state to be suitable for PTP, PSDC-2, and PSDC-3, respectively. Via the LU invariance of PTP and PSDC-2, we prove that a state is suitable for PTP and PSDC-2 if and only if it has 1 ebit of shared entanglement, respectively and find all genuine entangled states and separable states which are suitable for PTP and PSDC-2, respectively. So far, no one has indicated that PTP and PSDC-2 do not require genuine entanglement. Agrawal and Pati suggested to study if there are subclasses of W SLOCC class which are suitable for PSDC-3. So far, it still remains an unsolved question. We show that any state of the SLOCC class W is not suitable for PSDC-3.

*G. Bacciagaluppi,R. Hermens,G. Leegwater*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文揭示贝尔不等式推导中的测量独立性假设与信号传递之间的深刻联系，证明通过施加无信号约束可以建立不依赖测量独立性的贝尔定理版本，并以舒尔曼模型为例探讨其对实验形而上学的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准贝尔定理依赖测量独立性假设（隐变量分布与测量设置独立），但该假设难以直接检验。研究者希望找到更可靠的约束条件来强化贝尔检验的理论基础。

Method: 通过理论分析将测量独立性违反与原理性信号传递关联，阐明其成立条件；在无信号约束下重新证明贝尔定理；以舒尔曼模型作为具体案例研究。

Result: 发现某些测量独立性违反会在原理上允许超光速信号传递，从而可被实验检验；成功推导出无需测量独立性假设的贝尔定理版本；舒尔曼模型展示了回溯因果性如何在不传递信号的前提下违反测量独立性。

Conclusion: 该工作用更具物理意义的无信号约束替代难以验证的测量独立性假设，为贝尔实验提供了更坚实的理论框架，对量子基础领域的实验研究具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Besides well-known conditions of locality or factorisability, deriving the Bell inequalities requires assuming that the distribution of hidden variables and Alice's and Bob's measurement settings be independent of each other. We show that (analogously to violations of locality due to action at a distance) certain violations of this Measurement Independence assumption can be associated with a notion of signalling in principle, thus making them also testable in principle, and spell out the appropriate conditions. Accordingly, we show that by imposing no-signalling one can prove a version of Bell's theorem that does not require the assumption of Measurement Independence. We discuss the "Schulman model" as an example, as well as lessons for "experimental metaphysics".

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Equilibrium statistical ensembles commute with the Hamiltonian and thus carry no coherence in the energy eigenbasis. We develop a thermodynamic framework in which energy fluctuations can retain genuinely quantum-coherent contributions. We foliate state space into "minimum-variance leaves," defined by minimizing the average energy variance over all pure-state decompositions, with the minimum set by the quantum Fisher information. On each leaf we construct the least-biased state compatible with normalization and mean energy, defining a leaf-canonical ensemble. The Gibbs ensemble is recovered on the distinguished commuting leaf, while generic states are organized by their leaf label. This structure provides a natural setting to extend eigenstate thermalization beyond equilibrium via a "leaf typicality" hypothesis. According to that hypothesis, under unitary time evolution local observables depend only on the leaf and energy and, at all times, are reproduced by evolving a representative (pure) state drawn from the optimal ensemble.

Conclusion: 该框架简化了多离子纠缠操作复杂度，实现了高速高保真度量子门，为大规模离子阱量子计算提供新路径

Abstract: Entangling interactions between distant qubits can be mediated via an additional degree of freedom. In conventional trapped-ion schemes, realizing a well-defined, coherent gate typically requires spectrally addressing a specific bus mode. As the ion number increases, the coupling to each individual motional mode becomes weaker, so gates on large ion strings mediated by a single mode are necessarily slow. Moreover, addressing a large number of modes demands complex driving schemes, and the fundamentally perturbative character of these approaches imposes constraints on achievable gate speed and fidelity.
  Here, we introduce a scheme for entangling trapped-ion qubits using a time-dependent magnetic-field gradient, in which all axial motional modes participate in mediating the interaction and the gate construction is nonperturbative. The framework can be used to implement both multi-qubit gates and two-qubit gates between arbitrary pairs in a linear ion string. Through several explicit examples, we highlight the advantages over existing magnetic-gradient schemes and show how gates on multiple ion pairs can be carried out simultaneously.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This review paper analyzes adaptations of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for NISQ-era quantum computers, focusing on three main areas: VQE variants for circuit complexity reduction/chemistry-inspired ansatzes/excited-state extensions, benchmarking accuracy, and current quantum simulator capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of near-term quantum hardware (e.g., qubit decoherence, limited qubit counts) by reviewing hybrid quantum-classical VQE adaptations that reduce computational workload compared to fully quantum algorithms like QPE.

Method: Systematic review of three VQE flavor categories: (1) circuit complexity reduction techniques, (2) chemistry-inspired ansatz designs, (3) excited-state extensions; plus analysis of benchmarking standards and quantum simulator advancements.

Result: Identifies key VQE adaptations mitigating NISQ constraints, synthesizes accuracy benchmarks across methods, and documents the current landscape of quantum simulators for validation.

Conclusion: VQE variants show promise for practical NISQ-era Hamiltonian eigenvalue calculations, but require continued co-development of ansatz design, benchmarking protocols, and simulator tools to enhance scalability and reliability.

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has been developed to target near term Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers as a method to find the eigenvalues of Hamiltonians. Unlike fully quantum algorithms such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), VQE based methods are hybrid algorithms that utilize both quantum and classical hardware to combat issues with the near term quantum hardware such as small numbers of available qubits and the decoherence of qubits. Different adaptations (flavors) of VQE have been implemented to combat these scalability issues on NISQ devices compared to standard VQE. These different flavors are modifications of the underlying VQE ansatz to reduce the computational workload on the quantum hardware. In this review we focus on 3 main areas related to VQE. The first focus is on flavors of VQE that fall under the categories of circuit complexity reduction, chemistry inspired ansatz, and extensions of VQE to excited states. The remaining portion of the review focuses on benchmarking the accuracy of VQE methods and an overview of the current state of quantum simulators.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive quantum mechanical analysis of the exotic Landau model in a two-dimensional noncommutative plane, focusing on constructing and validating novel coherent states (including quaternionic vector types) and deriving key physical properties like propagators and uncertainty relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of the Landau model into noncommutative quantum mechanics by rigorously developing and analyzing coherent states and their associated physical phenomena within this exotic framework.

Method: Begins with classical formulation to derive conserved quantities, then quantizes to construct oscillator representations and bosonic Fock spaces. Explicitly constructs coherent states, verifies them against Klauder's criteria, and develops matrix/quaternionic vector coherent states. Uses path integrals for propagator calculations.

Result: Successfully constructs coherent states satisfying all Klauder's criteria (normalization, continuity, resolution of identity, temporal stability, action identity). Develops novel matrix and quaternionic vector coherent states. Provides detailed calculations of the free particle propagator, uncertainty relations, and time evolution of probability densities.

Conclusion: The study rigorously establishes a complete quantum mechanical framework for the exotic Landau model in noncommutative space, demonstrating the physical viability of the constructed coherent states and advancing the mathematical structure of noncommutative quantum systems through quaternionic extensions.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study of the exotic Landau model in a two-dimensional noncommutative plane. Beginning with the classical formulation where two conserved quantities $\mathcal{P}_i$ and $\mathcal{K}_i$ are derived, we proceed to the quantum level where these lead to two independent oscillator representations generating bosonic Fock spaces $Γ_{\mathcal{P}}$ and $Γ_{\mathcal{K}}$. Coherent states satisfying all Klauder's criteria are explicitly constructed, and their physical properties including normalization, continuity, resolution of the identity, temporal stability, and action identity are rigorously proven. We further develop matrix vector coherent states and quaternionic vector coherent states, examining their mathematical structure and physical implications. Detailed calculations of the free particle propagator via path integrals, uncertainty relations, and time evolution of probability densities are provided.

Abstract: Integrated photonics provides a powerful approach for developing compact, stable and scalable architectures for the generation, manipulation and detection of quantum states of light. To this end, several material platforms are being developed in parallel, each providing its specific assets, and hybridization techniques to combine their strengths are now possible. This review focuses on AlGaAs, a III-V semiconductor platform combining a mature fabrication technology, direct band-gap compliant with electrical injection, low-loss operation, large electro-optic effect, and compatibility with superconducting detectors for on-chip detection. We detail recent implementations of room-temperature sources of quantum light based on the high second- and third-order optical nonlinearities of the material, as well as photonic circuits embedding various functionalities ranging from polarizing beamsplitters to Mach-Zehnder interferometers, modulators and tunable filters. We then present several realizations of quantum state engineering enabled by these recent advances and discuss open perspectives and remaining challenges in the field of integrated quantum photonics with AlGaAs.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文通过测量和反馈对横向Clifford门进行"规范固定"，提出了两种将qLDPC码转化为非阿贝尔码的构造方法，实现了在非阿贝尔拓扑序下进行魔法态制备和非Clifford门操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子计算需要非Clifford门实现通用性，但qLDPC码多为阿贝尔性质。非阿贝尔拓扑序在魔法态制备中具有优势，如何将高效qLDPC码扩展为非阿贝尔版本是亟待解决的关键问题。

Method: 第一种方法针对具有广义Poincaré对偶性的qLDPC码，通过规范固定直接构造稳定子类似Type-III扭曲量子双模型的非阿贝尔码。第二种通用方法使用可定制的辅助量子比特图结构，对任意qLDPC码进行单横向门的规范固定。两种方法均依赖测量与反馈技术。

Result: 成功构造出两类非阿贝尔qLDPC码，均展现出2D非阿贝尔拓扑序特征（如环面单任意子模拟）。证明了规范固定后的编码可通过测量逻辑Clifford门实现魔法态制备，从而在任意qLDPC码上执行非Clifford操作。

Conclusion: 该规范固定方案为基于qLDPC码的通用量子计算提供了可行协议，建立了阿贝尔量子纠错与非阿贝尔拓扑计算间的桥梁，显著扩展了qLDPC码在容错量子计算中的应用潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce constructions for non-Abelian qLDPC codes obtained by gauging transversal Clifford gates using measurement and feedback. In particular, we identify two qualitatively different approaches to gauging qLDPC codes to obtain their non-Abelian counterparts. The first approach applies to codes that exhibit a generalized form of Poincaré duality and leads to a qLDPC non-Abelian Clifford stabilizer code, whose stabilizers are reminiscent of the action of a Type-III twisted quantum double. Our second approach applies to general qLDPC codes, and uses a graph of ancilla qubits which may be tailored to properties of the input codes to gauge a single transversal gate. For both constructions, the resulting gauged codes are shown to have properties analogous to 2D non-Abelian topological order -- e.g. the analog of a single anyon on a torus. We conclude by demonstrating that our gauging procedures enable magic state preparation via the measurement of logical Clifford gates. Consequently, our gauging constructions offer a protocol for performing non-Clifford operations on any qLDPC code.

Abstract: The realisation of utility-scale quantum computing inextricably depends on the design of practical, low-overhead fault-tolerant architectures. We introduce the \textit{Pinnacle Architecture}, which uses quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes to allow for universal, fault-tolerant quantum computation with a spacetime overhead significantly smaller than that of any competing architecture. With this architecture, we show that 2048-bit RSA integers can be factored with less than one hundred thousand physical qubits, given a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, code cycle time of $1$ \textmu s and a reaction time of $10$ \textmu s. We thereby demonstrate the feasibility of utility-scale quantum computing with an order of magnitude fewer physical qubits than has previously been believed necessary.

Abstract: Materials defects in Josephson junctions (JJs), often referred to as two-level systems (TLS), couple to superconducting qubits and are a critical bottleneck for scalable quantum processors. Despite their importance, understanding the microscopic sources of TLS and how to mitigate them has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput, correlated approach to trace the microstructural origins of strongly-coupled TLS in Josephson circuits. We assembled a massive dataset of TLS across 6,000 Al/AlOx/Al JJs and more than 600 atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy images. We statistically link fabrication, microstructure, and TLS occurrence, revealing a strong correlation between Al electrode thickness, Al grain size, and TLS density. Correspondingly, we find a two-thirds reduction in TLS prompted by a change in electrode fabrication parameters. These results demonstrate a robust, data-driven methodology to understand and control defects in quantum circuits and pave the way for significantly reducing TLS density.

Abstract: We experimentally studied the switching off processes in the double-resonator coupler superconducting quantum circuit.In both frequency and time-domain, we observed the variation of qubit-qubit effective coupling by tuning qubits'frequencies. According to the measurement results, by just shifting qubits' frequencies smaller than 50 MHz, the effective qubit-qubit coupling strength can be tuned from switching off point to two qubit gate point (effective coupling larger than 5 MHz) in double-resonator superconducting quantum circuit. The double-resonator coupler superconducting quantum circuit has the advantage of simple fabrications, introducing less flux noises, reducing occupancy of dilution refrigerator cables, which might supply a promising platform for future large-scale superconducting quantum processors.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable framework for large-scale QBA networks, providing the foundation for practical quantum blockchain with secure, fault-tolerant decentralized services.

Abstract: Quantum Byzantine Agreement (QBA), a cornerstone of quantum blockchain, offers inherent advantages in security and fault tolerance over classical protocols, guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. However, existing multiparty QBA protocols face challenges for large-scale deployment due to exponential communication complexity or reliance on complex multi-particle entanglement. To address this, we propose a multiparty circular QBA protocol that adopts a semi-decentralized architecture, leveraging circular message gathering and quantum digital signatures to achieve quadratic communication complexity and enhanced fault tolerance. Our protocol is experimentally feasible, requiring only weak coherent states, and is compatible with existing star-shaped quantum networks. Simulations conducted on a global satellite-to-ground network demonstrate that the protocol sustains high consensus rates among multiple users, even when employing different key generation protocols under realistic conditions. This work presents a scalable framework for large-scale QBA networks, establishing the foundation for a practical quantum blockchain that enables secure and fault-tolerant decentralized services.

Motivation: 计算化学中模拟化学反应的核心挑战在于其不均匀的难度分布：反应物和产物的平衡几何结构通常可用经典方法处理，但中间过渡态却表现出强烈的电子关联效应，使得标准近似方法失效。迫切需要开发能够高效处理强关联区域的新算法。

Abstract: Simulating chemical reactions is a central challenge in computational chemistry, characterized by an uneven difficulty profile: while equilibrium reactant and product geometries are often classically tractable, intermediate transition states frequently exhibit strong correlation that defies standard approximations. We present a protocol for dissipative ground state preparation that exploits this structure by treating the reaction path itself as a computational primitive. Our protocol uses an approach where a state prepared at a tractable geometry is propagated along a discretized reaction coordinate using Procrustes-aligned orbital rotations and stabilized by engineered dissipative cooling. We show that for reaction paths satisfying a localized Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) drift condition in the strongly correlated regime, the algorithm prepares ground states of chemical systems with $N_o$ orbitals to an energy error $ε_E$ with a total gate complexity scaling as $\widetilde{O}(N_o^{3}/ε_E)$. We provide logical resource estimates for benchmark systems including FeMoco, Cytochrome P450, and Ru-based carbon capture catalysts.

### [142] [The Power of Two Bases: Robust and copy-optimal certification of nearly all quantum states with few-qubit measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11616)
*Andrea Coladangelo,Jerry Li,Joseph Slote,Ellen Wu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: New quantum state certification protocols solve robustness problem: first achieves constant error tolerance Θ(1) with O(log n)-qubit measurements and optimal copy complexity; second uses only single-qubit measurements with tolerance Ω(1/log n). Both work for nearly all pure target states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum state certification protocols using simple single-qubit measurements lack robustness, only certifying states within O(1/n) trace distance of the target. This makes them impractical for large systems where constant error tolerance is needed.

Method: Developed new robust certification protocols based on few-qubit measurements that work for all but O(2⁻ⁿ)-fraction of pure target states. Introduced a new uncertainty principle for conditional fidelities. First protocol uses single O(log n)-qubit measurement plus single-qubit Z/X basis measurements; second uses exclusively single-qubit measurements.

Result: First protocol achieves constant robustness ε₁ = Θ(1) and optimal constant copy complexity. Second protocol achieves near-robustness ε₁ = Ω(1/log n). Both protocols apply to almost all pure target states with exponentially small exception fraction.

Conclusion: The new protocols overcome the critical robustness limitation of previous quantum state certification methods, enabling practical certification of large-scale quantum systems with constant error tolerance independent of system size.

Abstract: A central task in quantum information science is state certification: testing whether an unknown state is $ε_1$-close to a fixed target state, or $ε_2$-far. Recent work has shown that surprisingly simple measurement protocols--comprising only single-qubit measurements--suffice to certify arbitrary $n$-qubit states [Huang, Preskill, Soleimanifar '25; Gupta, He, O'Donnell '25]. However, these certification protocols are not robust: rather than allowing constant $ε_1$, they can only positively certify states within $ε_1=O(1/n)$ trace distance of the target. In many experimental settings, the appropriate error tolerance is constant as the system size grows, so this lack of robustness renders existing tests inapplicable at scale, no matter how many times the test is repeated.
  Here we present robust certification protocols based on few-qubit measurements that apply to all but a $O(2^{-n})$-fraction of pure target states. Our first protocol achieves constant robustness, i.e. $ε_1=Θ(1)$, using a single $O(\log n)$-qubit measurement along with single-qubit measurements in the $Z$ or $X$ basis on the other qubits. As a corollary of its robustness, this protocol also achieves constant (in $n$) copy complexity, which is optimal. Our second protocol uses exclusively single-qubit measurements and is nearly robust: $ε_1=Ω(1/\log n)$. Our tests are based on a new uncertainty principle for conditional fidelities, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Quantum coherence offers potential for energy conversion technologies. It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed model using an ensemble of Rubidium atoms.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes distributed Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) architectures to enable scalable quantum property learning, demonstrating that entangled subsystem designs reduce resource requirements for reconstructing complex nonlinear quantum features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming quantum hardware limitations requires distributed architectures for scalable quantum information processing; existing QELM methods need efficient schemes to learn quantum state properties using only practical computational basis measurements.

Method: Compares three QELM architectures—standard three-layer, spatially multiplexed (for linear tasks), and novel entangled distributed designs (for nonlinear tasks)—using computational basis measurements to analyze resource requirements (measurements/reservoir size) for learning linear/nonlinear quantum properties.

Result: Spatially multiplexed architecture reduces linear task resources linearly per unit; entangled distributed designs reconstruct higher-order nonlinearities (e.g., polynomial targets, Rényi entropy, entanglement measures) by increasing interacting subsystems—not single-reservoir size—with lower resource costs.

Conclusion: Distributed QELM with entanglement provides a hardware-efficient, scalable route for quantum property learning, prioritizing subsystem interactions over monolithic reservoir scaling to handle complex nonlinear quantum features.

Abstract: Distributed architectures are gaining prominence in quantum machine learning as a means to overcome hardware limitations and enable scalable quantum information processing. In this context, we analyze the design and performance of distributed Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) architectures for learning functions of quantum states directly from data, restricting measurements to easily implementable projective measurements in the computational basis. The aim is to determine which schemes can effectively recover specific properties of input quantum states, including both linear and nonlinear features, while also quantifying the resource requirements in terms of measurements and reservoir dimensionality. We compare standard three-layer QELM with a spatially multiplexed architecture composed of multiple independent three-layer units for linear (quantum) tasks, showing a linear reduction in resource requirements per unit. For nonlinear properties, the study examines the multiple-injection architecture and introduces a novel distributed design that incorporates entanglement between subsystems within a spatially multiplexed framework, evaluating its performance through the reconstruction of complex nonlinear quantities such as polynomial targets, Rényi entropy, and entanglement measures. Our results demonstrate that the distributed design enables the reconstruction of higher-order nonlinearities by increasing the number of interacting subsystems with reduced resources, rather than increasing the size of an individual reservoir, providing a scalable and hardware-efficient route to quantum property learning.

### [145] [Operational limits to entanglement-based satellite quantum key distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11833)
*Jasminder S. Sidhu,Sarah E. McCarthy,Cameron Paterson,Daniel K. L. Oi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper develops a high-fidelity model for satellite-based quantum entanglement distribution that incorporates orbital dynamics, signal loss, and noise effects, then applies finite-key security analysis to optimize quantum key distribution performance across different satellite configurations and ground station setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space-based quantum entanglement is essential for global quantum networks, but entanglement-based QKD suffers from low coincidence rates and severe finite-key effects. There's a critical need to comprehensively study these effects for direct dual downlink QKD while accounting for realistic satellite overpass geometries.

Method: Created a high-fidelity LEO satellite pair distribution model capturing orbital dynamics, elevation-dependent loss, background noise, and detector effects, then integrated it with a rigorous finite-key security framework for the BBM92 protocol.

Result: Achieved quantitative optimization of secret key length across different overpass geometries, orbital altitudes, and optical ground station separations, establishing performance bounds for satellite QKD systems.

Conclusion: The analysis provides design guidelines for near-term SatQKD missions, enabling informed trade-offs between satellite payload complexity, ground infrastructure, and achievable secure key throughput.

Abstract: Space-based distribution of quantum entanglement will be essential for global quantum networking and secure communications. Modelling and analysis of the performance of satellite entanglement pair distribution is important for the architecture and design of constellations and space systems. Entanglement-based quantum key distribution, in the absence of quantum repeaters, is especially prone to finite key effects due to low coincident count rates compared to trusted node single-path links. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive study of finite-key effects in the context of direct dual downlink quantum key distribution taking into account the characteristics of the overpass geometries. We develop a high-fidelity model of pair distribution from a low Earth orbit satellite that captures orbital dynamics, elevation-dependent loss, background noise, and extraneous detector effects. We integrate this with a rigorous finite-key security framework for the BBM92 protocol to optimise secret key length across different overpass geometries, orbital altitudes, and optical ground station (OGS) separations. These results provide quantitative performance bounds and design guidelines for near-term SatQKD missions, enabling informed trade-offs between satellite payload complexity, ground infrastructure, and achievable secure key throughput.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a practical recipe to transform any depth-$L$ block of CNOTs that prepares $n$-qubit GHZ states into an $n$-qubit fanout gate (multitarget-CNOT) of depth $2L-1$, without the need for ancilla qubits. Considering known logarithmic-depth circuits to prepare GHZ-states, this allows us to construct an $n$-qubit fanout gate with depth $2\log_2(n)-1$, reproducing previous ancillaless constructions. We employ our recipe to construct $n$-qubit fanout gates under heavy-hex connectivity restrictions, obtaining a depth of $O(n^{1/2})$, again reproducing previous complexity theory constructions. Using this recipe on the \textit{ibm\_fez} architecture yields a $156$-qubit fanout construction with depth $33$. Additionally, we show how to employ these $n$-qubit fanout constructions to measure complete sets of commuting observables from the $n$-body Pauli group with the same depth, allowing for efficient single-shot characterization of any GHZ-like state in a given known basis, e.g. fully characterizing a single copy of a $156$-qubit GHZ state using circuit depth $33$ in $\textit{ibm\_fez}$ (its preparation requires an additional depth of $17$).

### [147] [Universal Sequential Changepoint Detection of Quantum Observables via Classical Shadows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11846)
*Matteo Zecchin,Osvaldo Simeone,Aaditya Ramdas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes eSCD, a universal quantum changepoint detection protocol that uses classical shadows and e-detectors to achieve competitive performance without knowing which observables the detector will use, with theoretical guarantees on detection delay and false alarm control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In quantum changepoint detection, traditional methods require knowing which observables the detector will monitor, but this is unrealistic when measurement and detection modules are separate. The paper aims to create a universal measurement strategy that works for any unknown detector observables while maintaining statistical performance guarantees.

Method: The authors introduce shadow-based sequential changepoint e-detection (eSCD), which combines: (1) classical shadows as a universal measurement approach that works for any choice of observables, and (2) e-detectors as a nonparametric sequential testing framework that explicitly controls average run length to false alarm. This architecture assumes the measurement device doesn't know which observables are relevant to the detector.

Result: Theoretical analysis establishes finite-sample guarantees on the worst-case expected detection delay of eSCD under an ARL constraint. Numerical experiments demonstrate that eSCD achieves performance competitive with observable-specific measurement strategies while maintaining full measurement universality.

Conclusion: eSCD successfully provides a universal, practical protocol for quantum changepoint detection that requires no prior knowledge of detector observables, achieves statistical performance guarantees, and performs comparably to specialized methods through the combination of classical shadows and e-detector frameworks.

Abstract: We study sequential quantum changepoint detection in settings where the pre- and post-change regimes are specified through constraints on the expectation values of a finite set of observables. We consider an architecture with separate measurement and detection modules, and assume that the observables relevant to the detector are unknown to the measurement device. For this scenario, we introduce shadow-based sequential changepoint e-detection (eSCD), a novel protocol that combines a universal measurement strategy based on classical shadows with a nonparametric sequential test built on e-detectors. Classical shadows provide universality with respect to the detector's choice of observables, while the e-detector framework enables explicit control of the average run length (ARL) to false alarm. Under an ARL constraint, we establish finite-sample guarantees on the worst-case expected detection delay of eSCD. Numerical experiments validate the theory and demonstrate that eSCD achieves performance competitive with observable-specific measurement strategies, while retaining full measurement universality.

Abstract: The logistics industry is widely regarded as a promising application domain for emerging optimization paradigms, including quantum computing. The Rider-Order Assignment problem is a practically motivated optimization problem arising in online food delivery and related logistics applications. While the problem is closely related to the classical matching problem, the inclusion of realistic operational constraints renders it computationally challenging. In this work, we formulate the Rider-Order Assignment problem as a constrained binary optimization problem and perform a comparative analysis of classical, quantum-inspired, and gate-based quantum solvers for this problem across multiple instance sizes. Solver performance is assessed using solution quality, computational runtime, and constraint satisfaction, with a consistent post-processing procedure applied to ensure feasibility.

Abstract: Superconducting qubit parameters drift on sub-second timescales, motivating calibration and benchmarking techniques that can be executed on millisecond timescales. We demonstrate an on-FPGA workflow that co-locates pulse generation, data acquisition, analysis, and feed-forward, eliminating CPU round trips. Within this workflow, we introduce sparse-sampling and on-FPGA inference tools, including computationally efficient methods for estimation of exponential and sine-like response functions, as well as on-FPGA implementations of Nelder-Mead optimization and golden-section search. These methods enable low-latency primitives for readout calibration, spectroscopy, pulse-amplitude calibration, coherence estimation, and benchmarking. We deploy this toolset to estimate $T_1$ in 10 ms, optimize readout parameters in 100 ms, optimize pulse amplitudes in 1 ms, and perform Clifford randomized gate benchmarking in 107 ms on a flux-tunable superconducting transmon qubit. Running a closed-loop on-FPGA recalibration protocol continuously for 6 hours enables more than 74,000 consecutive recalibrations and yields gate errors that consistently retain better performance than the baseline initial calibration. Correlation analysis shows that recalibration suppresses coupling of gate error to control-parameter drift while preserving a coherence-linked performance. Finally, we quantify uncertainty versus time-to-decision under our sparse sampling approaches and identify optimal parameter regimes for efficient estimation of qubit and pulse parameters.

Abstract: Quantum subspace diagonalization and quantum Krylov algorithms offer a feasible, pre- or early-fault tolerant alternative to quantum phase estimation for using quantum computers to estimate the low-lying spectra of quantum systems. However, despite promising proof-of-principle results, such methods suffer from high sensitivity to noise (including intrinsic sources such as sampling noise), making their utility for realistic industry-relevant problems an open question. To improve the potential applicability of such methods, we introduce a new variant of thresholding for noisy generalized eigenvalue problems that arise in quantum subspace diagonalization that has the potential to better control sensitivity to noise. Our approach leverages eigenvector-preserving transformations (rotations) of the generalized eigenvalue problem prior to thresholding. We study this effect in practical settings by applying this rotation thresholding scheme to an iterative quantum Krylov algorithm for several chemical systems, including the industry-relevant Fe(III)-NTA chelate complex. We develop a particular heuristic to select the rotation angle from noisy data and find for certain systems and noise regimes that the samples required to reach a target error for ground state estimation can be reduced by a factor of up to 100. Furthermore, with oracle access to the optimal transformation, more dramatic improvements are possible and we observe reductions in sample requirements by up to $10^4$, motivating the continued development of methods that can realize these improvements in practice. While we develop our approach in the context of quantum subspace diagonalization, the improved thresholding scheme we develop could be advantageous in any context where one must solve noisy, ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problems.

Abstract: Preparing arbitrary quantum states requires exponential resources. Matrix Product States (MPS) admit more efficient constructions, particularly when accuracy is traded for circuit complexity. Existing approaches to MPS preparation mostly rely on heuristic circuits that are deterministic but quickly saturate in accuracy, or on variational optimization methods that reach high fidelities but scale poorly. This work introduces an end-to-end MPS preparation framework that combines the strengths of both strategies within a single pipeline. Heuristic staircase-like and brick wall disentangler circuits provide warm-start initializations for variational optimization, enabling high-fidelity state preparation for large systems. Target MPSs are either specified as physical quantum states or constructed from classical datasets via amplitude encoding, using step-by-step singular value decompositions or tensor cross interpolation. The framework incorporates entanglement-based qubit reordering, reformulated as a quadratic assignment problem, and low-level optimizations that reduce depths by up to 50% and CNOT counts by 33%. We evaluate the full pipeline on datasets of varying complexity across systems of 19-50 qubits and identify trade-offs between fidelity, gate count, and circuit depth. Optimized brick wall circuits typically achieve the lowest depths, while the optimized staircase-like circuits minimize gate counts. Overall, our results provide principled and scalable protocols for preparing MPSs as quantum circuits, supporting utility-scale applications on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: Quantum sensors based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been a central topic in the sensing community for more than a decade. The extraordinary properties at room temperature of the spin system in diamond have made it one of the most prominent quantum platforms for the development of commercial quantum sensors. In particular, the sensitivity of the electronic spin in NV centers has made diamond-based magnetic sensors of special interest for their potential application in medical, industrial or navigation solutions. However, the use of these sensors for universal vector magnetometry was constrained by the need for previous knowledge on the field being measured to fully exploit their benefits. In this work, we show a method to perform unconditional vector magnetometry without the need of external information on the magnetic field, based only on the spatial arrangement of the diamond and the microwave antenna combination. While previous NV-based vector magnetometry methods require partial knowledge of the magnetic field (e.g. a calibrated bias field), we exploit the possibilities of selecting particular directions of the spins in the diamond with elliptically polarized microwave fields. We prove that our method allows to estimate both magnitude and direction of external magnetic fields without further assumptions or constraints.

TL;DR: This paper resolves the hierarchy of commutativity conditions needed to saturate the quantum Cramér-Rao bound for multiparameter estimation, showing gaps between conditions and that commutativity alone fails with realistic noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quantum Cramér-Rao bound sets ultimate precision limits for multiparameter estimation, but unlike single-parameter case, its saturability isn't guaranteed and depends on poorly understood commutativity conditions, especially under realistic noisy conditions with mixed states.

Method: Analyzing logical hierarchy of commutativity-based conditions for unitary parameter-encoding transformations, constructing explicit counterexamples, and identifying strict gaps and missing implications between different classes of conditions.

Result: Commutativity of parameter-encoding generators alone does not ensure QCR bound saturability when realistic noise produces mixed probe states; provides systematic classification of saturability conditions.

Conclusion: The work clarifies fundamental precision limits in noisy distributed quantum sensing beyond idealized pure-state settings, providing a systematic framework for assessing when quantum multiparameter estimation can achieve ultimate precision bounds.

Abstract: The quantum Cramér-Rao (QCR) bound sets the ultimate local precision limit for unbiased multiparameter estimation. Yet, unlike in the single-parameter case, its saturability is not generally guaranteed and is often assessed through commutativity-based conditions. Here, we resolve the logical hierarchy of these commutativity conditions for unitary parameter-encoding transformations. We identify strict gaps between them, uncover previously assumed but missing implications, and construct explicit counterexamples to characterize the boundaries between distinct classes. In particular, we show that commutativity of the parameter-encoding generators alone does not ensure the saturability of the QCR bound once realistic noise produces mixed probe states. Our results provide a systematic classification of saturability conditions in multiparameter quantum metrology and clarify fundamental precision limits in noisy distributed quantum sensing beyond idealized pure-state settings.

Conclusion: RSE为单模/多模玻色系统提供可扩展、解析透明的大规模态工程与量子门综合框架，突破传统确定性方案复杂度限制

Abstract: Deterministic preparation of high-excitation Fock states is a central challenge in bosonic quantum information, with control complexity that generically explodes as the Hilbert space dimension grows. Here we introduce resonant subspace engineering (RSE), a protocol that analytically confines the infinite-dimensional bosonic dynamics to a two-dimensional invariant subspace spanned by an initial coherent state and the target state. State transfer then reduces to a geodesic rotation on a synthetic Bloch sphere, governed by resonance and phase-matching conditions we derive in closed form. For single Fock states, RSE achieves $O(n^{1/4})$ scaling in both evolution time and gate depth, showing a fundamental improvement over existing deterministic schemes. The construction generalizes to $K$-component superpositions via a $(K{+}1)$-dimensional invariant subspace with full $\mathrm{SU}(K{+}1)$ controllability, requiring only 3-5 iterations of operations for superpositions spanning photon numbers 70--100. RSE provides a scalable and analytically transparent framework for large-scale bosonic state engineering and gate synthesis across single- and multimode platforms.

TL;DR: This paper applies analytical and algebraic geometry to spatial quantum sensing, demonstrating that entangled sensor networks achieve optimal precision for estimating field properties like signal sources or field values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop estimators for field properties (distinguishing signal sources, evaluating field/derivatives) using quantum sensor networks, and to understand the role of entanglement in improving precision for distributed sensing across scales from Earth-sized to biological experiments.

Method: Uses analytical and algebraic geometry tools. Starts with polynomial field assumption (interpolation problem) then generalizes to analytical functions for general least-squares estimators. Analyzes sensor placement effects, provides concrete examples/proofs for m-dimensional sensor arrays, and compares entangled versus local strategies.

Result: Non-local entangled strategies provide maximum precision for field property estimators. Provides necessary and sufficient conditions for error-free sensor placements and demonstrates precision benefits of entanglement over local strategies in distributed sensing scenarios.

Conclusion: Entangled quantum sensor networks offer superior precision and are a key tool for wide-ranging sensing problems, from large-scale Earth experiments to local-scale biological applications.

Abstract: Analytical and algebraic geometry are valuable tools for dealing with problems involving analytical functions and polynomials. In what we connote as spatial quantum sensing the goal is, given an underlying field and a set of quantum sensors interrogating the field in a set of positions, to find an estimator for some property the field. This property can have multiple forms, be it distinguishing the source of a target signal, or evaluating the field (or a derivative thereof) in an arbitrary position. In this work we also link this problem to networks of quantum sensors, and the role and usefulness of entangling these sensors. We find that the estimators that come out as a solution to the problem are such that a non-local entangled strategy provides maximum precision. We start by working under the assumption of polynomial fields, which relates to the interpolation problem, and then generalize for any signal that is modeled via analytical functions, giving rise to any general least-squares estimator. We discuss the effects of the placement of the sensors in the estimation, namely, how to find well defined, construction error-free placements for the sensors. In the case of interpolation we provide concrete examples and proofs in a $m$-dimensional array of sensors, and discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for the more general cases. We provide clear examples of the possible use-cases and statements, and compare a non-local entangled strategy with the best local strategy for an interpolation problem, showing the benefit in terms of precision in a distributed sensing scenario. This is a key tool for a wide-range of problem in sensing problems, ranging from large-scale such as earth-sized experiments, to local-scale, such has biological experiments.

Abstract: Operating matter-wave interferometers as quantum detectors for fundamental physics or inertial sensors in real-world applications with unprecedented accuracies relies on noise rejection, often implemented by correlating two sensors. Such sensors can be spatially separated (gradiometry or gravitational-wave detection) or consist of different internal states (magnetometry or quantum clock interferometry), in which case a signal-amplitude modulation may serve as a signature of a differential phase. In this work, we introduce Phase Estimation from Amplitude Collapse (PEAC) by applying targeted fitting methods for different magnetically sensitive substates of an atom interferometer. We demonstrate that PEAC provides higher trueness (up to 80% bias reduction) than standard tools for perfectly correlated signals. At its working point near, but not exactly at phase settings resulting in vanishing amplitude, it achieves precision competitive with standard methods, contrasting prior claims of optimal operation at vanishing amplitude. PEAC presents a generally applicable complementary evaluation method for correlated interferometers without phase stability, increasing the overall accuracy and enabling applications beyond atom interferometry.

Abstract: The standard approach to quantum measurement discrimination is to perform the given unknown measurement on a probe state, possibly entangled with an auxiliary system, and make a decision based on the measurement outcome obtained. In this work, we go beyond the standard aforementioned scenarios by consider not only the classical measurement outcome of a measurement, but also its the post-measurement quantum state. More specifically, instead of considering only the positive-operator valued measure (POVM) operators, we consider their associated Lüders' instrument associated with them. We prove that, when the post-measurement quantum states are available, the task of discriminating two qubit projective measurements is equivalent to discriminating two copies of quantum states associated to each projector pair, extending previous results known for the case where probe states are separable. Then, we proceed by showing that the advantage of considering post-measurement states in measurement discrimination can be large. We formalise this claim by presenting a family of pairs of measurements where the ratio between the discrimination bias of the measurement discrimination task with and without post-measurement states can be arbitrarily large. This shows that, while the post-measurement state was neglected in most of the previous literature, its use can significantly improve the performance of quantum measurement discrimination.

Abstract: We show that a single spatially superposed 'source' mass acting on a 'probe' matter wavepacket can reveal the quantum nature of the gravitational field. For this we use a specific state preparation and measurement of the superposed source mass, including a postselection, which altogether results in a repulsive gravitational force on the probe particle. A classical gravitational field can never lead to repulsion, as the effect requires quantum interference of two distinct states of gravity. We also present a calculation in the Heisenberg picture under the formalism of weak values that illustrates how repulsion is achieved. Finally, we estimate the range of parameters (masses and the spatio-temporal extent of interference) for which the experiment is feasible.

Abstract: Certification is important to guarantee the correct functioning of quantum devices. A key certification task is verifying that a device has produced a desired output state. In this work, we study this task in the context of photonic platforms, where single photons are propagated through linear optical interferometers to create large, entangled resource states for metrology, communication, quantum advantage demonstrations and for so-called linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). This setting derives its computational power from the indistinguishability of the photons, i.e., their relative overlap. Therefore, standard fidelity witnesses developed for distinguishable particles (including qubits) do not apply directly, because they merely certify the closeness to some fixed target state. We introduce a measure of fidelity suitable for this setting and show several different ways to witness it, based on earlier proposals for measuring genuine multi-photon indistinguishability. We argue that a witness based upon the discrete Fourier transform is an optimal choice. We experimentally implement this witness and certify the fidelity of several multi-photon states.

Conclusion: Sondheimer振荡提供普适性特征集，可在中等场/高温条件下有效区分赝能隙相的不同费米面重构机制，为强关联体系研究提供新实验探针。

Abstract: Determining the Fermi surface (FS) volume in underdoped cuprates is crucial for understanding the nature of the strongly correlated pseudogap phase. Conventional quantum oscillation techniques, typically used for this purpose, are inapplicable in this high-temperature regime due to thermal and disorder-induced smearing of Landau levels. We propose Sondheimer oscillations (SO), semiclassical oscillations of in-plane magnetoresistivity in thin films, as a robust alternative probe of FS reconstruction. SO arise from the commensuration between the cyclotron radius and film thickness, do not rely on Landau quantization, and remain observable at moderate fields and elevated temperatures where quantum oscillations are suppressed. Their frequencies depend solely on the FS parameters (e.g., curvature), and not on specific details of scattering mechanisms. SO are also sensitive to the coherence of inter-layer tunneling, allow contributions from individual FS pockets to be distinguished in the frequency domain, and naturally include the Yamaji angle effect (if present in the system) as a prominent feature in the frequency spectrum. We compute SO spectra as a function of the magnetic field orientation for three representative scenarios: (i) an unreconstructed large FS, (ii) a spin density wave reconstructed FS with volume $p/4$, and (iii) a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL$^*$) with pocket volume $p/8$ (here $p$ is the hole doping). We show that the SO spectrum offers a wealth of universal features that could be used to differentiate between these scenarios. In particular, we highlight a FS geometry-dependent phase shift between oscillations in longitudinal and transverse conductivities, characterize how the FS curvature can be extracted from SO if the film orientation is perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$-axis, and analyze the evolution of the SO spectrum with doping.

*Nandagopal Manoj,Valerio Peri,Jason Alicea*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper revisits electron behavior in 3D strong magnetic fields, revealing how interactions and symmetry breaking create novel quantum states like nematic charge density waves and layered superconductors instead of conventional superconductivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the long-standing puzzle of why strong magnetic fields suppress superconductivity in 3D electron gases, and explore how physical deformations (interactions, spin, symmetry breaking) alter the competition between charge density waves (CDW) and superconductivity in high-field regimes.

Method: Theoretically re-examines spin-polarized electrons in Landau levels using generalized local interactions, higher Landau level bands, restored spin degrees of freedom, and explicit spatial symmetry breaking (e.g., translation symmetry), with numerical validation of stability under dipole conservation symmetries.

Result: (1) Generic interactions stabilize a nematic CDW with spontaneously tilted quantum Hall layers causing unconventional Hall response; (2) Non-Fermi liquid state remains stable under dipole-conserving perturbations; (3) Broken translation symmetry triggers a layered superconductor with Weyl nodes, intra-layer superconductivity, and transverse insulation.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate rich quantum phase competition in high magnetic fields, expanding potential pathways for designing field-resistant superconductivity in low-carrier-density materials through controlled symmetry engineering and interaction tuning.

Abstract: Three-dimensional electron gases in strong magnetic fields host partially flat bands that disperse along the field direction yet exhibit Landau-level quantization in the transverse dimensions. Early work established that for spin-polarized electrons confined to the lowest Landau level band, repulsion triggers a charge density wave (CDW) in which electrons 'self-layer' into integer quantum Hall states, while attraction generates a non-Fermi liquid (rather than a superconductor). We revisit this problem with physically motivated deformations -- including generalized local interactions, higher Landau level bands, restoration of spin, and explicit breaking of spatial symmetries -- paying particular attention to the competition between CDWs and superconductivity. Our main findings are: (1) Generic local interactions can stabilize a nematic CDW in which integer quantum Hall layers spontaneously 'tilt', yielding unconventional Hall response. (2) We numerically establish that the non-Fermi liquid appears stable to perturbations that preserve effective dipole conservation symmetries that emerge within a Landau level band. (3) Upon explicitly breaking translation symmetry, attraction catalyzes a novel layered superconductor that hosts Weyl nodes, superconducts within each layer, and insulates transverse to the layers. These results expand the rich phenomenology of interacting bulk electrons in the high-field regime and potentially inform the design of field-resistant superconductivity in low-carrier-density materials.

Abstract: We have experimentally investigated the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) of a prototype spin-frustrated one-dimensional spin-chain system, the famous Haldane-chain system, R2BaNiO5 (R = Nd, Gd, Er, Dy). The significant MCE is observed far above long-range ordering, even in the paramagnetic region, which is attributed to the change in magnetic entropy due to short-range spin correlation arising from (low-dimensional) magnetic frustration. Such a spin-chain incipient MCE above long-range ordering is rarely reported. Interestingly, multiple magnetocaloric switching from conventional to inverse MCE (and vice versa) are observed below long-range magnetic ordering, as a function of temperature and magnetic field, for the R = Nd, Dy, and Er members. However, such MCE switching is absent in the Gd member, which is an S-state atom (orbital moment L = 0). Our systematic investigation of this series demonstrates that the interplay between crystal-electric field (CEF), strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rare earth anisotropy of R-ions play an important role in spin reorientation, leading to multiple MCE switching due to intriguing changes in magnetic and lattice entropy. The maximum change of entropy for Er, Gd, Dy and Nd is 7.8, 6.8, 4.0 and 1.0 J Kg-1 K-1 respectively. Our study presents a pathway for tuning MCE switching and the MCE effect over large temperature regions in d-f coupled spin-frustrated and spin-chain oxide systems.

Abstract: Inspired by recent discovery of metallic $d$-wave altermagnetism in KV$_2$Se$_2$O, we develop a self-consistent microscopic many-body calculation of density-wave order for an itinerant altermagnetic metal. We show that the strong $d$-wave spin-momentum locking inherent to the altermagnetic band structure reconstructs the Fermi surface into spin-selective quasi-1D open sheets. This unique topology of Fermi surface drives an instability toward spin-resolved electronic charge density waves (CDWs), in which the ordering wave vectors for spin-up and spin-down electrons condense along two mutually orthogonal directions, forming spin-resolved stripe phases. As a consequence, this results in pronounced gap openings near the Fermi surface, and the superposition of these spin-resolved stripe orders leads to a checkerboard CDW in the charge channel and an antiphase spin-density-wave modulation in the spin channel. Upon increasing temperature, the density-wave order melts at $T_c$ due to thermal phase fluctuation while the gap opening persists, giving rise to a robust pseudogap regime, which eventually closes at a higher temperature $T_g$. The resulting simulations quantitatively reproduce the key features observed in the spectroscopic measurements, offering a consistent and generic understanding of the reported phenomena in KV$_2$Se$_2$O and, more broadly, in metallic altermagnets with strong spin-momentum locking.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于“对称性跨度”的新机制，通过将全局对称性嵌入两个更大对称性中，迫使量子系统在红外线下无能隙。该机制适用于离散和非反常连续对称性，并在1+1维中构造了具体例子和格点实现。

Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖反常匹配来确立对称性强制的无能隙性，但该方法可能局限于连续对称性。本研究旨在拓展这一现象，使其适用于离散和非反常连续对称性，这些对称性具有成熟的格点实现。

Method: 引入对称性跨度概念，其中对称性ℰ同时嵌入到两个更大的对称性𝒞和𝒟中。论证任何具有完整对称性的有能隙相在限制到ℰ时，必须同时源自𝒞-对称和𝒟-对称的有能隙相；若不存在这样的兼容相，则无能隙性被强制。在1+1维中构造显式例子，并用量子场论和格点哈密顿量实现。

Result: 在1+1维中成功构造了对称性跨度，展示了其在共形场论中的实现，并提供了具有相关对称性嵌入的格点哈密顿量。

Conclusion: 对称性跨度机制为对称性强制的无能隙性提供了新途径，超越了反常匹配，尤其适用于离散和非反常对称性，有助于理解量子系统的低能行为。

Abstract: Anomaly matching for continuous symmetries has been the primary tool for establishing symmetry enforced gaplessness - the phenomenon where global symmetry alone forces a quantum system to be gapless in the infrared. We introduce a new mechanism based on \textit{symmetry spans}: configurations in which a global symmetry $\mathcal{E}$ is simultaneously embedded into two larger symmetries, as $\mathcal{D}\hookleftarrow\mathcal{E}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{C}$. Any gapped phase with the full symmetry must, upon restriction to $\mathcal{E}$, arise as the restriction of both a gapped $\mathcal{C}$-symmetric phase and a gapped $\mathcal{D}$-symmetric phase. When no such compatible phase exists, gaplessness is enforced. This mechanism can operate with only discrete and non-anomalous continuous symmetries in the UV, both of which admit well-understood lattice realizations. We construct explicit symmetry spans enforcing gaplessness in 1+1 dimensions, exhibit their realization in conformal field theories, and provide lattice Hamiltonians with the relevant symmetry embeddings.

Abstract: We investigate the spectral statistics of an interacting fermionic system derived by projecting the Hubbard interaction onto the two lowest-energy, degenerate flat bands of the dice lattice subjected to a $π$-flux. Surprisingly, the distributions of level spacings and gap ratios correspond to distinct Gaussian ensembles, depending on the parity of the particle number. For an even number of particles, the spectra conform to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, as expected for a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian. In stark contrast, the odd-parity sector exhibits exact double degeneracy of all eigenstates even after resolving all known symmetries, and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble accurately describes the spacing distribution between these doublets. The simultaneous emergence of two different random-matrix ensembles within a single physical system constitutes an unprecedented finding, opening new avenues for both random matrix theory and flat-band physics.

Abstract: We report calorimetric, magnetic, and neutron scattering studies on an S = 5/2, nearly Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K2Mn(SeO3)2 with weak XXZ easy-axis anisotropy. Multiple magnetic phases are identified, including a non-collinear Y phase in zero field, a field-induced collinear m = 1/3 magnetization plateau, and a high-field V phase. In the Y phase, the magnetic excitation spectrum exhibits both single-magnon excitations and an extended high-energy continuum. Both features are well described by non-linear spin wave theory. In the field-induced phases, complex effects of the spectrum renormalization even for large S = 5/2 material are clearly detectable. These results underscore the essential role of magnon-magnon interactions in the dynamics of large-S Heisenberg spin systems on a triangular lattice.

TL;DR: This paper develops an index theory for non-invertible symmetries in 1+1D quantum systems using tensor networks, introducing "topological injective MPOs" that generalize previous work on invertible symmetries and showing connections to weakly integral fusion categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize non-invertible symmetry operators in 1+1 dimensions and understand their realizability on lattice tensor product Hilbert spaces, generalizing the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index for invertible quantum cellular automata to a broader class of symmetries relevant for quantum phases of matter.

Method: Proposes a generalized index for non-invertible symmetries; introduces topological injective matrix product operators (MPOs) as a unifying framework; constructs defect Hilbert spaces and sequential quantum circuit representations; analyzes fusion rules and index consistency conditions.

Result: Shows that fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators (up to quantum cellular automata) must correspond to weakly integral fusion categories; proves that all fusion channels share the same index when appropriate fusion/splitting tensors exist; explicitly constructs these tensors for invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and Kramers-Wannier symmetries.

Conclusion: The topological injective MPO framework successfully unifies various symmetry types and establishes a foundation for non-invertible symmetry index theory, though general existence of required fusion/splitting tensors remains unproven beyond the constructed examples.

Abstract: We propose an index of non-invertible symmetry operators in 1+1 dimensions and discuss its relation to the realizability of non-invertible symmetries on the tensor product of finite dimensional on-site Hilbert spaces on the lattice. Our index generalizes the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index of invertible symmetry operators represented by quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.

Abstract: Heavy-fermion metals are prototype correlated electron systems for the study of Kondo entanglement and quantum criticality. We use the symmetry decomposed elastoresistance to uncover the fingerprints of strain-dependent Kondo scattering as function of temperature and magnetic field in the prototypical tetragonal Kondo lattice YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. By combining longitudinal and transverse resistance measurements under uniaxial strain applied along the tetragonal $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions, we obtain the elastoresistive responses in the $A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels. While the responses in the symmetry-breaking channels are negligible, the isotropic $A_{1g}$ elastoresistance displays characteristic sign changes and approaches huge values at low temperatures. Scaling analysis and comparison with linear thermal expansion measurements reveals that the elastoresistance probes the contribution of Kondo scattering to the strain dependence of magnetic entropy and signals strain-controlled quantum criticality upon cooling to 2 K.

Abstract: Topological boundary modes, a hallmark of quantum topological phases, remarkably occur in classical mechanical systems through an interesting correspondence with the quantum case. Here, we explore the Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators and argue that the combination of the intrinsic spin-lattice coupling and the spin exchanges could induce the topological mechanics with topological boundary floppy modes in the phonon spectra. This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagomé lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes. We expect this work to inspire interests in the Maxwell lattice Mott insulating materials and the coupling between lattices and electronic orders.

  The directed clique number of a directed graph $G$ is defined as the minimum size of the maximum clique in the backedge graph $G^\ll$ taken over all linear orders $\ll$ on the vertices of $G$.
  A natural computational problem is to decide for a given directed graph $G$ and a positive integer $t$, if the directed clique number of $G$ is at most $t$.
  This problem has polynomial algorithm for $t=1$ and is known to be \NP-complete for every fixed $t\ge3$, even for tournaments.
  In this note we prove that this problem is $Σ^\mathsf{P}_{2}$-complete when $t$ is given on the input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: The complexity of bilinear maps (equivalently, of $3$-mode tensors) has been studied extensively, most notably in the context of matrix multiplication. While circuit complexity and tensor rank coincide asymptotically for $3$-mode tensors, this correspondence breaks down for $d \geq 4$ modes. As a result, the complexity of $d$-mode tensors for larger fixed $d$ remains poorly understood, despite its relevance, e.g., in fine-grained complexity. Our paper explores this intermediate regime. First, we give a "graph-theoretic" proof of Strassen's $2ω/3$ bound on the asymptotic rank exponent of $3$-mode tensors. Our proof directly generalizes to an upper bound of $(d-1)ω/3$ for $d$-mode tensors. Using refined techniques available only for $d\geq 4$ modes, we improve this bound beyond the current state of the art for $ω$. We also obtain a bound of $d/2+1$ on the asymptotic exponent of circuit complexity of generic $d$-mode tensors and optimized bounds for $d \in \{4,5\}$. To the best of our knowledge, asymptotic circuit complexity (rather than rank) of tensors has not been studied before. To obtain a robust theory, we first ask whether low complexity of $T$ and $U$ imply low complexity of their Kronecker product $T \otimes U$. While this crucially holds for rank (and thus for circuit complexity in $3$ modes), we show that assumptions from fine-grained complexity rule out such a submultiplicativity for the circuit complexity of tensors with many modes. In particular, assuming the Hyperclique Conjecture, this failure occurs already for $d=8$ modes. Nevertheless, we can salvage a restricted notion of submultiplicativity. From a technical perspective, our proofs heavily make use of the graph tensors $T_H$, as employed by Christandl and Zuiddam ({\em Comput.~Complexity}~28~(2019)~27--56) and [...]

*Yuki Koyano,Jerzy Górecki,Hiroyuki Kitahata*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: This paper studies camphor disk motion on water, modeling how a mobile disk interacts with a fixed camphor source. It reveals an asymmetric velocity change during approach versus recession.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and model the experimentally observed position-dependent velocity of a self-propelled camphor rotor when interacting with a fixed camphor disk.

Method: Developed a 1D model using a distance-dependent potential to represent rotor-perturbation interaction. Validated via numerical simulations against experimental data and derived analytical solutions for weak perturbations.

Result: Both simulations and analytical solutions show a pronounced asymmetry: the rotor's velocity changes differently when approaching versus receding from the fixed perturbation, matching experimental observations.

Conclusion: The model successfully reproduces key experimental features, and analytical solutions for weak perturbations demonstrate the universal nature of the observed velocity asymmetry.

Abstract: Camphor is a well-studied material capable of generating self-propelled motion at a water surface, and the resulting dynamics can exhibit a wide range of behaviors. Here, we analyze a one-dimensional model describing a mobile camphor disk perturbed by a second localized camphor source. The interaction between the rotor and the perturbing disk is represented by a distance-dependent potential. The study is motivated by experiments in which a camphor rotor interacts with a fixed camphor disk placed on the water surface. Numerical simulations of the model reproduce the essential features of the experimentally observed position-dependent rotor velocity for all considered forms of the potential. For weak perturbations, we derive analytical solutions valid for arbitrary potential profiles. Both the simulations and the analytical results demonstrate a pronounced asymmetry in the rotor velocity depending on whether the rotor approaches or recedes from the perturbation.

TL;DR: 本文为无代码ML平台DashAI开发了一个以人为本的XAI模块，集成PDP、PFI和KernelSHAP三种技术。20名新手和专家的用户研究表明，该模块任务成功率高（≥80%），新手满意度高，但专家对充分性和完整性要求更高，揭示了XAI在无代码平台中平衡可访问性与技术深度的核心挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在医疗、金融和公共政策等敏感领域的应用日益增多，自动化决策的透明度问题引发关注。可解释AI（XAI）虽能阐明模型预测机制，但多数方法需要专业技术知识，限制了对非专业用户的价值。这在无代码ML平台中尤为关键——此类平台旨在普及AI却很少包含可解释性功能。

Method: 作者在开源无代码ML平台DashAI中设计了一个以人为本的XAI模块，针对表格分类任务集成部分依赖图（PDP）、排列特征重要性（PFI）和KernelSHAP三种互补技术。通过20名ML新手和专家的用户研究，评估了系统的可用性以及解释效果的影响。

Result: 研究结果包括：（1）所有可解释性任务的成功率达到80%以上；（2）新手在解释满意度量表（ESS，Cronbach's α=0.74）上将解释评为有用、准确且值得信赖，而专家对充分性和完整性更为苛刻；（3）解释提升了自动化信任量表（TiA，α=0.60）中的可预测性和信心感知，且新手表现出比专家更高的信任度。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了无代码ML中XAI的核心挑战：如何使解释既对新手易于理解，又对专家足够详尽。该研究为无代码AI平台的可解释性设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy has raised concerns about the transparency of automated decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\geq80\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $α$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $α$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts. These findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML, making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts.

### [174] [On Decision-Valued Maps and Representational Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11295)
*Gil Raitses*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper formalizes decision-valued maps to track how different data representations affect computational outcomes, and presents DecisionDB - an infrastructure using content-based write-once identifiers to log, deterministically replay, and audit these relationships while partitioning representation space into mechanically checkable persistence regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational engines can produce different discrete outcomes from different representations of the same data, but there's no systematic way to track which representations preserve results versus change them, making it difficult to audit or reuse decisions reliably.

Method: Formalizes decision-valued maps that associate each representation in a family with its produced discrete outcome, and builds DecisionDB infrastructure that logs/audits these relationships using content-addressed identifiers stored in write-once storage.

Result: Achieves deterministic replay that exactly recovers recorded decision identifiers from stored artifacts (all three identifying fields match persisted values), and partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries where decision reuse becomes a mechanically verifiable condition.

Conclusion: Provides a formal framework for treating decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition, enabling reliable auditing and replay of representation-dependent computational outcomes through persistence region partitioning.

Abstract: A computational engine applied to different representations of the same data can produce different discrete outcomes, with some representations preserving the result and others changing it entirely. A decision-valued map records which representations preserve the outcome and which change it, associating each member of a declared representation family with the discrete result it produces. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps and describes DecisionDB, an infrastructure that logs, replays and audits these relationships using identifiers computed from content and artifacts stored in write-once form. Deterministic replay recovers each recorded decision identifier exactly from stored artifacts, with all three identifying fields matching their persisted values. The contribution partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries, and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges the performance gap between streaming and offline ASR, proving that end-to-end streaming training is viable for production-quality transcription. Model weights are released under Apache 2.0 license.

Abstract: We introduce Voxtral Realtime, a natively streaming automatic speech recognition model that matches offline transcription quality at sub-second latency. Unlike approaches that adapt offline models through chunking or sliding windows, Voxtral Realtime is trained end-to-end for streaming, with explicit alignment between audio and text streams. Our architecture builds on the Delayed Streams Modeling framework, introducing a new causal audio encoder and Ada RMS-Norm for improved delay conditioning. We scale pretraining to a large-scale dataset spanning 13 languages. At a delay of 480ms, Voxtral Realtime achieves performance on par with Whisper, the most widely deployed offline transcription system. We release the model weights under the Apache 2.0 license.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This systematic review critiques the "ground truth" paradigm in ML, revealing how annotation practices create a "consensus trap" that treats human disagreement as noise rather than meaningful signal. Analyzing 346 papers from 2020-2025, the study exposes systemic biases from geographic hegemony, economic pressures on data workers, and model-mediated annotations that silence diverse human perspectives, proposing pluralistic annotation infrastructures instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The foundational "ground truth" paradigm in machine learning rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats legitimate human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review investigates how data annotation practices facilitate a "consensus trap" that marginalizes diverse perspectives and enforces Western norms through economic coercion.

Method: Systematic literature review of 30,897 records published 2020-2025 across seven premier venues (ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, NeurIPS). Used tiered keyword filtration to create a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records, manually screened to 346 final papers for qualitative synthesis via reflexive thematic analysis.

Result: Identified systemic failures in positional legibility and how human-as-verifier models create deep anchoring bias while removing human voices. Found geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, enforced by precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiqued the "noisy sensor" fallacy where cultural pluralism is misdiagnosed as random error.

Conclusion: The consensus trap fundamentally undermines culturally competent AI systems. The authors propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering singular "right" answers to mapping the diversity of human experience, reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building inclusive machine learning models.

Abstract: In machine learning, "ground truth" refers to the assumed correct labels used to train and evaluate models. However, the foundational "ground truth" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this "consensus trap". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the "noisy sensor" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular "right" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.

Motivation: 大型语言模型作为AI内容自动评判器已广泛应用，但与人类判断对齐仍具挑战。现有自动提示优化(APO)方法主要针对文本评估，多模态场景下研究不足，且多模态模型因上下文窗口限制无法处理足够视觉示例进行有效试错优化。

Method: 提出BLPO双向提示优化框架：1) 将图像转换为保留评估相关视觉线索的文本表示；2) 采用双向优化策略联合精炼评判提示和图像转文本(I2T)提示，在有限上下文预算下保持保真度。

Conclusion: BLPO成功解决了多模态LLM评判中的上下文窗口限制问题，通过文本化和联合优化策略实现了高效的多模态提示优化，为AI生成图像的评估提供了新方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted as automated judges for evaluating AI-generated content. Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Result: 跨多模型架构和参数量的大规模评估显示，智能体性能在不同噪声条件下存在显著波动。

Conclusion: 当前智能体模型对现实环境扰动高度敏感，强调需要建立更鲁棒的评估体系。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled LLM-based agents to achieve strong performance on a variety of benchmarks. However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.

TL;DR: BAO is a novel agentic RL framework that balances proactive behavior and user satisfaction by enhancing useful interactions while suppressing inefficient ones, achieving superior performance on multi-turn tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proactive LLM agents must balance task performance with user engagement, but existing RL pipelines struggle with this trade-off—passive agents can't adapt to user intentions while overusing human feedback reduces satisfaction.

Method: The authors propose BAO, combining behavior enhancement to improve proactive reasoning and information-gathering with behavior regularization to suppress redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations, evaluated on the UserRL benchmark suite.

Result: BAO substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines and matches or exceeds commercial LLM agents on multiple multi-turn tasks from the UserRL benchmark.

Conclusion: BAO demonstrates an effective approach for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios by successfully balancing task completion efficiency with user satisfaction.

Abstract: Proactive large language model (LLM) agents aim to actively plan, query, and interact over multiple turns, enabling efficient task completion beyond passive instruction following and making them essential for real-world, user-centric applications. Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出C-JEPA，一种面向对象的掩码联合嵌入预测世界模型，通过对象级掩码实现因果推理，在视觉问答和反事实推理上提升20%，并在规划任务中大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型需要强大的关系理解能力来支持预测、推理和控制，但现有的面向对象表征无法充分捕捉交互依赖的动态特性，缺乏对交互推理的建模能力。

Method: 提出C-JEPA，将图像块的掩码联合嵌入预测扩展到面向对象表征。通过对象级掩码，要求模型从其他对象推断被掩码对象的状态，从而诱导具有反事实效应的潜在干预，防止捷径解。

Result: 在视觉问答任务中，相比无对象级掩码的相同架构，反事实推理绝对提升约20%；在智能体控制任务中，仅需1%的潜在输入特征即可实现与基于图像块的世界模型相当的性能，规划效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 对象级掩码通过潜在干预引入因果归纳偏置，使C-JEPA能够有效建模对象间交互，提升反事实推理能力和规划效率，为构建更强大的世界模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

TL;DR: Proposes GHOST, a structured pruning framework for Mamba2 that reduces state dimension by 50% with minimal perplexity impact using only forward-pass statistics


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba2's large state dimension causes bandwidth saturation during autoregressive generation, but existing pruning methods fail: unstructured sparsity keeps dense activations, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods are too computationally expensive

Method: GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation) approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics by jointly measuring controllability and observability, avoiding backpropagation requirements

Result: Achieves 50% state-dimension reduction across 130M-2.7B parameter models with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2, matching gradient-based method fidelity

Conclusion: GHOST provides an efficient structured pruning approach that addresses Mamba2's inference bottleneck without gradient computation overhead

Abstract: While Mamba2's expanded state dimension enhances temporal modeling, it incurs substantial inference overhead that saturates bandwidth during autoregressive generation. Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods impose prohibitive costs. We introduce GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation), a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. By jointly measuring controllability and observability, GHOST rivals the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation. As a highlight, on models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, our approach achieves a 50\% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了复杂对话工具场景中不确定性的更早更准检测，为双控人机交互系统提供了有效的故障预警机制

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty for AI agents in real-world multi-turn tool-using interaction with humans is difficult because failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes (e.g., looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination) even when local generation appears confident. Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $τ^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合作式多智能体强化学习采用集中训练分散执行框架，依赖个体全局最大(IGM)原则，但在真实场景中因模拟到现实的差距、模型失配和系统噪声等环境不确定性导致可靠性不足。

Method: 引入DrIGM原则，要求每个智能体的鲁棒贪心动作与鲁棒团队最优联合动作一致；定义兼容分散贪心执行的鲁棒个体动作价值函数；基于此推导出遵循DrIGM的鲁棒价值分解架构变体，通过在鲁棒Q目标上训练，保持可扩展性并与现有代码库无缝集成。

Conclusion: DrIGM为多智能体系统提供了可证明的鲁棒性保证，在保持算法可扩展性和兼容性的同时，有效提升了真实不确定环境下的团队表现。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution, where value-factorization methods enforce the individual-global-maximum (IGM) principle so that decentralized greedy actions recover the team-optimal joint action. However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance.

*Zhengbo Jiao,Shaobo Wang,Zifan Zhang,Wei Wang,Bing Zhao,Hu Wei,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL) selectively reinforces high-connectivity visual anchor tokens in MLLMs, achieving 32B model performance surpassing 72B-Instruct on MathVista with only 1.2% overhead, revealing that reasoning quality depends on cross-modal anchoring fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RLVR has enhanced MLLM reasoning, the mechanism of how visual evidence integrates with language during reasoning remains poorly understood. The research aims to understand cross-modal integration through attention connectivity patterns.

Method: Analyzed cross-modal attention connectivity in multimodal RLVR, discovering only ~15% of tokens exhibit strong visual-textual coupling (anchors). Proposed AT-RL framework that uses graph-based clustering of attention topology to selectively reinforce these high-connectivity anchor tokens.

Result: AT-RL introduces minimal 1.2% overhead. The 32B model with AT-RL achieves 80.2 on MathVista, outperforming the 72B-Instruct baseline. Consistent improvements observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Training exclusively on low-connectivity tokens causes severe performance degradation.

Conclusion: Reasoning quality is governed by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring rather than token quantity. Effective multimodal RL depends on precise credit assignment to visual anchor tokens. The findings reveal that only a small subset of anchor tokens is crucial for successful visual grounding.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet how visual evidence is integrated during reasoning remains poorly understood. We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring.

### [185] [AgentLeak: A Full-Stack Benchmark for Privacy Leakage in Multi-Agent LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11510)
*Faouzi El Yagoubi,Ranwa Al Mallah,Godwin Badu-Marfo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentLeak, the first benchmark measuring privacy leakage in multi-agent LLM systems via internal channels (inter-agent messages, shared memory, tool arguments). Testing reveals multi-agent systems reduce output-channel leakage but increase total exposure to 68.9% due to unmonitored internal channels, with inter-agent communication being the primary vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy benchmarks for LLM systems only audit output channels, missing leakage through internal pathways like inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments in multi-agent coordination, creating unmeasured privacy risks.

Method: AgentLeak benchmark with 1,000 scenarios across 4 domains, 32-class attack taxonomy, and three-tier detection pipeline, tested on 5 major LLM models across 4,979 traces to measure leakage across five communication channels (C1-output to C5-internal channels).

Result: Multi-agent configurations reduce output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs single-agent 43.2%) but internal channels raise total exposure to 68.9%, with inter-agent messages (C2) leaking at 68.8%—41.7% of violations missed by output-only audits. Claude 3.5 Sonnet performs best (3.3% external, 28.1% internal leakage).

Conclusion: Multi-agent systems require coordination frameworks with internal-channel privacy protections and enforced privacy controls on inter-agent communication, as model-level safety training shows transfer benefits to internal channel protection.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.

Abstract: Learning internal reasoning processes is crucial for developing AI systems capable of sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.

Abstract: Causal inference holds immense value in fields such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences. However, traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers, requiring researchers to possess dual backgrounds in statistics and computer science, while manually selecting algorithms, handling data quality issues, and interpreting complex results. To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report. As a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm, CausalAgent explicitly models the analysis workflow. By leveraging interactive visualizations, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for causal analysis while ensuring the rigor and interpretability of the process.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ARC, a reinforcement learning system that dynamically optimizes LLM agent configurations per query, outperforming static templates with 25% higher accuracy while reducing token/runtime costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent configuration relies on fixed templates or hand-tuned heuristics, causing brittle performance and wasted compute by applying identical settings to both simple and complex queries.

Method: Formulates agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and proposes ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning policy that dynamically selects workflows, tools, and token budgets per input query.

Result: Across reasoning and tool-augmented QA benchmarks, ARC consistently surpasses hand-designed baselines with up to 25% higher task accuracy while reducing token usage and runtime costs.

Conclusion: Learning per-query configurations provides a superior alternative to "one size fits all" agent designs, demonstrating the value of dynamic adaptation for efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Configuring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from a large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A survey analyzing multi-agent communication through the Five Ws framework, tracing evolution from MARL to Emergent Language to LLMs, identifying trade-offs and design patterns for future hybrid systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent decision-making in partially observable environments requires communication to reduce uncertainty and enable collaboration, but research across MARL, Emergent Language, and LLM-based approaches remains fragmented without a unified analytical framework.

Method: Uses the Five Ws (who, whom, what, when, why) framework to systematically organize and connect communication research across three paradigms: MARL (hand-designed → end-to-end learned), Emergent Language (structured communication), and LLM-based systems (natural language priors).

Result: Distills key trade-offs: MARL protocols are task-specific and uninterpretable; EL struggles with grounding, generalization, and scalability; LLM systems offer open-ended collaboration but face new challenges. Identifies practical design patterns and open problems across all paradigms.

Conclusion: Future work should develop hybrid systems combining learning, language, and control to achieve scalable, interpretable multi-agent collaboration by integrating the strengths of MARL, Emergent Language, and LLM approaches.

Abstract: Multi-agent sequential decision-making powers many real-world systems, from autonomous vehicles and robotics to collaborative AI assistants. In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: MAPLE是一个模态感知的后训练框架，通过模态分层优化、自适应加权和课程学习，将单/多模态准确率差距缩小30.24%，收敛速度提升3.18倍，并在信号缺失时保持鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有RL后训练管道将所有输入模态视为同等重要，导致策略梯度方差大、收敛慢，且在真实世界信号缺失或重新加权时鲁棒性差。

Method: 作者提出MAPLE生态系统，包括：(1) MAPLE-bench基准，标注每个任务所需的最少信号组合；(2) MAPO框架，按模态需求分层批次以降低梯度方差；(3) 自适应加权和课程调度，平衡并优先处理更难的信号组合。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过实现模态感知，为可部署的多模态RL后训练提供了完整方案，这对真实世界的鲁棒性和效率至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal language models now integrate text, audio, and video for unified reasoning. Yet existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted. We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy. Adaptive weighting and curriculum focused learning further boost performance across signal combinations. MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training.

Abstract: We present scPilot, the first systematic framework to practice omics-native reasoning: a large language model (LLM) converses in natural language while directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and on-demand bioinformatics tools. scPilot converts core single-cell analyses, i.e., cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting, into step-by-step reasoning problems that the model must solve, justify, and, when needed, revise with new evidence.
  To measure progress, we release scBench, a suite of 9 expertly curated datasets and graders that faithfully evaluate the omics-native reasoning capability of scPilot w.r.t various LLMs. Experiments with o1 show that iterative omics-native reasoning lifts average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation and Gemini-2.5-Pro cuts trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting, while generating transparent reasoning traces explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic. By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses.

*Aman Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the non-deterministic behavior of LLM agents, finding that they produce inconsistent action sequences even with identical inputs, and this inconsistency strongly correlates with task failure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLM agents behave consistently when run multiple times on the same task, and whether behavioral variance can serve as an early indicator of failure to improve agent reliability.

Method: Conducted 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA using ReAct-style agents, measuring distinct action sequences and correlating behavioral consistency with task accuracy.

Result: Agents produced 2.0-4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs. Tasks with consistent behavior (≤2 paths) achieved 80-92% accuracy, while inconsistent tasks (≥6 paths) achieved only 25-60% (32-55 point gap). 69% of divergence occurred at the first search query.

Conclusion: Monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability, as variance strongly predicts failure and originates from early decisions.

Abstract: Run the same LLM agent on the same task twice: do you get the same behavior? We find the answer is often no. In a study of 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA, we observe that ReAct-style agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average, even with identical inputs. More importantly, this variance predicts failure: tasks with consistent behavior ($\leq$2 unique paths) achieve 80--92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks ($\geq$6 unique paths) achieve only 25--60%, a 32--55 percentage point gap depending on model. We trace variance to early decisions: 69% of divergence occurs at step 2, the first search query. Our results suggest that monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is fundamental to numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch. Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to a $\sim$35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

Motivation: 当前多模态大模型在感知任务上表现优异，但数学空间推理能力尚不明确。人类轻松解决教科书级空间推理问题的准确率超过95%，而大多数领先模型在同一任务上准确率甚至不到60%，这揭示了空间推理是当前模型的基本弱点。需要专门框架来评估和提升这一能力，并区分感知与推理的难度。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on perception-oriented tasks, yet their ability to perform mathematical spatial reasoning, defined as the capacity to parse and manipulate two- and three-dimensional relations, remains unclear. Humans easily solve textbook-style spatial reasoning problems with over 95\% accuracy, but we find that most leading MLLMs fail to reach even 60\% on the same tasks. This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\%. MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning for large language model alignment has progressed rapidly in recent years, transferring these paradigms to high-stakes medical question answering reveals a fundamental paradigm mismatch. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

TL;DR: 物理与数值知识上下文工程(PhyNiKCE)将神经规划与符号验证分离，用于可信的CFD仿真，性能较基线提升96%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在CFD应用中难以执行物理守恒定律和数值稳定性，纯语义检索增强生成(RAG)导致"上下文污染"，产生语言合理但物理无效的配置，存在语义-物理脱节问题。

Method: PhyNiKCE采用神经符号智能体框架，将神经规划与符号验证解耦。通过符号知识引擎将仿真设置视为约束满足问题，利用确定性RAG引擎专门检索求解器、湍流模型和边界条件，严格执物理约束。

Result: 在OpenFOAM实际CFD任务中，使用Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash验证显示，该框架较先进基线相对提升96%，自治自校正循环减少59%，LLM令牌消耗降低17%。

Conclusion: 将神经生成与符号约束执行解耦显著增强了鲁棒性和效率，为更广泛的工业自动化可信人工智能提供了可扩展、可审计的范式。

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is critically limited by the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle to enforce the strict conservation laws and numerical stability required for physics-based simulations. Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to "context poisoning," where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation.

TL;DR: 提出基准健康指数(BHI)框架，从能力区分度、抗饱和度和影响力三个维度量化评估大语言模型基准测试的健康状况，解决了当前基准分数通胀和选择性报告导致的可信度危机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型快速发展，但评测基准因分数通胀和选择性报告问题变得越来越不可靠，社区对哪些评测结果仍可信赖存在不确定性。

Method: 构建纯数据驱动的Benchmark Health Index (BHI)框架，从三个正交维度评估基准：能力区分度（区分模型真实性能）、抗饱和度（预测剩余提升空间）和影响力（量化生态影响）。通过分析2025年91个代表性模型的106个已验证基准的技术报告，系统刻画评测全景图。

Result: BHI是首个在宏观层面量化基准健康状况的框架，为基准选择提供了原则性依据。

Conclusion: BHI实现了新一代评测协议动态生命周期管理，帮助研究社区识别可靠基准并优化评测体系。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, yet the benchmarks used to measure this progress are becoming increasingly unreliable. Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.

### [198] [Right for the Wrong Reasons: Epistemic Regret Minimization for Causal Rung Collapse in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11675)
*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper identifies "Rung Collapse" - a fundamental failure in autoregressive training where models cannot distinguish correlation from causation, leading to "Aleatoric Entrenchment" where models become stuck using wrong causal reasoning. The authors propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision framework that penalizes flawed causal reasoning independent of task success, and prove it recovers true causal distributions with finite-sample bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems often achieve high performance through spurious shortcuts that fail under distributional shift, but the causal origin of this pathology remains unclear. Understanding why models become "right for the wrong reasons" and entrenched in flawed reasoning is critical for building robust, interpretable AI systems that generalize beyond training distributions.

Method: The authors introduce Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a causal belief revision objective embedded in a three-layer architecture: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions implementing actuator independence correspond to valid do-operations, connecting action languages with do-calculus; (2) ERM as a belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates to prevent entrenchment; and (3) a domain-independent failure mode taxonomy with guards to enable cross-domain transfer.

Result: Theoretical analysis proves asymptotic recovery of true interventional distributions with finite-sample bounds. Empirical evaluation across 1,360 causal trap scenarios and six frontier LLMs reveals that Rung Collapse persists in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), advanced models exhibit inverse scaling in steerability (resisting generic corrections), and targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where traditional outcome-level feedback fails completely.

Conclusion: Rung Collapse represents a fundamental limitation of autoregressive training that cannot be solved by scaling alone. ERM provides a principled solution by explicitly penalizing causal reasoning errors, but the inverse scaling of steerability suggests increasingly advanced models may become more resistant to correction, requiring architectural rather than just training interventions to ensure causal robustness.

Abstract: Machine learning systems that are "right for the wrong reasons" achieve high performance through shortcuts that collapse under distributional shift. We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.

TL;DR: MLLMs suffer from structural blindness in engineering schematics. The authors propose Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline to convert CAD diagrams into property graphs, achieving significant accuracy gains on electrical compliance checks compared to pixel-based MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics due to their pixel-driven paradigm that discards explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning.

Method: Proposes a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable.

Result: On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level.

Conclusion: The results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding, yet they suffer from a critical limitation: structural blindness. Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains.

*Xin Xu,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Haoliang Wang,Julian McAuley,Saayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkRouter是一种推理时的置信度感知路由机制，根据模型置信度动态地在离散token空间和潜在空间之间切换，以提升大语言模型的推理准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在推理虽能提升效率，但效果不稳定。分析发现错误答案的推理轨迹比正确答案包含更少的低置信度步骤，推测低置信度替代方案的软嵌入会引入噪声并传播，导致对不可靠推理轨迹产生过高置信度。

Method: 提出ThinkRouter路由机制：当模型置信度低时路由到离散token空间进行显式推理，置信度高时路由到潜在空间进行潜在推理。

Result: 在STEM推理和代码基准测试中，相比显式CoT、随机路由和潜在推理基线，ThinkRouter平均提升Pass@1达19.70分，生成长度减少最多15.55%，能校准两类方法的错误，并通过全局降低置信度加速结束推理token的生成。

Conclusion: ThinkRouter通过置信度感知的动态路由，有效结合了显式和潜在推理的优势，在保持效率的同时显著提升推理准确率。

Abstract: Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that uses reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure functional differences between large language models and selectively merges complementary parameters through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Unlike existing parameter-space heuristics that cause severe interference and unstable generation, SCF-RKL's mode-seeking design preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities, outperforming prior methods across 24 benchmarks while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods rely on parameter-space heuristics that introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs.

Method: Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL) - a novel framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. It measures functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters rather than assuming linear additivity in parameter space.

Result: Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, safety, and vision classification demonstrate that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability across various model scales and architectures.

Conclusion: The SCF-RKL framework effectively addresses interference in model merging by using a mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design that preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities, demonstrating consistent improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for composing the capabilities of large language models by directly operating in weight space, enabling the integration of specialized models without costly retraining. However, existing merging methods largely rely on parameter-space heuristics, which often introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs. In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

*Thomas Jiralerspong,Trenton Bricken*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs) for cross-architecture model diffing, enabling comparison of different model architectures. They discovered safety-critical behavioral differences including political alignment patterns and refusal mechanisms across major AI models like Qwen3, Llama3.1, and GPT-OSS-20B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model diffing currently only works for base vs finetune comparisons, but new LLM releases often feature novel architectures, limiting practical applicability. Cross-architecture methods are essential for widespread adoption.

Method: Introduced Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model, enabling unsupervised cross-architecture model diffing.

Result: Identified meaningful behavioral differences across models: Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B.

Conclusion: Cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing is established as an effective method for identifying safety-critical behavioral differences between AI models.

Abstract: Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. Together, our results work towards establishing cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.

TL;DR: 本文提出Text2GQL-Bench统一基准测试，解决现有文本转图查询语言数据集领域覆盖窄、查询语言支持少、评估维度单一的问题，揭示LLM在ISO-GQL生成中存在严重方言鸿沟（零样本执行准确率仅4%），证明微调可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本转图查询语言数据集在领域覆盖、支持的图查询语言和评估范围上存在局限，缺乏高质量基准和系统评估方法，阻碍了Text-to-GQL系统的跨语言和跨领域能力对比与发展。

Method: 构建包含178,184个(问题,查询)对的多GQL数据集，覆盖13个领域；设计可扩展框架生成异构资源下的多领域、多抽象级别、多GQL数据集；提出综合评估方法，联合报告语法有效性、相似性、语义对齐和执行准确率。

Result: 发现ISO-GQL生成存在显著方言鸿沟：强LLM零样本执行准确率(EX)最高仅4%，3样本提示提升至约50%但语法有效性仍<70%；微调8B开源模型达到45.1% EX和90.8%语法有效性，证明性能提升主要源于充足ISO-GQL示例。

Conclusion: Text2GQL-Bench为Text-to-GQL系统提供统一评估基准，揭示LLM在图查询语言生成中的关键瓶颈，强调领域特定语法示例对突破方言鸿沟的决定性作用，推动LLM作为图数据库管理系统的智能体基础设施发展。

Abstract: Graph models are fundamental to data analysis in domains rich with complex relationships. Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM智能体在各自主应用中正被广泛部署，但现有安全机制几乎只专注于预先防止故障，对事故发生后的响应、遏制和恢复能力有限。

Method: 提出AIR框架，定义用于管理LLM智能体系统事件响应生命周期的领域特定语言，并将其集成到智能体执行循环中，实现：(1)通过基于当前环境状态和近期上下文的语义检查检测事故；(2)指导智能体通过工具执行遏制和恢复操作；(3)在根除阶段合成护栏规则以阻止未来类似事故。

Result: 在三种代表性智能体类型上评估显示，AIR的检测、修复和根除成功率均超过90%。大量实验证实关键设计组件的必要性，展示AIR的及时性和适度开销，并证明LLM生成的规则在各领域可接近开发人员编写规则的效果。

Conclusion: 事件响应作为提升智能体安全性的第一类机制，既是可行的也是必不可少的。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in practice across a wide range of autonomous applications. Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety.

Conclusion: 将搜索机制从推理时移至训练回滚阶段，提供通用且互补的框架，显著提升多轮智能体学习效果，无需修改优化目标

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.

Conclusion: 两种方法为多物种SDM二值化提供稳健可复现的工具，特别提升稀有物种预测可靠性

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) commonly produce probabilistic occurrence predictions that must be converted into binary presence-absence maps for ecological inference and conservation planning. However, this binarization step is typically heuristic and can substantially distort estimates of species prevalence and community composition. We present MaxExp, a decision-driven binarization framework that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing a chosen evaluation metric. MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores. We also introduce the Set Size Expectation (SSE) method, a computationally efficient alternative that predicts assemblages based on expected species richness. Using three case studies spanning diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, we show that MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity. SSE offers a simpler yet competitive option. Together, these methods provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization.

Abstract: In online advertising, advertising text plays a critical role in attracting user engagement and driving advertiser value. Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.
  To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.
  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: 提出执行-总结（ES）框架，通过解耦任务执行与工作流构建，准确转化LLM推理为结构化工作流，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM能解决复杂任务但难以准确将其转化为结构化工作流；现有方法因执行与构建过程相互干扰而精度不足。

Method: 执行-总结（ES）框架：先完成任务执行，再从执行轨迹独立重建工作流；并构建FlowBench进行评估。

Result: 在FlowBench上的大量实验显示，该框架优于现有方法，提升了工作流的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 为将自由形式LLM推理转化为结构化工作流提供了可靠范式。

Abstract: LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

*Lingyong Yan,Jiulong Wu,Dong Xie,Weixian Shi,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAVES is a hierarchical multi-agent LLM system that generates instructional videos by decomposing the task into specialized agents (Solution, Illustration, Narration) coordinated by an Orchestrating Agent, achieving over 95% cost reduction and >1M videos/day throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end video generation models perform well for visually-oriented content but fail in scenarios requiring strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation (e.g., instructional/educational media), suffering from low procedural fidelity, high production costs, and limited controllability.

Method: LAVES decomposes video generation into specialized agents (Solution Agent for problem-solving, Illustration Agent for visualization code, Narration Agent for scripts) coordinated by an Orchestrating Agent with quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Instead of direct pixel synthesis, it creates structured executable scripts compiled deterministically into synchronized audiovisual output using template-driven assembly.

Result: The system achieves >1 million videos/day throughput, >95% cost reduction compared to industry standards, and maintains high acceptance rates while ensuring correct reasoning, pedagogical coherence, faithful visuals, and precise audio-visual alignment.

Conclusion: LAVES demonstrates that a hierarchical multi-agent approach with explicit quality control can automate high-quality instructional video production at scale, dramatically reducing costs while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.

*Hongbo Zhang,Yue Yang,Jianhao Yan,Guangsheng Bao,Yue Zhang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Min-$k$NN Distance，一种黑盒检测器，通过测量生成结果的多样性来识别RLVR训练数据污染。该方法利用RLVR训练导致生成更僵化、更相似的特性，在无需模型访问权限的情况下可靠区分已见和未见提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推理模型使用RLVR训练，但训练数据未公开引发基准污染担忧。与传统预训练不同，RLVR基于奖励反馈微调，使现有基于似然的检测方法失效。需要新方法来检测这种新型训练范式下的数据污染。

Method: Min-$k$NN Distance方法：对给定提示采样多个补全，计算它们之间k个最小最近邻编辑距离的平均值。该指标量化RLVR训练引起的生成多样性崩溃——训练中遇到的提示会产生更相似、更僵化的输出。完全黑盒，无需访问参考模型或token概率。

Result: 在多个RLVR训练的推理模型上实验表明，Min-$k$NN Distance能可靠区分RL训练已见和未见示例，且优于现有成员推理和RL污染检测基线方法。

Conclusion: RLVR训练会在模型行为中留下可检测的签名，表现为生成多样性降低。Min-$k$NN Distance是一种简单有效的黑盒检测工具，可解决RLVR场景下的基准污染检测难题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

*Pingjun Pan,Tingting Zhou,Peiyao Lu,Tingting Fei,Hongxiang Chen,Chuanjiang Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Hi-SAM框架解决多模态推荐中的两大挑战：语义标记化的纠缠问题和架构-数据不匹配。通过解耦语义标记器和分层记忆锚定Transformer，在真实数据集上超越SOTA基线，并在百万用户规模的社交平台上实现核心指标6.55%的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态推荐虽利用项目丰富属性，但现有语义ID方法存在两个问题：1) 次优标记化：缺乏跨模态共享语义与模态特定细节的解耦，导致冗余或坍缩；2) 架构-数据不匹配：Vanilla Transformer将语义ID视为扁平流，忽略用户交互、项目和标记的层次结构，项目扩展为多标记后放大长度和噪声，使注意力偏向局部细节而非整体语义。

Method: 提出Hi-SAM分层结构感知多模态框架，包含：1) 解耦语义标记器(DST)：通过几何感知对齐统一模态，采用粗到细量化策略，共享码本提炼共识，模态特定码本从残差中恢复细节，通过互信息最小化强制解耦；2) 分层记忆锚定Transformer(HMAT)：通过分层RoPE将位置编码拆分为项间和项内子空间以恢复层次，插入锚定标记将项目压缩为紧凑记忆，保留当前项目细节同时通过压缩摘要访问历史。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上相对于SOTA基线表现一致更优，尤其在冷启动场景下。在服务数百万用户的大规模社交平台上部署后，核心在线指标提升6.55%。

Conclusion: Hi-SAM通过创新的解耦标记化和分层Transformer设计，有效解决了多模态推荐中的关键挑战，在理论和实践上均取得显著成效，为工业级推荐系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

*Lianjun Wu,Shengchen Zhu,Yuxuan Liu,Liuyu Kai,Xiaoduan Feng,Duomin Wang,Wenshuo Liu,Jingxuan Zhang,Kelvin Li,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes PuYun-LDM, a latent diffusion model for weather forecasting that uses 3D-MAE to encode weather evolution and VA-MFM for variable-aware frequency regularization, achieving better short-term forecasts than traditional ensemble methods while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models suffer from limited diffusability in high-resolution weather forecasting due to the lack of meteorological foundation models and inter-variable spectral heterogeneity, making existing frequency-based regularization approaches ineffective.

Method: Proposes a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) to encode weather-state evolution as conditioning for diffusion, plus a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects frequency thresholds based on each variable's spectral energy distribution.

Result: Achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times and comparable performance at longer horizons; generates 15-day global forecasts with 6-hour resolution in 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU with efficient parallel ensemble generation.

Conclusion: PuYun-LDM successfully enhances latent diffusability for meteorological data, demonstrating both performance advantages over traditional ensemble methods and significant computational efficiency.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) suffer from limited diffusability in high-resolution (<=0.25°) ensemble weather forecasting, where diffusability characterizes how easily a latent data distribution can be modeled by a diffusion process. Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.

*Huanyi Xie,Yubin Chen,Liangyu Wang,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a lightweight framework for predicting sequence lengths in LLM inference by reusing internal hidden states, featuring Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP) for static prediction and Progressive Length Prediction (PLP) for stochastic generation, achieving 29.16% MAE reduction and significant throughput gains on a new benchmark ForeLen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The long-tailed distribution of sequence lengths in LLM serving and RL sampling causes significant computational waste due to excessive padding in batched inference, while existing auxiliary model-based methods incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic scenarios.

Method: A lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction, consisting of: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP) using on-the-fly activations and token entropy for static prediction; 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP) that dynamically estimates remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation.

Result: On the newly released ForeLen benchmark (long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data), EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with 29.16% MAE reduction over the best baseline, and integration with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains.

Conclusion: The work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference by enabling accurate length prediction with negligible overhead through model internal state reuse.

Abstract: The long-tailed distribution of sequence lengths in LLM serving and reinforcement learning (RL) sampling causes significant computational waste due to excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods rely on auxiliary models for static length prediction, but they incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios. We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\% over the best baseline. Integrating our methods with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains. Our work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: 提出原型Transformer(ProtoT)，用可解释的原型向量替代标准自注意力机制，实现线性计算复杂度并保持高性能，同时提供模型推理过程的可解释路径


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型虽性能强大但推理过程不透明，存在信任风险、幻觉和欺骗问题；标准Transformer的自注意力机制计算复杂度高（二次方）且缺乏可解释性

Method: 设计基于原型向量（parameter vectors）的自回归架构，通过输入序列与原型间的双向通信自动学习可命名概念（如"女人"），建立可解释的上下文信息聚合通道

Result: 1) 计算复杂度与序列长度呈线性关系（vs 标准Transformer的二次方） 2) 在GLUE等下游任务中接近SOTA性能 3) 原型自动捕获语义概念并提供推理路径 4) 对输入扰动具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: ProtoT在保持高性能的同时实现了设计可解释性，为构建可解释的自回归语言模型提供了新方向，平衡了性能与透明度需求

Abstract: While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. "woman") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.

Conclusion: 该方法有效弥补了动态地图的自然语言交互短板，验证了规则与常识知识协同机制的可行性，具备强泛化能力和实用潜力，但需平衡模型规模与响应效率

Abstract: Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器(SAE)独立提取LLM特征，忽略了语言内在的层次结构。特征分裂现象表明LLM表征具有层次性，需要建模特征间的父子关系。

Method: 提出分层稀疏自编码器(HSAE)，联合训练多级SAE并学习特征间的父子关系；采用结构约束损失强化层次对齐，引入随机特征扰动机制增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个LLM和层上验证：HSAE能持续恢复语义意义明确的层次结构，定量定性指标均支持；同时保持重建保真度和可解释性，不受字典大小影响。

Conclusion: 提供了可扩展的工具，用于发现和分析嵌入在LLM表征中的多尺度概念结构，深化了对语言模型内部组织方式的理解。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven effective for extracting monosemantic features from large language models (LLMs), yet these features are typically identified in isolation. However, broad evidence suggests that LLMs capture the intrinsic structure of natural language, where the phenomenon of "feature splitting" in particular indicates that such structure is hierarchical. To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes. Our work provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing the multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations.

Motivation: 大语言模型存在事实错误，限制其在高风险场景的应用。现有的基于不确定性的二值回避策略在长文本场景过于严格，常常丢弃有价值信息。

Method: 作者通过选择性风险和覆盖度指标形式化SA框架，并提出原子级选择性抽象方法：将回复分解为原子声明，用置信度更高但更泛化的抽象替换不确定的原子声明。

Result: 在FactScore和LongFact-Objects基准测试中，六个开源模型上的原子级SA持续优于现有基线，相比声明删除方法将风险-覆盖度曲线下面积（AURC）提升最高达27.73%。

Conclusion: 降低不确定内容的细节程度可以在保留大部分原始含义的同时提升准确性和可靠性，为二值回避提供了更好的替代方案。

Abstract: LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary "all-or-nothing" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.

TL;DR: AlphaPROBE is a DAG-based framework for alpha factor mining that uses Bayesian retrieval and graph-aware generation to outperform existing methods on Chinese stock market data by leveraging global evolutionary topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alpha factor mining methods (Decoupled Factor Generation and Iterative Factor Evolution) lack a global structural view, treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which causes redundant search and limited diversity.

Method: Reframes alpha mining as navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges. Core components: (1) Bayesian Factor Retriever uses posterior probability to identify high-potential seeds while balancing exploitation/exploration; (2) DAG-aware Factor Generator leverages full ancestral traces for context-aware, nonredundant optimizations.

Result: Significantly outperformed 8 competitive baselines on three major Chinese stock market datasets, demonstrating enhanced predictive accuracy, return stability, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: Leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery in quantitative finance.

Abstract: Extracting signals through alpha factor mining is a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance. Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency. Our results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery.

TL;DR: 本文提出MEME框架，通过建模金融市场为竞争性投资叙事生态系统的演化过程，实现了比现有资产中心或市场中心方法更优的投资组合表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的量化金融方法要么侧重于个股预测（资产中心范式），要么侧重于投资组合配置（市场中心范式），但都忽视了驱动市场波动的底层逻辑和投资叙事，导致策略缺乏稳健的推理基础。

Method: 提出MEME框架，采用多智能体提取模块将噪声数据转化为高质量投资论点，利用高斯混合模型在语义空间中挖掘潜在共识，并通过时序评估与对齐机制追踪投资叙事的生命周期和历史盈利能力，从而实现对演化逻辑的建模。

Conclusion: MEME通过优先选择持久的市场智慧而非短暂异常，确保了投资组合构建基于稳健推理，为量化金融提供了一种新的逻辑导向研究范式。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in quantitative finance by processing vast unstructured data to emulate human-like analytical workflows. However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

TL;DR: Proposes CSEval framework using language models to evaluate clinical semantic alignment in medical text-to-image generation, addressing gaps in existing realism/diversity metrics


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for medical text-to-image generation only assess realism/diversity but fail to verify critical clinical semantics (anatomical location, pathology), risking unreliable medical AI applications

Method: Develops Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval) framework that leverages language models to measure semantic alignment between generated medical images and text prompts

Result: CSEval detects semantic inconsistencies missed by other metrics and shows strong correlation with clinical expert judgments

Conclusion: Provides scalable, clinically meaningful evaluation complement to ensure safe adoption of generative AI in healthcare by verifying medical accuracy

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has been increasingly applied in medical domains for various purposes such as data augmentation and education. Evaluating the quality and clinical reliability of these generated images is essential. However, existing methods mainly assess image realism or diversity, while failing to capture whether the generated images reflect the intended clinical semantics, such as anatomical location and pathology. In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文从行为模式角度研究LLM推理，提出InjectCorrect和InjectRLOpt两种无需参数更新的优化方法，通过注入自适应推理行为模式，性能最高提升8.67%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽利用行为提示增强推理能力，但多为直觉性设计，缺乏对模型底层行为模式的系统性分析。

Method: 通过观察模型对特定问题类型的自适应推理行为分布，提出InjectCorrect（模仿自身历史正确答案的行为模式）和InjectRLOpt（从历史数据学习价值函数，通过可靠性感知Softmax策略在推理时生成行为注入）两种方法。

Result: 实验表明，两种方法在不修改模型参数的前提下，可提升各类推理任务性能，分别取得5.34%和8.67%的最大增益。

Conclusion: 结构化注入自适应推理行为模式是一种有效的参数无关LLM推理增强策略。

Abstract: Reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models. While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出DTAPP-IICR方法，用于解决大型无人机机群在动态共享空域中的飞行前规划问题。该方法通过时间感知的优先级规划、新型4D单智能体路径规划器SFIPP-ST以及迭代冲突消解机制，成功实现了千架级无人机在复杂时空禁飞区约束下的高效协同，相比现有方法在运行时间和可扩展性方面都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型无人机机群在动态共享空域中的飞行前规划面临多重挑战：时空禁飞区(NFZs)、异构无人机性能差异、严格的交付期限等。虽然多智能体路径规划(MAPF)提供了理论框架，但现有方法在可扩展性和灵活性方面难以满足实际无人交通管理(UTM)需求。

Method: 提出DTAPP-IICR框架：1)基于任务紧急程度进行优先级排序生成初始解；2)采用新型4D单智能体规划器SFIPP-ST计算机群往返轨迹，处理异构无人机、强制时空禁飞区约束并将智能体间冲突建模为软约束；3)通过几何冲突图引导的迭代大规模邻域搜索解决剩余冲突；4)使用保完备性的方向剪枝技术加速三维搜索。

Result: 在含时空禁飞区的基准测试中，DTAPP-IICR对1000架无人机规模实现近100%成功率，剪枝技术带来高达50%的运行时间缩减，在UTM场景下性能优于批量增强型基于冲突的搜索方法。在城市级实际运营中扩展性显著优于其他优先级方法。

Conclusion: DTAPP-IICR为密集动态城市空域中的飞行前规划提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够有效处理大规模异构无人机机群的复杂约束和冲突消解问题。

Abstract: Preflight planning for large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleets in dynamic, shared airspace presents significant challenges, including temporal No-Fly Zones (NFZs), heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines. While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LawThinker是一个自主法律研究智能体，采用探索-验证-记忆策略，在每个推理步骤后强制验证，防止错误传播，在动态法律基准测试中比基线方法提升24%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律推理方法缺乏对中间步骤的验证机制，导致不适当的法律条文引用等错误在推理链中未被检测地传播，无法同时保证结果正确性和程序合规性。

Method: 提出LawThinker智能体，采用Explore-Verify-Memorize策略：DeepVerifier模块从知识准确性、事实-法律相关性和程序合规性三个维度检查每个检索结果；记忆模块实现长序列任务中的知识跨轮次复用。

Result: 在动态基准J1-EVAL上，相比直接推理提升24%，比基于工作流的方法提升11%，在过程导向指标上提升尤为显著；在三个静态基准上验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将验证作为每个探索步骤后的原子操作，LawThinker有效解决了法律推理中的验证缺口，在动态司法环境中展现出显著的性能优势和泛化能力。

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/yxy-919/LawThinker-agent .

TL;DR: 提出StateLM，一种能主动管理自身状态和记忆的基础模型，通过内部推理循环和记忆工具，在长文档QA、聊天记忆和深度研究任务上显著优于标准大模型，将大模型从被动预测器转变为状态感知智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型虽然有成熟数据库和检索系统，但缺乏主动操作记忆的"魔杖"，只能被动接受手动设计的上下文，受限于固定窗口架构，无法自主管理记忆状态。

Method: 引入StateLM模型，赋予其内部推理循环来管理自身状态，配备上下文剪枝、文档索引、笔记等记忆工具，训练模型主动管理这些工具并动态设计自己的上下文。

Result: 在各种模型规模上，StateLM在长文档QA任务上持续优于标准大模型；聊天记忆任务绝对准确率提升10-20%；在BrowseComp-Plus深度研究任务上达到52%准确率，而标准大模型仅约5%。

Conclusion: 将大模型从被动预测器转变为状态感知智能体，使推理成为有状态且可管理的过程，突破了固定窗口的架构限制。

Abstract: In the world of Harry Potter, when Dumbledore's mind is overburdened, he extracts memories into a Pensieve to be revisited later. In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the "wand" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%. Ultimately, our approach shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process.

TL;DR: ARLCP: 通过自适应反射惩罚和长度惩罚的强化学习框架，在保持关键推理的同时抑制不必要的反思步骤，根据问题复杂度动态协调生成更简洁有效的推理路径，实现效率与准确性的最佳平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务中会产生过长的思维链，包含大量重复自我质疑和循环推理等不必要反思，导致高令牌消耗、计算开销和延迟，却未提升准确性，且问题复杂度加剧这一问题

Method: 提出自适应反射与长度协调惩罚(ARLCP)强化学习框架，包含两个核心创新：1)自适应反射惩罚，在保留必要推理的同时抑制不必要反思步骤；2)基于问题复杂度校准的长度惩罚，二者协同鼓励模型生成更简洁有效的推理路径

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试上，与现有方法相比实现更优的效率-准确性权衡：1.5B模型平均响应长度减少53.1%且准确率提升5.8%；7B模型长度减少35.0%且准确率提升2.7%

Conclusion: ARLCP框架通过动态协调反射与长度惩罚，有效解决了过度反思导致的效率低下问题，在小型模型上尤其显著，为推理模型的实际部署提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by employing test-time scaling. However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP .

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The attention mechanism is an important reason for the success of transformers. It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.
  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.

*Roberto Balestri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This audit reveals that two major AI image generators (Gemini and GPT Image) exhibit severe demographic bias: >96% of outputs defaulted to white individuals despite neutral prompts, with Gemini favoring women and GPT favoring lighter-skinned men.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs from AI image generators, and to challenge the sociolinguistic belief that unmarked language produces inclusive representation.

Method: Generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts, analyzed with a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification across Monk, PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales.

Result: Both models showed extreme "default white" bias (>96% of outputs) but diverged on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. Neutral prompts functioned as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and demonstrates that neutral language does not produce inclusive representation, revealing systemic bias in state-of-the-art image generation models.

Abstract: This study quantifies gender and skin-tone bias in two widely deployed commercial image generators - Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (NanoBanana) and GPT Image 1.5 - to test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs. We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

*Jiajun Chen,Hua Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Value Alignment Tax (VAT) to measure how alignment interventions in LLMs cause unintended value changes across interconnected values, revealing systemic risks invisible to traditional target-only evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing value alignment research treats value relations as static, failing to capture how interventions like prompting or fine-tuning dynamically reshape broader value systems and cause ripple effects across values.

Method: The authors develop a controlled scenario-action dataset based on Schwartz value theory, collecting paired pre-post normative judgments to analyze alignment effects across different models, values, and alignment strategies.

Result: Their findings show that alignment interventions cause uneven, structured co-movement among values, with systemic effects that cannot be detected by conventional target-only evaluation methods.

Conclusion: The VAT framework reveals process-level alignment risks and provides new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs, suggesting we need to evaluate alignment beyond just target value achievement.

Abstract: Existing work on value alignment typically characterizes value relations statically, ignoring how interventions - such as prompting, fine-tuning, or preference optimization - reshape the broader value system. We introduce the Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework that measures how alignment-induced changes propagate across interconnected values relative to achieved on-target gain. VAT captures the dynamics of value expression under alignment pressure. Using a controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, we collect paired pre-post normative judgments and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies. Our results show that alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing systemic, process-level alignment risks and offering new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs.

Motivation: 全面大模型评估成本过高，现有统计方法面临模式漂移、数据稀疏和缺乏解释性问题，纯LLM方法可靠性不足。

Method: STAR框架：1) 用专业检索器获取外部知识，将语义特征嵌入约束概率矩阵分解(CPMF)生成带不确定性的统计期望；2) 基于期望违背理论(EVT)的推理模块，通过模型族内分析、跨模型比较和可信度感知聚合进行预测优化。

Result: 在极端稀疏场景下（每个测试模型仅1-2个观测分数），STAR在各项指标上持续优于所有基线，总分比最强统计方法提升14.46%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了小样本下的模型性能预测问题，兼具统计严谨性和LLM推理能力，提供可追溯的解释。

Abstract: As comprehensive large model evaluation becomes prohibitively expensive, predicting model performance from limited observations has become essential. However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty. A reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) then refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation, producing adjustments with traceable explanations. Extensive experiments show that STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity, with only 1--2 observed scores per test model.

Conclusion: 该方法为无损压缩提供新范式，通过利用语言模型潜在信息实现高效通用压缩，推动跨领域实用化压缩方案发展

Abstract: Efficient lossless compression is essential for minimizing storage costs and transmission overhead while preserving data integrity. Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.

Motivation: 先前研究仅通过基准测试评估大语言模型的社会任务表现，但未能检验心智理论的核心——即对心理状态与行为因果关系的内在表征。本研究旨在填补这一空白，测试大语言模型是否具备连贯、领域通用且一致的心理状态因果模型。

Method: 采用认知科学基础的心智理论定义，开发新的评估框架，通过逻辑等价的不同任务探针大语言模型是否具有领域通用、一致的心理状态-行为因果模型，并检验其行为预测与心理状态推断之间的内部一致性。

Result: 大语言模型在简单心智理论范式中表现良好，但在逻辑等价任务中失败，且行为预测与相应心理状态推断之间一致性较低。

Conclusion: 大语言模型表现出的社交能力并非源于领域通用或一致的心智理论，而是可能依赖表面模式匹配而非真正的心理状态建模。

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, and co-evolving paradigms have shown promising results in domains such as code and math. However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

*Greg Coppola*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends Quantified Boolean Bayesian Networks with negation and backward reasoning, and integrates a typed slot grammar for natural language parsing, creating a hybrid LLM-grammar system that enables complete logical inference from text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous QBBN work lacked negation/backward reasoning capabilities and natural language parsing, limiting its practical application for language understanding and logical inference.

Method: Extends QBBN with NEG factors for probabilistic negation; designs a typed logical language with three expressiveness tiers; develops a deterministic typed slot grammar; employs a hybrid architecture (LLM preprocessing, grammar parsing, LLM reranking, QBBN inference).

Result: Achieves perfect 44/44 inference on 22 reasoning patterns; perfect 33/33 parsing with zero ambiguity; LLMs show 95% disambiguation accuracy but only 12.4% parsing accuracy alone, proving grammar necessity.

Conclusion: Successfully reconciles formal semantics with modern ML by using LLMs as annotators to overcome the annotation bottleneck while using QBBN as verifier for structured reasoning, combining strengths of both paradigms.

Abstract: In previous work (Coppola, 2024) we introduced the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), a logical graphical model that implements the forward fragment of natural deduction (Prawitz, 1965) as a probabilistic factor graph. That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.
  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.
  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier. Code: https://github.com/gregorycoppola/world

TL;DR: Proposes IOA, a pedagogically-inspired three-stage framework for LLM knowledge distillation that applies Bloom's and Vygotsky's educational principles to systematically transfer knowledge from large to small models, achieving 94.7% teacher performance retention with 10x parameter reduction and significant improvements on reasoning tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge distillation methods lack pedagogical awareness, treating the process as a one-off data synthesis task rather than a systematic learning process, which limits effectiveness especially for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: A three-stage IOA (Identifier, Organizer, Adapter) pipeline that identifies student model knowledge deficiencies, organizes progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match student capacity. Integrates Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development for dynamic, gradual knowledge delivery.

Result: Experiments with LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 student models show IOA achieves 94.7% teacher performance on DollyEval with less than 1/10th parameters, plus 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The pedagogically-inspired IOA framework demonstrates that incorporating educational principles into knowledge distillation significantly improves performance, particularly for complex reasoning, offering an efficient approach for deploying capable smaller models.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 针对视觉语言分割模型中文本编码器过度配置的问题，通过大规模提示词分析发现严重冗余，提出轻量级SAM3-LiteText框架，用知识蒸馏优化的MobileCLIP学生模型替代原编码器，实现参数减少88%且性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言分割模型（如SAM3）使用为开放式语言理解设计的大型通用文本编码器，但实际分割提示词简短、结构化且语义受限，导致文本编码器能力严重过剩，带来不必要的计算和内存开销。

Method: 首先对404,796个真实提示词进行大规模解剖学分析，揭示文本提示中的冗余现象（上下文窗口利用率低、词汇使用稀疏、文本嵌入位于低维流形）；随后提出SAM3-LiteText，用知识蒸馏优化的紧凑MobileCLIP学生模型替代原SAM3文本编码器。

Result: 在图像和视频分割基准测试中，SAM3-LiteText将文本编码器参数减少高达88%，显著降低静态内存占用，同时保持与原始模型相当的细分性能。

Conclusion: 通过针对性优化文本编码器结构，可在几乎不损失性能的前提下大幅降低视觉语言分割模型的资源消耗，为高效部署提供新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language segmentation models such as SAM3 enable flexible, prompt-driven visual grounding, but inherit large, general-purpose text encoders originally designed for open-ended language understanding. In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

Abstract: Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.

Abstract: Explaining observed phenomena through symbolic, interpretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

TL;DR: CM2 is an RL framework that replaces verifiable rewards with checklist rewards for multi-turn tool-using agents, training in LLM-simulated environments to achieve significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying reinforcement learning to multi-turn agentic tool use is challenging due to lack of verifiable rewards for open-ended behaviors, underexplored research area, and high cost of building executable tool environments.

Method: CM2 decomposes behaviors into fine-grained binary criteria with evidence grounding, using sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation. Training occurs in scalable LLM-simulated tool environments to avoid heavy engineering.

Result: Starting from an 8B Base model with 8k RL examples, CM2 improves over SFT by 8 points on tau^-Bench, 10 points on BFCL-V4, and 12 points on ToolSandbox, matching or outperforming similarly sized open-source baselines.

Conclusion: CM2 provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

TL;DR: 提出CATTS方法，利用投票分布的不确定性统计量动态分配测试时计算资源，仅在决策真正有争议时增加计算量，在网页智能体任务上实现比均匀缩放高9.1%的性能，同时减少2.3倍token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放能提升模型性能，但在多步智能体任务中，小误差会累积且均匀增加采样策略收益递减。缺乏对计算资源进行智能分配以应对长期 horizon 环境挑战的理解。

Method: CATTS（置信度感知测试时缩放）通过分析智能体投票分布的熵和 top-1/top-2 差距等不确定性统计量，识别有争议决策，并仅在这些时刻动态分配额外计算资源，而非均匀缩放。

Result: 在 WebArena-Lite 和 GoBrowse 基准上，相比 React 基线性能提升最高达 9.1%，比均匀缩放少用 2.3 倍 token。研究表明不确定性指标与任务成功相关，且优于简单投票策略。

Conclusion: 基于置信度的动态计算分配策略比均匀缩放更高效，为多步智能体任务提供了可解释且有效的测试时缩放规则。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.
