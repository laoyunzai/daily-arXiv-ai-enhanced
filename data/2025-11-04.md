Abstract: A discrete-time totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on a lattice with
open boundaries is considered. There are particles of different types. The type
of a particle is characterized by the probability that a particle moves to a
vacant site and the probability that a particle occupying the rightmost site
departs the system. An approximate approach to compute the particle flow rate
and density in sites is proposed. A version of the approach is proposed for an
analogous continuous-time process. The accuracy of the approximation is
estimated. The approach can be used in traffic models and models of statistical
physics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A vertex cover on a graph is a set of vertices in which each edge of the
graph is adjacent to at least one vertex in the set. The Minimal Vertex Cover
(MVC) Problem concerns finding vertex covers with a smallest cardinality. The
MVC problem is a typical computationally hard problem among combinatorial
optimization on graphs, for which both developing fast algorithms to find
solution configurations on graph instances and constructing an analytical
theory to estimate their ground-state properties prove to be difficult tasks.
Here, by considering the long-range frustration (LRF) among MVC configurations
and formulating it into a theoretical framework of a percolation model, we
analytically estimate the energy density of MVCs on sparse random graphs only
with their degree distributions. We test our framework on some typical random
graph models. We show that, when there is a percolation of LRF effect in a
graph, our predictions of energy densities are slightly higher than those from
a hybrid algorithm of greedy leaf removal (GLR) procedure and survey
propagation-guided decimation algorithm on graph instances, and there are still
clearly closer to the results from the hybrid algorithm than an analytical
theory based on GLR procedure, which ignores LRF effect and underestimates
energy densities. Our results show that LRF is a proper mechanism in the
formation of complex energy landscape of MVC problem and a theoretical
framework of LRF helps to characterize its ground-state properties.

Abstract: This study investigates the mechanical origin of the arrow of time by
analyzing a one-dimensional three-particle system with elastic collisions. By
mapping the system to a contact between finite heat baths through a thermal
wall, we show that the energy exchange follows an exponential relaxation law,
even though the underlying equations of motion are time-reversal symmetric. The
loss of time-reversal symmetry emerges from the coarse-graining of dynamical
variables, specifically the omission of velocity signs in energy
representation. This result suggests that the arrow of time originates from
information reduction in the transition from microscopic to macroscopic
descriptions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The first-passage time is a key concept in stochastic modeling, representing
the time at which a process first reaches a specified threshold. In this work,
we consider a jump-diffusion (JD) model with a time-dependent threshold,
providing a more flexible framework for describing stochastic dynamics. We are
interested in the Exact simulation method developed for JD processes with
constant thresholds, where the Exact method for pure diffusion is applied
between jump intervals. An adaptation of this method to time-dependent
thresholds has recently been proposed for a more general stochastic setting. We
show that this adaptation can be applied to JD models by establishing a formal
correspondence between the two frameworks. A comparative analysis is then
performed between the proposed approach and the constant-threshold version in
terms of algorithmic structure and computational efficiency. Finally, we show
the applicability of the method by predicting neuronal spike times in a JD
model driven by two independent Poisson jump mechanisms.

Abstract: In this paper the exact solution and correlation functions for a double-chain
Ising model with multi-spin interactions and symmetric Hamiltonian density are
obtained. The study employs the transfer matrix method to derive fundamental
thermodynamic characteristics of the system. The main results include exact
expressions for the partition function, free energy, internal energy, specific
heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and entropy in a strip of finite
length and in the thermodynamic limit. The work provides explicit formulas for
the eigenvalues and shows structure of eigenvectors of the transfer matrix. The
expression for magnetization in the thermodynamic limit using components of
normalized eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue is obtained. A
detailed analysis is conducted for a special case of interactions involving all
kinds of two- and four-spin interactions. This gives the simplified formula for
free energy, it is calculated using the root of quadratic equation. The
research reveals properties of the system, including specific features of
ground states and phase diagram characteristics. Particular attention is given
to the behavior of physical quantities near frustration points and the
investigation of spin correlation functions. Plots of physical characteristics,
including inverse correlation length, illustrating the obtained results are
constructed.

Abstract: Short-time dynamics in the $2D$ Blume-Capel model, with a non-conserved
order-parameter and short-ranged interactions, is analysed. For non-equilibrium
dynamics, both at a critical point in the $2D$ Ising universality class and at
the tricritical point, we reproduce the values $\Theta=0.190({5})$ and
$\Theta=-0.542({5})$, respectively, of the critical initial slip exponent.
These agree with more early estimates and with the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann
scaling relation. In phase-ordering kinetics, after a quench into the ordered
phase, we establish the validity of short-time dynamics. In the $2D$ Ising
universality class, we find $\Theta=0.39({1})$ in agreement with the scaling
relation $\lambda=d-2\Theta$.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Boltzmann distribution connects the energetics of an equilibrium system
with its statistical properties, and it is desirable to have a similar
principle for non-equilibrium systems. Here, we derive a variational principle
for the entropy production rate (EPR) of far-from-equilibrium discrete state
systems, relating it to the action for the transition probability measure of
discrete state processes. This principle leads to a tighter, non-quadratic
formulation of the dissipation function, speed limits, the
thermodynamic-kinetic uncertainty relation, the large deviation rate
functional, and the fluctuation relation, all within a unified framework of the
thermodynamic length. Additionally, the optimal control of non-conservative
transition affinities using the underlying geodesic structure is explored, and
the corresponding slow-driving and finite-time optimal driving exact protocols
are analytically computed. We demonstrate that discontinuous endpoint jumps in
optimal protocols are a generic, model-independent physical mechanism that
reduces entropy production during finite-time driving of far-from-equilibrium
systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Boltzmann distribution for an equilibrium system constrains the
statistics of the system by the energetics. Despite the non-equilibrium
generalization of the Boltzmann distribution being studied extensively, a
unified framework valid for far-from-equilibrium discrete state systems is
lacking. Here, we derive an exact path-integral representation for discrete
state processes and represent it using the exponential of the action for
stochastic transition dynamics. Solving the variational problem, the effective
action is shown to be equal to the inferred entropy production rate (a
thermodynamic quantity) and a non-quadratic dissipation function of the
thermodynamic length (TL) defined for microscopic stochastic currents (a
dynamic quantity). This formulates a far-from-equilibrium analog of the
Boltzmann distribution, namely, the minimum action principle. The non-quadratic
dissipation function is physically attributed to incorporating non-Gaussian
fluctuations or far-from-equilibrium non-conservative driving. Further, an
exact large deviation dynamical rate functional is derived. The equivalence of
the variational formulation with the information geometric formulation is
proved. The non-quadratic TL recovers the non-quadratic thermodynamic-kinetic
uncertainty relation (TKUR) and the speed limits, which are tighter than the
close-to-equilibrium quadratic formulations. Moreover, if the transition
affinities are known, the non-quadratic TL recovers the fluctuation relation
(FR). The minimum action principle manifests the non-quadratic TKUR and FR as
two faces corresponding to the thermodynamic inference and partial control
descriptions, respectively. In addition, the validity of these results is
extended to coarse-grained observable currents, strengthening the
experimental/numerical applicability of them.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics are a frontier for
understanding the control and design of non-equilibrium systems, with broad
practical applications in biology, chemistry, and nanoscale/mesoscale systems.
Optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry have emerged as
optimal control methodology, but they are based on slow-driving and close to
equilibrium assumptions. An optimal control framework in stochastic
thermodynamics for finite time driving is still elusive. Therefore, we solve in
this paper an optimal control problem for changing the control parameters of a
discrete-state far-from-equilibrium process from an initial to a final value in
finite-time. Optimal driving protocols are derived that minimize the total
finite-time dissipation cost for the driving process. Our framework reveals
that discontinuous endpoint jumps are a generic, model-independent physical
mechanism that minimizes the optimal driving entropy production, whose
importance is further amplified for far-from-equilibrium systems. The
thermodynamic and dynamic physical interpretation and understanding of
discontinuous endpoint jumps is formulated. An exact mapping between the
finite-time to slow driving optimal control formulation is elucidated,
developing the state-of-the-art of optimal mass transport theory and
thermodynamic geometry, which has been the current paradigm for studying
optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics that relies on slow driving
assumptions. Our framework opens up a plethora of applications to the
thermodynamically efficient control of a far-from-equilibrium system in
finite-time, which opens up a way to their efficient design principles.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We consider interacting paraparticle chains with a constant $R$-matrix where
the Hamiltonian sums over the internal degrees (flavors) of the paraparticles.
For such flavor-blind Hamiltonians we show a general factorization of the
Hilbert space into occupation and flavor parts with the Hamiltonian acting
non-trivially only on the former. For open boundaries, the spectrum therefore
coincides with that of the occupation Hamiltonian $H_{\rm occ}$ with the flavor
part merely adding degeneracies. For periodic boundaries, a cyclic reordering
of the flavors leads to a separation of $H_{\rm occ}$ into flux sectors at
fixed particle number, thus making the parastatistics directly observable in
the energy spectrum. For important exemplary cases, $H_{\rm occ}$ reduces to
the XXZ chain with flux allowing for an exact solution. In the gapless regime,
this solution shows flux-shifted $c=1$ conformal towers in the low-energy
spectrum and a temperature-dependent chemical potential in the bulk
thermodynamics.

Abstract: We study explosive connectivity and mechanical rigidity in three-dimensional
cubic lattice structures under Achlioptas-type product-rule dynamics. Our work
combines extensive numerical simulation with the development of a new
theoretical framework. For connectivity, we rigorously establish the presence
of sublinear-width merger-cascade windows for $k\ge 2$, which drive macroscopic
jumps in the order parameter and imply a first-order transition. For rigidity,
we discover numerically that for richly-connected hosts, increasing the number
of choices $k$ monotonically enhances the efficiency of rigidification. To
explain this phenomenon, we propose a theoretical model centered on a
conditional progress function that links an edge's local product-rule score to
its global mechanical utility. We show that this function becomes
non-increasing, thus explaining the observed monotonic efficiency, under two
physically-motivated assumptions. Altogether, our work provides new insights
into the relationship between local dynamics and global connectivity and
rigidity in cubic lattice structures via both theory and computation.

Abstract: This work examines the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model in a
longitudinal magnetic field, comparing open-chain and closed-ring geometries.
At the nontrivial quantum critical point (QCP) $B_{\mathrm{crit}} = B/J = 2$,
we perform a microcanonical analysis of the ground-state manifold and
explicitly count the number of degenerate configurations. The enumeration
reveals that ground states follow the $N$th Fibonacci sequence for open chains
and the $N$th Lucas sequence for periodic rings, establishing a clear
correspondence between critical degeneracy, topology, and the golden ratio.
This combinatorial duality exposes a number-theoretic structure underlying
quantum criticality and highlights the role of topological constraints in
shaping residual entropy. Beyond its conceptual relevance, the result provides
a compact framework for analyzing degeneracy scaling in one-dimensional spin
systems and may inform future studies of critical phenomena and quantum
thermodynamic devices operating near critical regimes.

Abstract: Within the family of cubic YbCu$_4$X compounds ($X$ = Ni, Au and Zn), we have
investigated the YbCu$_{5-x}$Zn$_x$ ($1\geq x \geq 0.7$) alloys by means of
structural, magnetic, thermal and transport measurements. In the $\tau 1-$
YbCu$_{5-x}$Zn$_x$ (cubic AuBe$_5$ type, $0.7 \leq x \leq 1.5$) structural
phase, Yb ion is in its Yb$^{3+}$ magnetic configuration. However, by
increasing Zn content the unit cell grows faster than a reference computed as a
Cu by Zn atoms substitution, which indicates a shift of Yb ions towards the
larger Yb$^{2+}$ configuration. The magnetic behavior confirms such tendency
with a clear decrease of the saturation magnetization and effective moment
between $x=0.7$ and $x=1$. The specific heat at low temperature shows a
logarithmic dependence characteristic for a non-fermi-liquid behavior. The
characteristic energies of all studied parameters, including magneto
resistivity, show notably low values as an indication that these alloys are
close to a quantum critical point, which is approached from the non-magnetic
side as the Zn content decreases.

Abstract: The interplay between charge ordering and its manifestation in macroscopic
electrical transport in low-dimensional materials is crucial for understanding
resistive switching mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the electronic
transport and switching behavior of single-crystalline
$\beta$-Na$_{0.33}$V$_2$O$_5$, focusing on low-frequency resistance noise
dynamics of charge-order-driven resistive switching. Using electrical
transport, low frequency noise spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, we probe
electron dynamics across the Na-ion- ordering (IO) and charge-ordering (CO)
transitions. Near room temperature, the weak temperature dependence of the
noise spectral density points to a dominance of nearest-neighbor polaron
hopping. Below IO transition temperature (\( T_{IO} \sim 240 \, \text{K} \)),
structural analysis reveals that Na-ions adopt a zig-zag occupancy pattern,
breaking the two-fold rotational symmetry and influencing the electronic ground
state. Subsequently, a sharp drop in resistance noise below the CO transition
temperature (\( T_{CO} \sim 125 \, \text{K} \)) indicates the emergence of
correlated electron behavior. Furthermore, application of sufficient electric
field leads to the destabilization of the CO state, and a transition to a
high-conducting state. The material exhibits distinct resistive switching
between 35~K and 110~K, with a resistance change spanning two orders of
magnitude, primarily driven by electronic mechanisms rather than Joule heating.
These findings provide new insights into charge-order-induced switching and
electronic correlations in quasi-one-dimensional systems, with potential
applications in cryogenic memory and neuromorphic computing devices owing to
the low noise levels in their stable resistive states.

Abstract: A novel magnetic class blending ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, termed
altermagnetism, has gained significant attention for its staggered order in
coordinate and momentum spaces, time-reversal symmetry-breaking phenomena, and
promising applications in spintronics. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_{2}$) has been
considered a candidate material for altermagnetism, yet the presence of
magnetic moments on Ru atoms remains a subject of debate. In this study, we
systematically investigated the magnetic properties of RuO$_{2}$ powder using
nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements. The NQR spectra show that
there is no internal magnetic field. Furthermore, the temperature independence
of spin-lattice relaxation rate, $1/T_1T$, proves that there are no magnetic
fluctuations. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that Ru atoms in RuO$_{2}$
possess neither static magnetic moments nor fluctuating magnetic moments, and
thus RuO$_{2}$ does not possess the magnetic characteristics essential for
altermagnetism.

Abstract: CoNb$_2$O$_6$ is a unique magnetic material. It features bulk
three-dimensional magnetic order at low temperatures, but its quantum critical
behavior in a magnetic field is well described by the one-dimensional
transverse-field Ising universality class. This behavior is facilitated by the
structural arrangement of magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions in nearly isolated zig-zag
chains. In this work, we investigate the effect of random site dilution on the
critical properties of such a quasi-one-dimensional quantum Ising system. To
this end, we introduce an anisotropic site-diluted three-dimensional
transverse-field Ising model. We find that site dilution leads to
unconventional activated scaling behavior at the quantum phase transition.
Interestingly, the critical exponents of the quantum critical point are in good
agreement with those of the disordered three-dimensional transverse-field Ising
universality class, despite the strong spatial anisotropy. We discuss the
generality our findings as well as implications for experiments.

Abstract: The electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) metals are altered by
changes in their three-dimensional dielectric environment. In this Letter we
propose that superconductivity can be induced in a 2D metal by resonant
coupling between its plasmonic collective modes and optical phonons in a nearby
polar dielectric. Specifically, we predict that relatively high-temperature
superconductivity can be induced in bilayer graphene twisted to an angle
somewhat larger than the magic value by surrounding it with a THz polar
dielectric. Our conclusions are based on numerical solutions of Eliashberg
equations for massless Dirac fermions with tunable Fermi velocities and Fermi
energies, and can be understood qualitatively in terms of a generalized
McMillan formula.

Abstract: A new approach describing Luttinger Liquid with point-like impurity as field
theory for the phase of scattering is developed. It based on a matching of the
electron wave functions at impurity position point. As a result of the
approach, an expression for non-local action has been taken. The non-locality
of the theory leads to convergence of the observed values in an ultraviolet
region. It allows studying conductance of the channel up to electron-electron
interaction strength of the order of unit. Expansion of the non-local action in
small frequency powers makes possible to develop a new approach to the
renormalization group analysis of the problem. This method differs from the
"poor man's" approach widely used in solid-state physics. We have shown, in the
Luttinger Liquid "poor man's" approach breaks already in two-loop
approximation. We analyse the reason of this discrepancy. The qualitative
picture of the phenomenon is discussed.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) encapsulates the essential entanglement
properties of a quantum many-body system and serves as a powerful theoretical
construct. From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities,
such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum.
However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the
Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field
theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz
invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the
lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte
Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in
two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems
without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the
primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped
and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or
continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility
of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find
that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from
surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well
beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework
for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum
many-body systems.

Abstract: We present an improved version of the algorithm contracting and optimizing
finite projected entangled pair states (fPEPS) in conjunction with projected
entangled pair operators (PEPOs). Our work has two components to it. First, we
explain in detail the characteristic contraction patterns that occur in fPEPS
calculations and how to slice them such that peak memory occupation remains
minimal while ensuring efficient parallel computation. Second, we combine
controlled bond expansion [A. Gleis, J.-W. Li, and J. von Delft, Phys. Rev.

Rokhlin, A. Szlam, and M. Tygert, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. (2009)] and apply
it throughout the fPEPS algorithm. We present benchmark results for the Hubbard
model for system sizes up to 8x8 and SU(2) symmetric bond dimension of up to D
= 6 for PEPS bonds and $\chi$ = 500 for the environment bonds. Finally, we
comment on the state and future of the fPEPS-PEPO framework.

Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that strong non Fermi-liquid magnetic
oscillations of electron-electron scattering time can exist in
quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) conductors under condition of the magnetic
breakdown between two open electron orbits. They are shown to be due to
electron-electron interactions in a metallic phase under condition of the
magnetic breakdown and they are beyond the Fermi-liquid theory. In particular,
we consider as example the organic conductor (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ and perform
both analytical and numerical calculations for its known electron spectrum. We

Abstract: We theoretically show that strongly forbidden oscillations of a specific heat
have to exist in metallic phases of some quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D)
conductors. They appear due to electron-electron interactions under condition
of the magnetic breakdown phenomenon between the so-called open interference
electron orbits. We argue that such forbidden thermodynamic oscillations can
exist in Q1D conductors (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ and (Per)$_2$Au(mnt)$_2$, where
TMTSF stands for tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, Per is polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon and mnt is mononitrotoluene,
  and suggest to discover them.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Static correlation, the breakdown of mean-field theory in correlated
many-fermion systems, can be reframed as a quantitative gauge of the
fermion-sign problem. The variational energy gap between correlated
wavefunctions constrained by mean-field and exact Dirichlet nodes defines a
nodal penalty driven by their topological differences. Method-agnostic and
dictated solely by the sign structure of the wavefunction, this penalty
measures the intrinsic complexity of fermionic correlations. This framework
unifies orbital and real-space views and opens a general route toward a
rigorous, method-independent decomposition of electron correlation, guiding
topology-aware approaches and future node-centric strategies.

Abstract: Emergence of charge-2$e$ bosonic carriers as tightly bound electrons presents
perhaps the simplest route to understand the non-Fermi liquid behaviors widely
observed in functional materials. However, such scenario is typically discarded
when unbound electrons are observed near the chemical potential. Here, using
attractive Hubbard model as a representative example, we demonstrate the
emergence of such ''bosonic'' bound pairs in the presence of residual
low-energy electrons through determinant quantum Monte Carlo computation of
their propagators. Furthermore, above the superfluid temperature the electronic
spectral function is found to display a typical non-Fermi liquid behavior,
namely a pseudogap near the chemical potential. This study provides the
microscopic foundation for scenarios of boson-fermion mixed liquid as effective
descriptions for some of the strongly correlated functional materials.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) has been utilized to
investigate quantum and thermal phase transitions within magnetic models and,
more recently, in spintronic applications. The SCHA methodology involves
utilizing simple harmonic Hamiltonians, which are augmented with
renormalization parameters that incorporate high-order fluctuations typically
overlooked by conventional Linear Spin-Wave (LSW) theories. Although this
approach exhibits reasonable accuracy for models defined by large spin values,
its reliability diminishes when applied to quantum systems with $S=1/2$. The
traditional development of SCHA has incorporated semiclassical assumptions that
obscure quantum effects. In this study, we introduce a quantum framework for
the SCHA that eliminates the need for semiclassical approximations. Our Quantum
Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (QSCHA) utilizes the spin coherent
states formalism within a fully quantum formulation. Consequently, we derive a
novel renormalization parameter that accurately integrates quantum corrections.
To assess the efficacy of this new approach, we apply the QSCHA to analyze the
critical temperature transitions across various well-documented magnetic
models. The findings, combined with the simplified operational procedure
relative to other conventional interacting spin-wave methodologies, suggest
that QSCHA is a promising tool for advancing research in quantum magnetism and
spintronics.

Abstract: Phonons have long been thought to be incapable of explaining key phenomena in
strange metals, including linear-in-\textit{T} Planckian resistivity from high
to very low temperatures. We argue that these conclusions were based on static,
perturbative approaches that overlooked essential time-dependent and
nonperturbative electron-lattice physics. In fact ``phonons'' are not the best
target for discussion, just like ``photons'' are not the best way to think
about Maxwell's equations. Quantum optics connects photons and
electromagnetism, as developed 60 years ago by Glauber and others. We have been
developing the parallel world of quantum acoustics. Far from being only of
academic interest, the new tools are rapidly exposing the secrets of the
strange metals, revealing strong vibronic (vibration-electronic) interactions
playing a crucial role forming polarons and charge density waves, linear-in-$T$
resistivity at the Planckian rate over thousands of degrees, resolution of the
Drude peak infrared anomaly, and the absence of a $T^4$ low-temperature
resistivity rise in 2D systems, and of a Mott-Ioffe-Regel resistivity
saturation. We derive Planckian transport, polarons, CDWs, and pseudogaps from
the Fr\"ohlich model. The ``new physics'' has been hiding in this model all
along, in the right parameter regime, if it is treated nonperturbatively. In
the course of this work we have uncovered the generalization of Anderson
localization to dynamic media: a universal Planckian diffusion emerges, a
``ghost'' of Anderson localization. Planckian diffusion is clearly defined and
is more fundamental than the popular but elusive, model dependent concept of
``Planckian speed limit''.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) has been proposed as an improvement to
conventional quantum annealing for solving optimization problems, in which one
takes advantage of an initial guess at the solution to suppress problematic
phase transitions. Here we interpret the performance of ARA through its effects
on the free energy landscape, and use the intuition gained to introduce a
classical analogue to ARA termed ``simulated reverse annealing'' (SRA). This
makes it more difficult to claim that ARA provides a quantum advantage in
solving a given problem, as not only must ARA succeed but the corresponding SRA
must fail. As a solvable example, we analyze how both protocols behave in the
infinite-range (non-disordered) $p$-spin model. Through both the thermodynamic
phase diagrams and explicit dynamical behavior, we establish that the quantum
algorithm has no advantage over its classical counterpart: SRA succeeds not
only in every case where ARA does but even in a narrow range of parameters
where ARA fails.

Abstract: Quantum computers must operate in concert with classical computers to deliver
on the promise of quantum advantage for practical problems. To achieve that, it
is important to understand how quantum and classical computing can interact
together, and how one can characterize the scalability and efficiency of hybrid
quantum-classical workflows. So far, early experiments with quantum-centric
supercomputing workflows have been limited in scale and complexity. Here, we
use a Heron quantum processor deployed on premises with the entire
supercomputer Fugaku to perform the largest computation of electronic structure
involving quantum and classical high-performance computing. We design a
closed-loop workflow between the quantum processors and 152,064 classical nodes
of Fugaku, to approximate the electronic structure of chemistry models beyond
the reach of exact diagonalization, with accuracy comparable to some
all-classical approximation methods. Our work pushes the limits of the
integration of quantum and classical high-performance computing, showcasing
computational resource orchestration at the largest scale possible for current
classical supercomputers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The preparation of photonic qubits in the excited state is an integral part
of the performance of an on-demand single photon source (SPS). Conventional
resonant excitation, an excellent approach to maximize the coherence and
indistinguishability of the SPS, often requires polarization filtering to
remove the pump signal and isolate the qubit emission, but this results in an
inherent 50\% hit to the efficiency. Recent excitation schemes strategically
try to exploit pulses that excite the qubit while avoiding spectral overlap to
bypass this required filtering. In this work, we compare three such pumping
schemes to quantify the important SPS figures-of-merit for off-resonant quantum
dot schemes, using: (i) a symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulse, (ii) a
notch-filtered adiabatic rapid passage (NARP) pulse, and (iii) a swing up of
the quantum emitter population (SUPER) pulse. Due to large instantaneous pulse
strengths, the dichromatic pulse suffers from phonon-induced dephasing which
can lower the SPS performance by up to 50\%. In contrast, the NARP and SUPER
pulses are shielded from phonon coupling to differing degrees but both maintain
excellent SPS performance. The SUPER pulse can lose significant efficiency if
there is variance in its constituent pulses' amplitude, pulse width, or
frequency, while the NARP pulse, though potentially more difficult to realize
in experiments, is robust against variance in the pulse preparation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Quantum nonlocality is often judged by violations of Bell-type inequalities
for a given state. The computation of such violations is a global task,
requiring evaluation of global correlations and subsequent testing against a
Bell functional. We ask instead: when is a given state local (classical)? We
formalize this question via local perception operators (LPOs) that compress
global observables into locally accessible statistics, and we derive two
complementary witnesses -- one implementable by a single party with classical
side information, one intrinsically two-sided. These tools revisit familiar
Bell scenarios from a new operational angle. We show how the witness leads to
state-aware constraints that depend on local marginals and measurement
geometry, with natural specializations to canonical scenarios. The resulting
criteria are built from first moments and standard projective measurements and
provide a way to certify compatibility with local hidden variable explanations
for the LPO-processed data in regimes where conventional Bell violations may be
inconclusive.

Abstract: We considered the transfer of continuous-variable entangled states in coupled
oscillator chains embedded in a generic environment. We demonstrate
high-fidelity transfer via optimal control in two configurations - a linear
chain and an X-shaped chain. More specifically, we use the Krotov optimization
algorithm to design control fields that achieve the desired state transfer.
Under the environmental memory effects, the Krotov algorithm needs to be
modified, since the dissipative terms in non-Markovian dynamics are generally
governed by the time-dependent system Hamiltonian. Remarkably, we can achieve
high-fidelity transfer by simply tuning the frequencies of the oscillators
while keeping the coupling strength constant, even in the presence of
open-system effects. For the system under consideration, we find that quantum
memory effects can aid in the transfer of entanglement and show improvement
over the memoryless case. In addition, it is possible to target a range of
entangled states, making it unnecessary to know the parameters of the initial
state beforehand.

Abstract: Quantum information theory explores the limits of manipulating quantum
states. While auxiliary systems often enhance information processing, a
systematic explanation for their power has been lacking. This thesis addresses
this gap by investigating the underlying sources of strength in using auxiliary
systems. We then apply these insights to practical problems in quantum
computing and devise an algorithmic paradigm leveraging auxiliary systems. The
first part examines catalysts -- auxiliary systems that remain unaltered -- and
identifies three advantages: a memory effect, the ability to fine-tune catalyst
states, and their role as seed states for resource distribution. The second
part presents a strategy for solving recursive problems in quantum algorithms
by employing auxiliary states as memories, achieving an exponential reduction
in circuit depth at the cost of increased width. The findings in this thesis
would facilitate future research into fundamental problems like resource
interconversion and practical ones like optimal quantum circuit synthesis.

Abstract: Emergent quantum networks are the essential ingredient for securely
connecting multiple users worldwide, extensively deployed in both fibre and
free-space. An essential element is the multiplexing of entanglement to
multiple users, overcoming the peer-to-peer restriction of quantum key
distribution (QKD), so far successfully shown in fibre-based architectures.
Here, we demonstrate a free-space quantum space division multiplexing
architecture using just one entanglement source to realise a fully connected
twelve-channel quantum network for seamless QKD connections between six users.
The network achieves record coincidence rates exceeding $3 \times 10^{4}$
s$^{-1}$ between any pair of nodes on the network, for sifted key rate of over
400 kbps. Our approach overcomes the active switching hurdle that has hindered
the free-space deployment of quantum multiplexing, is fully passive, easily
scalable to more nodes and compatible with fibre-based integration, thus
opening a new path to scalable and resource-efficient quantum networks that
utilise free-space links.

Abstract: Quantum batteries are prone to loosing their stored charge, when interacting
with a thermal environment. However, getting a limited assistance from the
thermal environment, is it possible to recover the charge back, in a reusable
form? Here we answer this question affirmatively, leveraging a non-trivial
usage of the seemingly useless thermal environment to recycle the quantum
batteries. The framework involves two different kind of assistance from thermal
environment - one by accessing only the thermal particle, actively
participating in the interaction; and the other, involving assistance from an
additional purifying subsystem for the thermal environment, bearing a passive
role to the interaction. Interestingly, we report that the difference between
the retrieved charge between these two degrees of assistance characterizes the
amount of entanglement generated by the thermal operation between the quantum
battery and the purifying subsystem for the thermal environment.

Abstract: We present a quantum optimization methodology for solving large-scale Vehicle
Routing Problem (VRP) using a combination of standard and Multi-Angle Quantum
Approximate Optimization Algorithms (MA-QAOA). The approach decomposes
13-locations based VRP problems through clustering into three balanced clusters
of 4 nodes each, then applies standard QAOA for intra-cluster Open Loop
Traveling Salesman Problem (OTSP) and MA-QAOA for inter-cluster VRP routing.
Validation across 10 distinct datasets demonstrates that standard QAOA
consistently identifies optimal solutions for intra-cluster routing, which is
matching classical Gurobi optimizer results exactly. More significantly,
MA-QAOA with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation(SPSA) optimizer
demonstrates competitive performance against classical optimization methods,
ultimately converging towards a solution that closely approximates the
classical Gurobi optimizer result.The clustered decomposition enables quantum
optimization of problem sizes generally larger than previous quantum VRP
implementations, advancing from 4-6 location limits to 13-location problems
while maintaining solution quality.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the dynamics of quantum systems subjected to
a localized fermionic source in the presence of bulk dephasing. We consider two
classes of one-dimensional lattice systems: (i) a non-interacting lattice with
nearest-neighbor and beyond, i.e., long-ranged (power-law) hopping, and (ii) a
lattice that is interacting via short-range interactions modeled by a fermionic
quartic Hamiltonian. We study the evolution of the local density profile
$n_i(t)$ within the system and the growth of the total particle number $N(t)$
in it. For case (i), we provide analytical insights into the dynamics of the
nearest-neighbor model using an adiabatic approximation, which relies on
assuming faster relaxation of coherences of the single particle density matrix.
For case (ii), we perform numerical computations using the time-evolving block
decimation (TEBD) algorithm and analyze the density profile and the growth
exponent in $N(t)$. Our detailed study reveals an interesting interplay between
Hamiltonian dynamics and various environmentally induced mechanisms in open
quantum systems, such as local source and bulk dephasing. It brings out rich
dynamics, including universal dynamical scaling and anomalous behavior across
various time scales and is of relevance to various quantum simulation
platforms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Energy nonconservation is a prominent, testable prediction of collapse and
hybrid classical-quantum gravitational models. Without smearing of certain
operators, the associated heating (or energy increase) rate diverges, yet the
smearing distribution is arbitrary and, on scales much larger than the smearing
length $r_C$, much of the phenomenology is expected to be independent of this
choice. We propose to resolve this arbitrariness by a simple principle: for a
fixed $r_C$, select the distribution that minimizes the heating rate.
Conceptually, this should identify the minimal deviation from standard quantum
mechanics and provide models that, once experimentally refuted, would strongly
disfavor all variants with different distributions. We apply this approach to
the most investigated collapse models: GRW, CSL, and DP. Notably, the Gaussian
is optimal only for the GRW case. Finally, we apply it to the Tilloy-Di\'osi
hybrid classical-quantum model of Newtonian gravity, leading to the minimally
deviating variant of it. This version of the model is entirely determined by
only one free parameter (the smearing length $r_C$) and, if experimentally
refuted, would strongly disfavor any other version of it.

data as the original, although we propose a distinct data collection process
that requires a single type of measurement. Furthermore, we argue that weak
coherent states and intensity measurements are sufficient to proceed with the
characterization. Our work could then allow simpler platforms to be

Abstract: Quantum computing crucially relies on maintaining quantum coherence for the
duration of a calculation. Bosonic quantum error correction protects this
coherence by encoding qubits into superpositions of noise-resilient oscillator
states. In the case of the Kerr-cat qubit (KCQ), these states derive their
stability from being the quasi-degenerate ground states of an engineered
Hamiltonian in a driven nonlinear oscillator. KCQs are experimentally
compatible with on-chip architectures and high-fidelity operations, making them
promising candidates for a scalable bosonic quantum processor. However, their
bit-flip time must increase further to fully leverage these advantages. Here,
we present direct evidence that the bit-flip time in a KCQ is limited by
leakage out of the qubit manifold and experimentally mitigate this process. We
coherently control the leakage population and measure it to be > 9%, twelve
times higher than in the undriven system. We then cool this population back
into the KCQ manifold with engineered dissipation, identify conditions under
which this suppresses bit-flips, and demonstrate increased bit-flip times up to
3.6 milliseconds. By employing both Hamiltonian confinement and engineered
dissipation, our experiment combines two paradigms for Schr\"odinger-cat qubit
stabilization. Our results elucidate the interplay between these stabilization
processes and indicate a path towards fully realizing the potential of these
qubits for quantum error correction.

Abstract: We investigate a generalized quantum perceptron architecture characterized by
an oscillating activation function with a tunable frequency ranging from zero
to infinity. Employing analytical techniques from statistical mechanics, we
derive the optimal storage capacity and demonstrate that the classical result
is recovered in the limit of vanishing frequency. As the frequency increases,
however, the architecture exhibits enhanced quantum storage capabilities.
Notably, this improvement stems solely from the specific form of the activation
function and, in principle, could be emulated within a classical framework.
Accordingly, we refer to this enhancement as a pseudo quantum advantage.

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for building scalable quantum
computers, but a lack of systematic, end-to-end evaluation methods makes it
difficult to assess how different QEC codes perform under realistic conditions.
The vast diversity of codes, an expansive experimental search space, and the
absence of a standardized framework prevent a thorough, holistic analysis. To
address this, we introduce ECCentric, an end-to-end benchmarking framework
designed to systematically evaluate QEC codes across the full quantum computing
stack. ECCentric is designed to be modular, extensible, and general, allowing
for a comprehensive analysis of QEC code families under varying hardware
topologies, noise models, and compilation strategies.
  Using ECCentric, we conduct the first systematic benchmarking of major QEC
code families against realistic, mid-term quantum device parameters. Our
empirical analysis reveals that intra-QPU execution significantly outperforms
distributed methods, that qubit connectivity is a far more critical factor for
reducing logical errors than increasing code distance, and that compiler
overhead remains a major source of error. Furthermore, our findings suggest
that trapped-ion architectures with qubit shuttling are the most promising
near-term platforms and that on noisy devices, a strategic and selective
application of QEC is necessary to avoid introducing more errors than are
corrected. This study provides crucial, actionable insights for both hardware
designers and practitioners, guiding the development of fault-tolerant quantum
systems.

Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and
technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a
central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing
the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality
phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly
initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions.
Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a
size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open
quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used
quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit
re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong
Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual
advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to
accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements
conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.

Abstract: Quantum error correction uses the measurement of syndromes and classical
decoding algorithms to estimate the location and type of errors while
protecting the encoded quantum bits. Here we consider how prior information and
Bayesian updates can play a critical role in improving the performance of QEC
in the scenario of a particularly noisy qubit. This allows for leveraging even
distance codes, which typically are less valued in QEC, to handle the noisy
qubit, changing the power-law scaling of the logical error rate with the
baseline physical error rate. A crucial component of this is updating the prior
by real time feeding of decoder outputs into a approximate Kalman filter. Thus
our approach provides a bootstrap to the actual error rates. We show this via
simulation of the full closed-loop system: starting from uniform priors, the
update procedure gradually learns site-specific error rates, enabling the
decoder to outperform a fixed-prior baseline. In turn, we show that this
enables in situ calibration of unitary operations via injection of gate set
tomography operations with only moderate overhead in the more typical scenario
of low noise qubits.

Abstract: In this work, we consider a parameterized Ising model with long-range
symmetric pairwise interactions on a network of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particles.
The system is designed with symmetric dynamics, allowing for the reduction of
the state space to a subspace defined by the set of Dicke states. We propose a
method for designing robust electromagnetic amplitude pulses based on a moment
quantization approach. The introduced parameter accounts for uncertainties in
the electromagnetic field, resulting in a family of distinct Hamiltonians. By
employing a discretized moment-based quantization technique, we design a
control pulse capable of simultaneously steering an infinite collection of
dynamical systems to compensate for parameter variations. This approach
benefits from the duality between the infinite-dimensional parameterized system
and its finite-dimensional trucnated moment dynamics. Simulation results
demonstrate the efficacy of this method in achieving states of significant
interest in quantum sensing, including the GHZ and W states.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the scheme of attosecond quantum interferometry
(AQI), the quantum optical version of classical attosecond interferometry,
which allows to measure quantum optical properties on the attosecond
time-scale. We develop how the scheme of AQI can be used for quantum state
engineering of the emitted harmonics, by varying the relative phase of a
two-color driving field, and further enables one to manipulate the field
correlations as well as their entanglement characteristics. In addition, this
scheme allows us to learn properties of the phase-space distribution of the
harmonic quantum state, by means of measuring an attosecond quantum tomography
trace. This serves as a new type of protocol for in situ attosecond
measurements of quantum optical observables. With this, we achieve to further
connect all-optical attosecond measurement schemes with quantum optics,
allowing for a rich manifold of observations.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers significant potential for solving NP-hard
combinatorial (optimization) problems that are beyond the reach of classical
computers. One way to tap into this potential is by reformulating combinatorial
problems as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. The
solution of the QUBO reformulation can then be addressed using adiabatic
quantum computing devices or appropriate quantum computing algorithms on
gate-based quantum computing devices. In general, QUBO reformulations of
combinatorial problems can be readily obtained by properly penalizing the
violation of the problem's constraints in the original problem's objective.
However, characterizing tight (i.e., minimal but sufficient) penalty
coefficients for this purpose is critical for enabling the solution of the
resulting QUBO in current and near-term quantum computing devices. Along these
lines, we here focus on the (weighted) max $k$-cut problem, a fundamental
combinatorial problem with wide-ranging applications that generalizes the
well-known max cut problem. We present closed-form characterizations of tight
penalty coefficients for two distinct QUBO reformulations of the max $k$-cut
problem whose values depend on the (weighted) degree of the vertices of the
graph defining the problem. These findings contribute to the ongoing effort to
make quantum computing a viable tool for solving combinatorial problems at
scale. We support our theoretical results with illustrative examples. Further,
we benchmark the proposed QUBO reformulations to solve the max $k$-cut problem
on a quantum computer simulator.

Abstract: We introduce a witness-based framework for certifying quantum temporal
correlations via the pseudo-density matrix (PDM) formalism, which is a
spatiotemporal generalization of the density matrix. We define spatial
incompatibility (SI) as the minimum distance between a PDM and valid density
matrices. For trace-norm distance, we show that this reduces to the PDM's
negativity, enabling the construction of experimentally accessible SI
witnesses. We derive a tight bound on SI for quantum channels and analyze the
respective roles of state and channel coherence in witnessing SI. Crucially, SI
witnesses certify temporal correlations across a strictly broader class of
channels than Leggett-Garg (LG) tests. Our approach, unlike the LG framework,
exploits incompatible measurements that generate coherence through state
disturbance. We further show that channels satisfying the LG inequality for
incoherent states can still exhibit detectable SI, demonstrating that
measurement disturbance enhances the certification of temporal correlations.

Abstract: Electromagnetic simulations form an indispensable part of the design and

commercial platforms exist, open-source alternatives optimized for
high-performance computing remain limited. To address this gap, we introduce
SQDMetal, a Python-based API that integrates Qiskit Metal (IBM), Gmsh, Palace

workflow for superconducting quantum circuits. SQDMetal enables accurate,
efficient, and scalable simulations while remaining community-driven and free
from commercial constraints. In this work, we validate SQDMetal through mesh
convergence studies which benchmark SQDMetal against COMSOL Multiphysics and
Ansys, demonstrating excellent agreement for both eigenmode and electrostatic
(capacitance) simulations. Furthermore, we simulate superconducting resonators
and transmon qubits, showing reasonable agreement with experimental
measurements. SQDMetal also supports advanced capabilities, including
Hamiltonian extraction via the energy participation ratio (EPR) method,
incorporation of kinetic inductance effects, and full 3D modelling of device
geometry for improved predictive accuracy. By unifying open-source tools into a
single framework, SQDMetal lowers the barriers to entry for community members
seeking to access high-performance simulations to assist in the design and

Abstract: Quantum computing technology is advancing rapidly. Yet, even accounting for
these trends, a quantum leap would be needed for quantum computers to mean-
ingfully impact deep learning over the coming decade or two. We arrive at this
conclusion based on a first-of-its-kind survey of quantum algorithms and how
they match potential deep learning applications. This survey reveals three
important areas where quantum computing could potentially accelerate deep
learning, each of which faces a challenging roadblock to realizing its
potential. First, quantum algorithms for matrix multiplication and other
algorithms central to deep learning offer small theoretical improvements in the
number of operations needed, but this advantage is overwhelmed on practical
problem sizes by how slowly quantum computers do each operation. Second, some
promising quantum algorithms depend on practical Quantum Random Access Memory
(QRAM), which is underdeveloped. Finally, there are quantum algorithms that
offer large theoretical advantages, but which are only applicable to special
cases, limiting their practical benefits. In each of these areas, we support
our arguments using quantitative forecasts of quantum advantage that build on
the work by Choi et al. [2023] as well as new research on limitations and
quantum hardware trends. Our analysis outlines the current scope of quantum
deep learning and points to research directions that could lead to greater
practical advances in the field.

Abstract: Entangling gates between neighboring physical qubits are essential for
quantum error correction. Implementing them in an all-microwave manner
simplifies signal routing and control apparatus of superconducting quantum
processors. We propose and experimentally demonstrate an all-microwave
controlled-Z (CZ) gate that achieves high fidelity while suppressing residual
ZZ interactions. Our approach utilizes a fixed-frequency transmon coupler and
multi-path coupling, thereby sufficiently reducing the net transverse
interaction between data transmons to suppress residual ZZ interactions. The
controlled phase arises from the dispersive frequency shift of the $\fggetxt$
transition between the coupler and one of the data transmons conditioned on the
state of the other data transmon. Driving the transitions at the midpoint of
two dispersively shifted resonance frequencies induces state-dependent
geometric phases to achieve the CZ gate. Crucially, with this scheme, we can
maintain a small net transverse interaction between two data transmons while
increasing the coupling between the data and coupler transmons to accelerate
the CZ-gate speed. Additionally, we measure the coupler state after the gate to
detect a subset of decoherence-induced failures that occur during the gate
operation. These events constitute erasure errors with known locations,
enabling erasure-aware quantum error-correcting codes to improve future logical
qubit performance.

Abstract: Single-photon sources are vital for emerging quantum technologies. In
particular, Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising due to their
room-temperature stability, long spin coherence, and compatibility with
nanophotonic structures. A key challenge, however, is the reliable
identification of isolated NV centers, since conventional confocal microscopy
is diffraction-limited and cannot resolve emitter distributions within a focal
spot. Besides, the associated intensity scanning is a time-expensive procedure.
Here, we introduce a raster-scanned $g^{(2)}(0)$ mapping technique combined
with an inversion-based reconstruction algorithm. By directly measuring local
photon antibunching across the field of view, we extract the effective emitter
number within each focal spot and reconstruct occupancy maps on a
sub-focal-spot grid. This enables recovery of the number and spatial
distribution of emitters within regions smaller than the confocal focal spot,
thereby offering possibilities of going beyond the diffraction limit. Our
simulations confirm robust reconstruction of NV-center distributions. The
method provides a practical diagnostic tool for locating single-photon sources
in an efficient and accurate manner, at much lesser time and effort compared to
conventional intensity scanning. It offers valuable feedback for nanophotonic
device fabrication, supporting more precise and scalable integration of
NV-based quantum photonic technologies.

Abstract: Describing systems of superconducting atoms coupled to a continuum of
photonic modes at multiple separated locations in a waveguide, waveguide
quantum electrodynamics (QED) with giant atoms has emerged as a promising
platform for realizing quantum interconnect. Such systems have been reported to
exhibit rich phenomena that differ from those of natural atoms. Going beyond
the widely used Born-Markov and Wigner-Weisskopf approximations, we investigate
the non-Markovian dynamics of one and two giant atoms interacting with a
waveguide formed by an array of coupled resonators. We discover that the
diverse dynamical behaviors of the giant atoms are intrinsically determined by
the energy spectrum of the composite system consisting of the giant atoms and
the photonic modes in the waveguide. As long as one and more bound states are
present in the energy spectrum, their excited-state probabilities,
respectively, tend to stable finite values and lossless Rabi-like oscillations
with frequencies proportional to the differences of the bound-state
eigenenergies. Our result provides an insightful guideline for suppressing the
decoherence of giant atoms and facilitates the development of quantum
interconnect devices using giant-atom waveguide QED.

Abstract: One way to approximate a quantum annealing schedule is to use multiple
quantum walks chained together, without intermediate measurements, to produce a
multi-stage quantum walk (MSQW). Previous work has shown that MSQW is better
than QAOA (quantum alternating operator ansatz) for solving optimization tasks
using multiple stages [Gerblich et al, arXiv:2407.06663]. In this work, we
develop an efficient heuristic for choosing the free parameters in MSQW, and
use it to obtain improved scaling compared to single stage quantum walks. We
show numerically that the heuristic works well for easy problems with a large
minimum energy gap, giving a scaling polynomial in the number of stages,
leading to an overall algorithm that scales polynomially in time. For harder
problems, the scaling breaks down such that adding more stages decreases the
success probability, leading to an overall scaling that is exponential in time,
as expected. Our methods are general and can be applied to any optimization
problem to obtain good annealing schedules.

Abstract: Metastability-exchange collisions (MECs) lie at the heart of
metastability-exchange optical pumping (MEOP) in 3He, enabling the transfer of
polarization from the metastable state to the ground state, as well as the
optical detection of nuclear magnetic resonance. Leveraging MECs, optically
pumped 3He nuclear magnetometers have been developed since the earliest
demonstrations of MEOP. However, it also induces an additional frequency shift
and relaxation of the nuclear spin precession, thereby limiting the sensitivity
of the magnetometer. In this work, we identify a new source of frequency shift
and relaxation in the 3He nuclear spin, arising from the light shift. This
effect arises from an MEC-mediated interaction between light and the nucleon
spin. We develop a theoretical model to describe this light-induced effect and
highlight its significance in low magnetic fields. This effect is
experimentally demonstrated, and its dependence on various parameters --
including magnetic field strength, light intensity, and wavelength -- is
investigated. Our result provides a better understanding of the frequency shift
and relaxation of 3He spin precession under MEOP conditions. Moreover, our
experiment reveals an MEC-mediated coupling between the 3He nuclear spin and
light, which may indicate the feasibility of MEC-assisted optical manipulation
of 3He nuclear spins at the quantum level, as proposed in several theoretical
schemes.

Abstract: Building on the standard hierarchy of pure states (HOPS) approach, we
construct a generalized formulation suitable for open quantum systems
interacting with nonstationary Gaussian baths, potentially extending its
applicability to nonequilibrium baths. This is achieved by extending the
conventional exponential decomposition of bath correlation functions (BCF) to
allow explicitly time-dependent forms. We demonstrate the method's performance
on two examples of nonstationary squeezed reservoirs generated via uniform
squeezing and degenerate parametric amplification. Benchmarking against the
associated hierarchy of master equations shows that HOPS achieves superior
efficiency under hierarchy truncation. In cases where each contribution in the
BCF expansion can be associated with an independent physical bath, the
formalism can be simplified in a pseudomode representation which is more
efficient in a strongly non-Markovian regime. Our results highlight HOPS as a
versatile and powerful tool for simulating open quantum systems in
nonstationary baths, with potential applications ranging from squeezed
light-matter interactions to driven quantum materials and dissipative phase
transitions.

High-quality gates between distributed chips enable the simplification of

remote quantum geometric gate scheme via parametric modulation. Our scheme
inherits the intrinsic robustness of geometric phases. Meanwhile, by employing
gradient-based optimization algorithms(Adaptive Moment Estimation) from deep
learning, we design control waveforms that significantly suppress population
leakage. We experimentally realize the rapid remote SWAP and
$\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gates with high fidelity, completing operation in about 30
ns. The gate error of SWAP ($\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$) is 1.16\% (0.91\%) after
excluding the effect of energy relaxation. The simulation demonstrate that this
scheme can be implemented in the distributed chips connected by cables
extending several meters. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed protocol in enabling modular quantum processors, offering a promising

Abstract: Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) provide hardware-level security by
exploiting intrinsic randomness to produce device-unique responses. However,
machine learning and side-channel attacks increasingly undermine their
classical assumptions, calling for new approaches to ensure unforgeability.
Quantum mechanics naturally supports this goal through intrinsic randomness and
the no-cloning theorem, motivating the study of Quantum Physical Unclonable
Functions (QPUFs). Yet, existing QPUF models often assume ideal unitary
dynamics, neglecting non-unitary effects such as decoherence and dissipation
that arise in real quantum devices. This work introduces a new class of
non-unitary QPUFs that leverage open quantum system dynamics as a foundation
for security. Three architectures are proposed: the Dissipative QPUF (D-QPUF),
which uses amplitude damping as an entropy source; the Measurement-Feedback
QPUF (MF-QPUF), which employs mid-circuit measurements and conditional
unitaries; and the Lindbladian QPUF (L-QPUF), which models Markovian noise via
the Lindblad master equation and Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. Simulation
results show that these non-unitary designs achieve strong uniqueness,
uniformity, and unforgeability, with controllable reliability trade-offs from
stochastic noise. The L-QPUF, in particular, exhibits exponential modeling
resistance under limited challenge-response access. By reframing environmental
noise as a constructive resource, this work establishes a framework for
noise-aware quantum hardware authentication and highlights non-unitary
evolution as a viable foundation for post-quantum security.

Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET), implemented via local operations and
classical communication, enables carrier-free energy transfer by exploiting
quantum resources. While QET has been extensively studied theoretically and
validated experimentally in various quantum platforms, enhancing energy output
for mixed initial states, as the system inevitably interacts with environments,
remains a significant challenge. In this work, we study QET performance in a
two-qubit system coupled to equilibrium or nonequilibrium reservoirs. We derive
an analytical expression for the energy output in terms of the system
Hamiltonian eigenstates, enabling analysis of energy output for mixed states.
Using the Redfield master equation, we systematically examine the effects of
qubit detuning, nonequilibrium temperature difference, and nonequilibrium
chemical potential difference on the energy output. We find that the energy
output for mixed states often follows that of the eigenstate with the highest
population, and that nonequilibrium environments can enhance the energy output
in certain parameter regimes.

Abstract: The weak values and weak measurement formalism were initially limited to pure
states, which were later extended to mixed states, leading to intriguing
applications in quantum information processing tasks. Weak values are
considered to be abstract properties of systems describing a complete picture
between successive measurements in the two-state vector formalism (TSVF). The
remarkable achievements of the weak value formalism in experimental quantum
mechanics have persuaded most quantum physicists that it is impeccable.
However, we explore a scenario where the formalism of weak values for mixed
states is employed in a quantum communication protocol, but discover that it
generates inaccurate outcomes. This reinforces our previous conclusion that the
weak values may not be elements of the reality of weak measurements, contrary
to what the proponents of weak values proposed.

Abstract: Estimating the fidelity between an unknown quantum state and a fixed target
is a fundamental task in quantum information science. Direct fidelity
estimation (DFE) enables this without full tomography by sampling observables
according to a target-dependent distribution. However, existing approaches face
notable trade-offs. Grouping-based DFE achieves strong accuracy for small
systems but suffers from exponential scaling, and its applicability is
restricted to Pauli measurements. In contrast, classical-shadow-based DFE
offers scalability but yields lower accuracy on structured states. In this
work, we address these limitations by developing two classes of operator-aware
shadow importance sampling algorithms using informationally overcomplete
positive operator-valued measures. Instantiated with local Pauli measurements,
our algorithm improves upon the grouping-based algorithms for Haar-random
states. For structured states such as the GHZ and W states, our algorithm also
eliminates the exponential memory requirements of previous grouping-based
methods. Numerical experiments confirm that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance across Haar-random, GHZ, and W targets.

Abstract: This work investigates measurement strategies for link parameter estimation
in Quantum Network Tomography (QNT), where network links are modeled as
depolarizing quantum channels distributing Werner states. Three distinct
measurement schemes are analyzed: local Z-basis measurements (LZM), joint
Bell-state measurements (JBM), and pre-shared entanglement-assisted
measurements (PEM). For each scheme, we derive the probability distributions of
measurement outcomes and examine how noise in the distributed states influences
estimation precision. Closed-form expressions for the Quantum Fisher
Information Matrix (QFIM) are obtained, and the estimation precision is
evaluated through the Quantum Cramer-Rao Bound (QCRB). Numerical analysis
reveals that the PEM scheme achieves the lowest QCRB, offering the highest
estimation accuracy, while JBM provides a favorable balance between precision
and implementation complexity. The LZM method, although experimentally simpler,
exhibits higher estimation error relative to the other schemes; however, it
outperforms JBM in high-noise regimes for single-link estimation. We further
evaluate the estimation performance on a four-node star network by comparing a
JBM-only configuration with a hybrid configuration that combines JBM and LZM.
When two monitors are used, the JBM-only strategy outperforms the hybrid
approach across all noise regimes. However, with three monitors, it achieves a
lower QCRB only in low-noise regimes with heterogeneous links. The results
establish a practical basis for selecting measurement strategies in
experimental quantum networks, enabling more accurate and scalable link
parameter estimation under realistic noise conditions.

Abstract: We theoretically analyse the relation between non-Gaussianity and security of
entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, namely
device-independent (DI) and entanglement-based BB$84$. A similar analysis has
already been made for prepare-and-measure (P\&M) protocols \cite{Lasota2017}.
In addition, we consider imperfect detection with dark counts and limited
efficiency. We assume a perfect source of entangled Bell states as produced by
quantum-dot type sources, depolarisation in the channel and different noise
statistics, namely thermal and Poissonian. We consider single-photon avalanche
photodiodes (SPAD) and photon number resolving detectors (PNRD) and use their
respective criteria for non-Gaussianity. The results show cross-regions for
both security and non-Gaussianity, hence, the possibility to conclude about the
suitability of a given channel for secret key distribution. Our results can be
useful as a pre-check for the implementation of QKD protocols.

Abstract: An important task in multi-objective optimization is generating the Pareto
front -- the set of all Pareto-optimal compromises among multiple objective
functions applied to the same set of variables. Since this task can be
computationally intensive even for small problems, it is a natural target for
quantum optimization. Indeed, this problem was recently approached using the
quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) on an IBM gate-model
processor. Here we compare these QAOA results with quantum annealing on the
same two input problems, using the same methodology. We find that quantum
annealing vastly outperforms not just QAOA run on the IBM processor, but all
classical and quantum methods analyzed in the previous study. On the harder
problem, quantum annealing improves upon the best known Pareto front. This
small study reinforces the promise of quantum annealing in multi-objective
optimization.

Abstract: Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBMs) are powerful quantum generative models
that sample according to the Born rule, with complexity-theoretic evidence
suggesting potential quantum advantages for generative tasks. Here, we identify
QCBMs as a quantum Fourier model independently of the loss function. This
allows us to apply known dequantization conditions when the optimal quantum
distribution is available. However, realizing this distribution is hindered by
trainability issues such as vanishing gradients on quantum hardware. Recent
train-classical, deploy-quantum approaches propose training classical
surrogates of QCBMs and using quantum devices only for inference. We analyze
the limitations of these methods arising from deployment discrepancies between
classically trained and quantumly deployed parameters. Using the Fourier
decomposition of the Born rule in terms of correlators, we quantify this
discrepancy analytically. Approximating the decomposition via distribution
truncation and classical surrogation provides concrete examples of such
discrepancies, which we demonstrate numerically. We study this effect using
tensor-networks and Pauli-propagation-based classical surrogates. Our study
examines the use of IQP circuits, matchcircuits, Heisenberg-chain circuits, and
Haldane-chain circuits for the QCBM ansatz. In doing so, we derive closed-form
expressions for Pauli propagation in IQP circuits and the dynamical Lie algebra
of the Haldane chain, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Computation with the Ising model is central to future computing technologies
like quantum annealing, adiabatic quantum computing, and thermodynamic
classical computing. Traditionally, computed values have been equated with
ground states. This paper generalizes computation with ground states to
computation with spin averages, allowing computations to take place at high
temperatures. It then introduces a systematic correspondence between Ising
devices and neural networks and a simple method to run trained feed-forward
neural networks on Ising-type hardware. Finally, a mathematical proof is
offered that these implementations are always successful.

Abstract: Twisting and stacking two copies of a 2D crystal can produce a
long-wavelength periodic interference pattern known as a moir\'e pattern.
Performing the same procedure with an aperiodic structure instead generates a
single moir\'e spot at the rotation center, known as a Glass pattern. We
explore the implications of these patterns across a variety of models: they
allow measurement of microscopic parameters from mesoscopic resistivity
measurements; they generate an impurity that modifies the properties of a
moir\'e lattice at the rotation center; and they allow for domain formation in
amorphous magnets. These results establish Glass patterns as a generic feature
of twisted disordered systems and provide a framework for future theoretical
and experimental exploration.
