Here, we introduce a computational framework based on normalizing flows that directly maps solvent configurations between solutes of different sizes, and compare the accuracy and efficiency to conventional free energy estimates. For a Lennard-Jones solvent, we demonstrate that this approach yields acceptable accuracy in estimating free energy differences for challenging transformations, such as solute growth or increased solute-solute separation, which typically demand multiple intermediate simulation steps along the transformation. Analysis of radial distribution functions indicates that the flow generates physically meaningful solvent rearrangements, substantially enhancing configurational overlap between states in configuration space. These results suggest flow-based models as a promising alternative to traditional free energy estimation methods."}

Underlying physical mechanisms of such current reversals are not fully understood yet. Predicting their appearance is difficult, in particular for interaction-induced ones that emerge upon changes of the particle density. We here derive conditions on external time-dependent drivings, under which current reversals occur in lattice gases with arbitrary pair interactions. Our derivation is based on particle-hole symmetry and shows that current reversals must emerge if the time-varying driving potential changes sign after a translation in time and/or space. Our treatment includes nonstationary dynamics and time-dependent spatially averaged currents in nonequilibrium steady states. It gives insight also into possible occurrences of current reversals in continuous-space dynamics, which we demonstrate for hardcore interacting particles driven across a periodic potential by a traveling wave."}

Motivated by this surprising observation, we propose a theoretical framework that captures the intertwinement between superconductivity and fractionalization in a lattice setting. Leveraging the duality between three field-theoretic descriptions of the Jain topological order, we find that bandwidth tuning can drive a single parent FCI at $ν= 2/3$ into five different superconductors, some of which are intrinsically non-Abelian and support Majorana zero modes. Our results reveal a rich landscape of exotic superconductors with no normal state Fermi surface and predict novel higher-charge superconductors coexisting with neutral non-Abelian topological order at more general filling fractions $ν= p/(2p+1)$."}

Already, the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is the cornerstone of many quantum algorithms, but the Laplace transform or its discrete version has not seen any efficient implementation on quantum computers due to its dissipative nature and hence non-unitary dynamics. However, a recent work has shown an efficient implementation for certain cases on quantum computers using the Taylor series. Unlike previous work, our work provides a completely different algorithm for doing Laplace Transform using Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation and Lap-LCHS, very efficiently at points which form an arithmetic progression. Our algorithm can implement $N \\times N$ discrete Laplace transform in gate complexity that grows as $O((log\\,N)^3)$, ignoring the state preparation cost, where $N=2^n$ and $n$ is the number of qubits, which is a superpolynomial speedup in number of gates over the best classical counterpart that has complexity $O(N\\cdot log\\,N)$ for the same cases. Also, the circuit width grows as $O(log\\,N)$. Quantum Laplace Transform (QLT) may enable new Quantum algorithms for cases like solving differential equations in the Laplace domain, developing an inverse Laplace transform algorithm on quantum computers, imaginary time evolution in the resolvent domain for calculating ground state energy, and spectral estimation of non-Hermitian matrices."}

Accurate prediction of LC mortality rates is crucial for guiding targeted interventions and addressing health disparities. Although traditional regression-based models have been commonly used, explainable machine learning models may offer enhanced predictive accuracy and deeper insights into the factors influencing LC mortality. This study applied three models: random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and linear regression (LR) to predict county-level LC mortality rates across the United States. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values were used to determine variable importance and their directional impact. Geographic disparities in LC mortality were analyzed through Getis-Ord (Gi*) hotspot analysis. The RF model outperformed both GBR and LR, achieving an R2 value of 41.9% and an RMSE of 12.8. SHAP analysis identified smoking rate as the most important predictor, followed by median home value and the percentage of the Hispanic ethnic population. Spatial analysis revealed significant clusters of elevated LC mortality in the mid-eastern counties of the United States. The RF model demonstrated superior predictive performance for LC mortality rates, emphasizing the critical roles of smoking prevalence, housing values, and the percentage of Hispanic ethnic population. These findings offer valuable actionable insights for designing targeted interventions, promoting screening, and addressing health disparities in regions most affected by LC in the United States."}

The facility layout problem is modeled as a combinatorial assignment problem with dense logical structure arising from adjacency, separation, and slot-availability constraints. We develop a CNF-based formulation for layout feasibility and compare CDCL-based SAT solving against CP-SAT and MILP formulations under a unified benchmarking framework. Empirical results show that CDCL exhibits near-constant runtime behavior for feasibility detection across increasing problem sizes and constraint densities, while CP-SAT and MILP display polynomial and exponential scaling respectively. To address the limitation of CDCL in objective optimization, we introduce two hybrid architectures that combine CDCL-based feasibility search with CP-SAT optimization. The first architecture rapidly enumerates feasible layouts to trade optimality for speed, while the second uses CDCL to generate warm-start solutions that accelerate exact optimization. The results demonstrate that hybrid approaches can significantly reduce time-to-solution while preserving correctness guarantees, clarifying the algorithmic trade-offs between clause-learning search and exact optimization methods in large-scale discrete layout problems."}

Yet, most models implement such asymmetry phenomenologically. Here we show that non-reciprocity can emerge from internal topology alone. Agents evolve on an internal ``context manifold'' coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. Because the gauge field is first order in time, it relaxes rapidly; eliminating it yields an effective transverse, antisymmetric interaction kernel that generically produces chiral waves, persistent vorticity, and irreversible state transitions. Numerical simulations reveal clear signatures of broken reciprocity: long-lived vortex cores, finite circulation, asymmetric information flow, and a nonzero reciprocity residual. The dynamics further exhibit pronounced hysteresis under parameter sweeps, demonstrating memory effects that cannot occur in reciprocal or potential-driven systems. These results identify Chern-Simons gauge fields as a minimal and universal source of directional influence and robust non-reciprocal collective behavior."}

Here, we analyze the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model in a stochastic setting where disease extinction -- a sudden clearance of the infection -- occurs via a rare, large fluctuation. We use a semiclassical approximation and extensive numerical simulations to show how the extinction risk of the disease depends on both the duration and magnitude of the lockdown, in heterogeneous assortative networks, with degree-degree correlations between neighboring nodes."}

The resulting diagrams reveal three regimes: a completely extended phase, a completely localized phase, and a mixed domain where localized and extended states coexist. In the diagrams, we investigate the behaviors of tightly and loosely wound helices and examine a special case where the number of sites per turn is a Fibonacci number. For moderate numbers of sites per helical turn, the mixed region is broad and also shifts with the long-range coupling. When the turn size is a Fibonacci number, the phase boundary becomes nearly horizontal and the mixed region fades out, effectively recovering the standard Aubry-André model behavior."}

Specifically, electron crystals stabilized by longrange Coulomb interactions may host collective vibrational excitations emerging from electron correlations10, termed electronic phonons, which are fundamentally distinct from atomic lattice phonons. Despite theoretical prediction of their existence in moiré electron crystals11, direct experimental evidence has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of electronic phonons in the Mott insulating and stripe phases of a WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice, achieved through light scattering measurements. The phonon energies, temperature and filling factor dependencies, along with theoretical modeling, corroborate their origin as collective vibrations of a correlated electron crystal. Polarization-resolved measurements further indicate rotational symmetry breaking in the Mott state. Notably, these electronic phonons exhibit strong tunability in energy, intensity, and polarization under external electric or magnetic fields, highlighting rich and controllable lattice dynamics of the electron crystal. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for the electronic crystalline nature of correlated phases, opening avenues for probing and manipulating collective excitations in correlated electron systems."}

We define the Price of Monotonicity (PoM) as the relative change in standard performance metrics when moving from unconstrained to constrained models, estimated via paired comparisons with bootstrap uncertainty. In our experiments, PoM in AUC ranges from essentially zero to about 2.9 percent: constraints are almost costless on large datasets (typically less than 0.2 percent, often indistinguishable from zero) and most costly on smaller datasets with extensive constraint coverage (around 2-3 percent).

In this work, we observe that neuron identification can be viewed as the inverse process of machine learning, which allows us to derive guarantees for neuron explanations. Based on this insight, we present the first theoretical analysis of two fundamental challenges: (1) Faithfulness: whether the identified concept faithfully represents the neuron's underlying function and (2) Stability: whether the identification results are consistent across probing datasets. We derive generalization bounds for widely used similarity metrics (e.g. accuracy, AUROC, IoU) to guarantee faithfulness, and propose a bootstrap ensemble procedure that quantifies stability along with BE (Bootstrap Explanation) method to generate concept prediction sets with guaranteed coverage probability. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the practicality of our method, providing an important step toward trustworthy neuron identification."}

Applying EOMC to the Lorenz-96 dynamical system (a very popular model of a simplified atmosphere dynamics)in chaotic and strongly-chaotic regimes reveals that its dynamics is essentially described by a metastable regime-switching process, making infrequent transitions between the very persistent three-dimensional attractive manifolds. The dimensionality of these manifolds appears to remain unchanged, and their overall number gradually grows with the growing external forcing of the Lorenz-96 model. At the same time, the Markovian mean exit times and relaxation times (that bound the predictability horizons for the identified regime-switching process) appear to decrease only very slowly with the growing external forcing - indicating approximately two-fold longer prediction horizons then is currently anticipated based on analysis of positive Lyapunov exponents for this system, even in very chaotic model regimes. It is also demonstrated that when applied for a lossy compression of the Lorenz-96 output data in various forcing regimes, EOMC achieves several orders of magnitude smaller compression loss - when compared to the common PCA-related linear compression approaches that build a backbone of the state-of-the-art lossy data compression tools (like JPEG, MP3, and others).

Despite a few decades of research, a comprehensive and systematic rigorous characterisation of their spatial and, even more, time dependent properties has remained elusive. Among the obstacles, we can mention their out of equilibrium and non-linear dynamics features which prevent, in general, the access to the stationary properties explicitly. In fact, even the knowledge of the stationary state is quite exceptional in sandpiles. In that respect, it has become standard to develop a model to model strategy and, so to say, general results or tools applicable to these systems are missing. In this paper, we unveil general and simple properties of time transport correlations in certain classes of abelian sandpile models. We proceed gradually, starting from results applicable in a broad context, to more and more specific ones, consequently valid to smaller and smaller classes. For instance, we show, under a few hypothesis, that the number of particles dissipated displays mostly anticorrelation in time. Besides, on a more integrable point of view, the approach followed might culminate with the proof of a link between 2-points time transport correlations and the second moment of the integrated transport over time. To be clear, these two quantities are related through a linear system of equations which is explicitly solved and applies to at least three 1D sandpile models, namely the Directed Stochastic Sandpile, the Oslo and the Activated Random Walk (in a peculiar setup) models."}

We identify boundaries separating extended, mixed, and localized regimes by constructing a diagram incorporating potential strength and inter-ring coupling. In the metallic regime, persistent currents flowing around both the toroidal and poloidal directions show oscillations whose amplitude decays as disorder grows and vanishes past the localization threshold; in the localized regime, currents become flux-insensitive. We demonstrate that tuning magnetic fluxes, hopping strengths, or quasiperiodic potential amplitudes provides control over the critical disorder threshold.

We extend the model to few-shot learning scenarios by first pre-training a convolutional neural operator using a source dataset and then adjusting the parameters of the trained neural operator using only a small target dataset. We investigate three strategies for adjusting the parameters of a trained neural operator, including fine-tuning, low-rank adaption, and neuron linear transformation, and find that the neuron linear transformation strategy enjoys the highest surrogate accuracy in solving PDEs such as Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, Brusselator diffusion-reaction system, and Navier-Stokes equations."}

Yet most existing LLM-based MAS either adopt fully connected graphs, simple sparse rings, or ad-hoc dynamic selection, with little structural guidance. In this work, we revisit classic theory on small-world (SW) networks and ask: what changes if we treat SW connectivity as a design prior for MAS? We first bridge insights from neuroscience and complex networks to MAS, highlighting how SW structures balance local clustering and long-range integration. Using multi-agent debate (MAD) as a controlled testbed, experiment results show that SW connectivity yields nearly the same accuracy and token cost, while substantially stabilizing consensus trajectories. Building on this, we introduce an uncertainty-guided rewiring scheme for scaling MAS, where long-range shortcuts are added between epistemically divergent agents using LLM-oriented uncertainty signals (e.g., semantic entropy). This yields controllable SW structures that adapt to task difficulty and agent heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss broader implications of SW priors for MAS design, framing them as stabilizers of reasoning, enhancers of robustness, scalable coordinators, and inductive biases for emergent cognitive roles."}

The algorithm which we use for computing CLVs is the one developed by Ginelli and collaborators (G&C), which is quite efficient and has been used previously in many numerical investigations. Using two low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems as toy models, we develop a method for measuring the convergence rates of vectors and subspaces computed via the G&C algorithm, and we use the time it takes for this convergence to occur to determine the appropriate transient time lengths needed when applying this algorithm to compute CLVs. The tangent dynamics of the centre subspace of the Hénon-Heiles system is investigated numerically through the use of CLVs, and we propose a method that improves the accuracy of the centre subspace computed with the G&C algorithm. As another application of the method of CLVs to the Hénon-Heiles system, we find that the splitting subspaces (which form a splitting of the tangent space and define the CLVs) become almost tangent during sticky regimes of motion, an observation which is related to the hyperbolicity of the system. Additionally, we investigate the dynamics of bubbles (i.e. thermal openings between base pairs) in homogeneous DNA sequences using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois lattice model of DNA. For the purpose of studying short-lived bubbles in DNA, the notions of instantaneous Lyapunov vectors (ILVs) are introduced in the context of Hamiltonian dynamics. While we find that the size of the opening between base pairs has no clear relationship with the spatial distribution of the first CLV at that site, we do observe a distinct relationship with various ILV distributions."}

This system possessing permutation symmetry displays rich collective behaviors, including a species-mixed chiral phase with quasi-long-range polar order and a species separation phase characterized by vortex cells. The system also displays a coexistence phase of the chiral and the species separation phases, in which intriguing dynamic patterns emerge.

On its face, it repudiates many of the key features of the mechanical conception of physical reality. However, the challenge of developing a precise, coherent alternative to that conception has yet to be met. Here, I argue that a major hindrance to the project of quantum interpretation is its existing interpretative methodologies, which suffer from a lack of systematicity in their judgements about what aspects of the theory are interpretational relevant. In particular, I argue that current interpretations tend to marginalize the informal part of the theory in favour of its formal part, and place inappropriate emphasis on the natural language component of the formalism over its detailed mathematical structure. To counterbalance these biases, I propose that an interpretation-free zone be constructed around the theory, wherein an interpreter initially adopt a descriptive stance which considers all parts of the theory, and that the results of this deliberation~(and the judgements about what facts are interpretationally relevant) are reported as part of their interpretation.\n  I argue that the interpretation of quantum theory poses special challenges and difficulties which necessitate this interpretation-free zone, and that existing interpretative methodologies are insufficient to address them. Further, I argue that a reconstructive interpretative methodology, which harnesses the recent results of the quantum reconstruction program, provides a powerful means to identify almost all facts that could be interpretationally relevant, and naturally meets these challenges and difficulties. Moreover, I argue that the quantum reconstruction program offers a powerful way to discover new physical principles, and offers a systematic pathway to build a rich, coherent conception of quantum reality."}

We present CodeGEMM, a codebook-centric GEMM kernel that replaces dequantization with precomputed inner products between centroids and activations stored in a lightweight Psumbook. At inference, code indices directly gather these partial sums, eliminating per-element lookups and reducing the on-chip footprint.

Precisely, we investigate chaos through the topological horseshoes associated with the first, second, and third return maps, obtained by varying the amplitude of an external force term while keeping all other parameters fixed. Our new finding demonstrates that, when the force amplitude exceeds a certain value, the topological (Smale) horseshoe degenerates into a pseudo-horseshoe, while chaotic invariant set persists. This phenomenon indicates that the lower bound of the topological entropy decreases as the force amplitude increases, thereby enriching the dynamics in the perturbed Duffing system.\n  Furthermore, we identify a critical value of the force amplitude governing the attractivity of the chaotic invariant set. For amplitudes slightly below this value, the basin of attraction of the chaotic invariant set progressively shrinks as the amplitude increases. In contrast, for larger amplitudes, both Lyapunov exponents become negative while the topological horseshoe persists, suggesting that the chaotic invariant set loses attractivity as the amplitude grows."}

The combination of Potts symmetry and nonreciprocity gives rise to a rich phase diagram. The nonreciprocal phase shift generates either counter-clockwise or clockwise chirality. Potts symmetry can be broken spontaneously. Consequently, the system exhibits four distinct phases: A species-mixed chiral phase where particles perform counter-clockwise chiral motion with quasi-long-range order, a species separation phase where Potts symmetry is broken and species-separated particles form vortex cells with clockwise chirality, a coexistence phase, and a disordered phase. We derive a Boltzmann equation and a hydrodynamic equation describing the system in the continuum limit, and present analytic arguments for the emergence of chirality and species separation."}

Our experiments demonstrate that both LoRA and QLoRA can match the recognition performance of full fine-tuning while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, memory usage, and training time.

Combining a systematic mean-field bifurcation analysis with large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions, we map the model's dynamical regimes and transitions. Mean-field theory predicts a rich phase structure -- disorder, a time-dependent 'swap' (limit-cycle) phase, and static ordered states -- separated by Hopf, saddle-node on invariant circle, saddle-node of limit cycles, pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations. In two dimensions, Monte Carlo simulations reveal that spiral defects destabilise global swapping and, unless vacancies are strongly favoured, destroy long-range order. Crucially, a finite single-ion anisotropy $Δ_α= - Δ_β$ promotes vacancy occupation in the $α$ species and suppresses nonreciprocal dynamics, thereby restoring a robust static ordered phase. Finite-size scaling of susceptibility and Binder cumulants places the disorder to static transition firmly in the 2D Ising universality class. Moreover, within the static ordered phase, we observe a crossover that sharpens into a line of first-order phase transitions; these two regimes are separated by a critical point, analogous to the termination of the liquid-gas coexistence curve. In three dimensions, simulations largely mirror mean-field expectations, though swap to static ordering occurs indirectly via a disordered regime. Our results demonstrate that vacancy energetics provide a simple, experimentally relevant control knob that stabilises equilibrium-like order in nonreciprocal systems and that defects can generate novel critical behaviour."}

We propose HINT, a Hybrid INductive-Transductive Network, and an INDU-TRANSDUCTIVE training strategy that treats speed as a transductive, network-wide signal while learning flow inductively to generalize to unseen locations. HINT couples (i) an inductive spatial transformer that learns similarity-driven, long-range interactions from node features with (ii) a diffusion GCN conditioned by FiLM on rich static context (OSM-derived attributes and traffic simulation), and (iii) a node-wise calibration layer that corrects scale biases per segment. Training uses masked reconstruction with epoch-wise node sampling, hard-node mining to emphasize difficult sensors, and noise injection on visible flows to prevent identity mapping, while graph structure is built from driving distances.\n  Across three real-world datasets, MOW (Antwerp, Belgium), UTD19-Torino, and UTD19-Essen, HINT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inductive baselines.

In conventional thermodynamic trade-off relations, the quantities of interest are linear in the underlying probability distribution. Some important information-theoretic quantities, such as Rényi entropies, are nonlinear; however, such nonlinearities are generally more difficult to handle. Inspired by replica techniques used in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we construct Markovian dynamics of identical replicas and derive a lower bound on relative moments in terms of the dynamical activity. We apply our general result to two scenarios. First, for a random walker on a network, we derive an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the position distribution of the walker, which quantifies the extent of diffusion on the network. Remarkably, the bound is expressed solely in terms of escape rate from the initial node, and thus depends only on local information. Second, we consider trajectory observables in Markov processes and obtain an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the distribution of these observables, again in terms of the dynamical activity. This provides an entropic characterization of uncertainty that generalizes existing variance-based thermodynamic uncertainty relations."}

In particular, with the rise of these approaches, studies have shown that users exhibit different POI choices in their familiar and unfamiliar areas, highlighting the importance of incorporating user familiarity into predictive models. However, existing methods often fail to distinguish between the movements of users in familiar and unfamiliar regions. To address this, we propose MoE-TransMov, a Transformer-based model with a Transformer model with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to use one framework to capture distinct mobility patterns across different moving contexts without requiring separate training for certain data. Using user-check-in data, we classify movements into familiar and unfamiliar categories and develop a specialized expert network to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach integrates self-attention mechanisms and adaptive gating networks to dynamically select the most relevant expert models for different mobility contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets, including the widely used but small open-source Foursquare NYC dataset and the large-scale Kyoto dataset collected with LY Corporation (Yahoo Japan Corporation), show that MoE-TransMov outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with notable improvements in Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 accuracy, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR).

Most existing vision models rely on purely data-driven learning and produce black-box predictions with limited interpretability and poor cross-domain generalization, hindering their real-world clinical adoption. We present NEURO-GUARD, a novel knowledge-guided vision framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs) with language-driven reasoning to improve performance, transparency, and domain robustness. NEURO-GUARD employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism for self-verification, in which a large language model (LLM) iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines feature-extraction code for medical images. By grounding this process in clinical guidelines and expert knowledge, the framework progressively enhances feature detection and classification beyond purely data-driven baselines. Extensive experiments on diabetic retinopathy classification across four benchmark datasets APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, and Messidor-2 demonstrate that NEURO-GUARD improves accuracy by 6.2% over a ViT-only baseline (84.69% vs. 78.4%) and achieves a 5% gain in domain generalization. Additional evaluations on MRI-based seizure detection further confirm its cross-domain robustness, consistently outperforming existing methods.\n  Overall, NEURO-GUARD bridges symbolic medical reasoning with subsymbolic visual learning, enabling interpretable, knowledge-aware, and generalizable medical image diagnosis while achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets."}

We propose the use of two distinct quantum annealer sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals, and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau. Remarkably, we find that fast quench-like anneals can quickly generate ensemble distributions that are very good estimates of the true partition function of the classical Ising model; on a Pegasus graph-structured QPU we report a logarithmic relative error of $7.6 \\times 10^{-6}$, from $171,000$ samples generated using $0.2$ seconds of QPU time with an anneal time of $8$ nanoseconds per sample which is interestingly within the closed system dynamics timescale of the superconducting qubits."}

To explain the experimental results, previous mean-field studies have explored its thermal phase transitions, identifying armchair phases and striped phases, but their limitations call for more reliable numerical investigations. In this work, we systematically revisit the classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We find that the armchair (AC) phase, previously reported in mean-field and experimental studies, actually coexists with the spiral (SP) phase, with their combined degeneracy reaching 20-fold (4-fold for the AC states and 16-fold for the spiral states). The phase transitions and critical exponents are studied at different interaction values. We observe first-order phase transitions, continuous phase transitions, and even the multipeak phenomenon, i.e., Schottky-like specific-heat anomalies in frustrated systems.

Federated Learning (FL), in which raw data never leaves local devices, has shown promise in overcoming these limitations. Although FL has grown rapidly in recent years, it still struggles with heterogeneity, which produces gradient noise, client-drift, and increased variance from partial client participation. In this paper, we propose FedOAED, a novel federated learning algorithm designed to mitigate client-drift arising from multiple local training updates and the variance induced by partial client participation.

The approach first translates text into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), then refines the logic via an unsupervised Critic Tree, and finally transforms the output into executable production rules compatible with symbolic cognitive frameworks. Based on the resulted rules, a cognitive agent is further constructed and optimized through cognitive reinforcement learning according to the real-world behavioral data. Our method is validated in two domains: (1) NL-to-LTL translation, where our CriticNL2LTL module achieves consistent performance across both expert and large-scale benchmarks without human-in-the-loop feed-backs, and (2) cognitive driving simulation, where agents automatically constructed from human interviews have successfully learned the diverse decision patterns of about 70 trials in different critical scenarios.

In this work we present a systematic set of integral equations (with no functional derivatives) - Hedin approximations I, II, III, IV etc. - whose solutions converge to the solutions of the exact Hedin equations. The Hedin approximations are well suited to iterative numerical solutions (which we also describe). Furthermore Hedin approximation I is just the GW approximation (as such this work may be viewed as a systematic improvement of the GW approximation). We present a systematic study of the Hedin equations for zero dimensional field theory (which, in particular, is a method to enumerate Feynman diagrams for field theories in arbitrary dimensions) and show better and better convergence to the solutions of the Hedin equations for higher and higher Hedin approximations, with Hedin approximations I, II and III being explicitly studied. We, in particular, show that the higher Hedin approximations capture more and and more Feynman diagrams for the self energy. We also show that already Hedin approximation II captures more diagrams than the state of the art diagrammatic vertex corrections approach. Furthermore Hedin approximation III is a near perfect match to the exact solutions of the Hedin equations, at least in the zero dimensional case, and enumerates a large number of Feynman diagrams."}

For large effective Hilbert space, the roughness time mean depends more on the effective space than the initial state. While the Wigner function is dominated by the non-diagonal terms, the overlap operator has some contribution on each part, but it is more affected by the diagonal terms than the density matrix."}

As these systems are increasingly deployed in critical areas, ensuring their privacy and alignment with human values is paramount. Recently, selective forgetting (also known as machine unlearning) has shown promise for privacy and data removal tasks, and has emerged as a transformative paradigm shift in the field of AI. It refers to the ability of a model to selectively erase the influence of previously seen data, which is especially important for compliance with modern data protection regulations and for aligning models with human values. Despite its promise, selective forgetting raises significant privacy concerns, especially when the data involved come from sensitive domains. While new unlearning-induced privacy attacks are continuously proposed, each is shown to outperform its predecessors using different experimental settings, which can lead to overly optimistic and potentially unfair assessments that may disproportionately favor one particular attack over the others. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating privacy vulnerabilities in selective forgetting. We extensively investigate privacy vulnerabilities of machine unlearning techniques and benchmark privacy leakage across a wide range of victim data, state-of-the-art unlearning privacy attacks, unlearning methods, and model architectures. We systematically evaluate and identify critical factors related to unlearning-induced privacy leakage. With our novel insights, we aim to provide a standardized tool for practitioners seeking to deploy customized unlearning applications with faithful privacy assessments."}

Yet, most architectures remain static and reactive, tethered to manually defined, narrow scenarios. These systems excel at perception (System 1) and deliberation (System 2) but lack a persistent meta-layer to maintain identity, verify reasoning, and align short-term actions with long-term survival. We first propose a third stratum, System 3, that presides over the agent's narrative identity and long-horizon adaptation. The framework maps selected psychological constructs to concrete computational modules, thereby translating abstract notions of artificial life into implementable design requirements. The ideas coalesce in Sophia, a \"Persistent Agent\" wrapper that grafts a continuous self-improvement loop onto any LLM-centric System 1/2 stack. Sophia is driven by four synergistic mechanisms: process-supervised thought search, narrative memory, user and self modeling, and a hybrid reward system. Together, they transform repetitive reasoning into a self-driven, autobiographical process, enabling identity continuity and transparent behavioral explanations. Although the paper is primarily conceptual, we provide a compact engineering prototype to anchor the discussion. Quantitatively, Sophia independently initiates and executes various intrinsic tasks while achieving an 80% reduction in reasoning steps for recurring operations. Notably, meta-cognitive persistence yielded a 40% gain in success for high-complexity tasks, effectively bridging the performance gap between simple and sophisticated goals. Qualitatively, System 3 exhibited a coherent narrative identity and an innate capacity for task organization. By fusing psychological insight with a lightweight reinforcement-learning core, the persistent agent architecture advances a possible practical pathway toward artificial life."}

The exponential cost renders the study of the thermodynamic properties of such systems out of equilibrium intractable and forces approximations of system noise or assumptions of continuous particle numbers. Here, we use tensor networks to numerically explore the thermodynamics of chemical processes by directly solving the ensemble solution of the chemical master equation with efficient (sub-exponential) computational cost. We provide accurate estimates of the entropy production rate, heat flux, chemical work, and nonequilibrium thermodynamic potentials, free from sampling errors or mean-field approximations. We illustrate our results through a dissipative self-assembly model. In this way, we show how tensor networks can inform the design of efficient chemical processes in previously unattainable regimes."}

Most existing approaches rely on deterministic embeddings or black-box predictive models, offering limited uncertainty quantification and little insight into what latent representations encode. We propose a probabilistic digital twin framework in which each user is modeled as a latent stochastic state that generates observed behavioral data. The digital twin is learned via amortized variational inference, enabling scalable posterior estimation while retaining a fully probabilistic interpretation. We instantiate this framework using a variational autoencoder (VAE) applied to a user-response dataset designed to capture stable aspects of user identity. Beyond standard reconstruction-based evaluation, we introduce a statistically grounded interpretation pipeline that links latent dimensions to observable behavioral patterns. By analyzing users at the extremes of each latent dimension and validating differences using nonparametric hypothesis tests and effect sizes, we demonstrate that specific dimensions correspond to interpretable traits such as opinion strength and decisiveness. Empirically, we find that user structure is predominantly continuous rather than discretely clustered, with weak but meaningful structure emerging along a small number of dominant latent axes. These results suggest that probabilistic digital twins can provide interpretable, uncertainty-aware representations that go beyond deterministic user embeddings."}

To address these issues, we propose MSC-180, a benchmark for evaluation based on the MSC2020 mathematical subject classification. It comprises 180 formal verification problems, 3 advanced problems from each of 60 mathematical branches, spanning from undergraduate to graduate levels. Each problem has undergone multiple rounds of verification and refinement by domain experts to ensure formal accuracy. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers under the pass@32 setting reveal that the best model achieves only an 18.89% overall pass rate, with prominent issues including significant domain bias (maximum domain coverage 41.7%) and a difficulty gap (significantly lower pass rates on graduate-level problems). To further quantify performance variability across mathematical domains, we introduce the coefficient of variation (CV) as an evaluation metric. The observed CV values are 4-6 times higher than the statistical high-variability threshold, indicating that the models still rely on pattern matching from training corpora rather than possessing transferable reasoning mechanisms and systematic generalization capabilities. MSC-180, together with its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, provides a discriminative and systematic benchmark for driving the development of next-generation AI systems with genuine mathematical reasoning abilities."}

Here we analytically determine the mean escape time and splitting probabilities for an arbitrary heterogeneous diffusion in an arbitrary three-dimensional domain with small targets that can be perfectly or imperfectly absorbing. Our analysis reveals general principles for how search depends on heterogeneous diffusion and its interpretation (e.g. Itô, Stratonovich, or kinetic). An intricate picture emerges in which, for instance, increasing the diffusivity can decrease, not affect, or even increase the escape time.

The stochastic analytic continuation method is used to determine the dynamic structure factor from correlation functions in imaginary time obtained by QMC. In contrast to the \"roton minimum\" of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we find that magnons on the honeycomb lattice completely decay in the corner of the Brillouin zone ($K$-point); the entire weight is shifted into the continuum. These findings are fully supported by SE and CST in momentum space. The extrapolated one-magnon dispersion obtained from SE about the Ising limit quantitatively agrees with the extracted QMC excitation energies except around the $K$-point, where large uncertainties in the extrapolation indicate the magnon decay. This quantum decay is further confirmed and understood by the CST, which yields a divergent flow when enforcing a magnon quasi-particle picture. The divergence originates from strong attractive magnon-magnon interactions leading to a bound state and thereby to a three-magnon continuum overlapping with the one-magnon state. This has the magnon quasi-particle picture break down at high energies on the honeycomb lattice."}

Monitoring the chain-of-thought (CoT) of today's reasoning models has proven effective for detecting misbehavior. However, this \"monitorability\" may be fragile under different training procedures, data sources, or even continued system scaling. To measure and track monitorability, we propose three evaluation archetypes (intervention, process, and outcome-property) and a new monitorability metric, and introduce a broad evaluation suite. We demonstrate that these evaluations can catch simple model organisms trained to have obfuscated CoTs, and that CoT monitoring is more effective than action-only monitoring in practical settings. We compare the monitorability of various frontier models and find that most models are fairly, but not perfectly, monitorable. We also evaluate how monitorability scales with inference-time compute, reinforcement learning optimization, and pre-training model size. We find that longer CoTs are generally more monitorable and that RL optimization does not materially decrease monitorability even at the current frontier scale. Notably, we find that for a model at a low reasoning effort, we could instead deploy a smaller model at a higher reasoning effort (thereby matching capabilities) and obtain a higher monitorability, albeit at a higher overall inference compute cost. We further investigate agent-monitor scaling trends and find that scaling a weak monitor's test-time compute when monitoring a strong agent increases monitorability. Giving the weak monitor access to CoT not only improves monitorability, but it steepens the monitor's test-time compute to monitorability scaling trend. Finally, we show we can improve monitorability by asking models follow-up questions and giving their follow-up CoT to the monitor."}

Inherent to the Hall measurement geometry, the measured signal is often contaminated by unwanted contributions, so the data must be processed to isolate the Hall response. The standard approach invokes Onsager-Casimir reciprocity and antisymmetrizes the raw signal about zero applied magnetic field. In hysteretic materials this becomes nontrivial, since Onsager-Casimir relations apply only to microscopically reversible states. Incorrect antisymmetrization can lead to artifacts that mimic anomalous or topological Hall signatures. The situation is especially subtle when hysteresis loops are not centered at zero applied field, as in exchange-biased systems. A practical reference for generically extracting the Hall response in hysteretic materials is lacking. Here, using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a bulk single-crystal model that can be prepared with or without exchange-biased hysteresis, we demonstrate two procedures that can be used to extract the Hall effect: (1) reverse-magnetic-field reciprocity and (2) antisymmetrization with respect to applied field. We then measure the Hall effect on CeCoGe$_3$, a noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet which can be prepared to have asymmetric magnetization and magnetoresistance, and demonstrate how improper processing can generate artificial anomalous Hall signals.

Based on a factorized self-attention architecture, TraCeR estimates the hazard function from a sequence of measurements, naturally capturing temporal covariate interactions without assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. The framework is inherently designed to handle censored data and competing events. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that TraCeR achieves substantial and statistically significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our evaluation extends beyond discrimination metrics and assesses model calibration, addressing a key oversight in literature."}

The core idea is to make structure the carrier of explanations: an image is encoded as an attributed graph (critical points and lines represented as nodes with geometric attributes), and generalization is achieved via the formation of concept attractors (class-level concept graphs). Purpose. To design and experimentally validate an architecture in which class concepts are formed from a handful of examples (5 - 6 per class) through structural and parametric reductions, providing transparent decisions and eliminating backpropagation. Methods. Contour vectorization is followed by constructing a bipartite graph (Point/Line as nodes) with normalized geometric attributes such as coordinates, length, angle, and direction; reductions include the elimination of unstable substructures or noise and the alignment of paths between critical points. Concepts are formed by iterative composition of samples, and classification is performed by selecting the best graph-to-concept match (using approximated GED). Results. On an MNIST subset with 5 - 6 base examples per class (single epoch), we obtain a consistent accuracy of around 82% with full traceability of decisions: misclassifications can be explained by explicit structural similarities. An indicative comparison with SVM, MLP, CNN, as well as metric and meta-learning baselines, is provided. The structural-graph scheme with concept attractors enables few-shot learning without backpropagation and offers built-in explanations through the explicit graph structure. Limitations concern the computational cost of GED and the quality of skeletonization; promising directions include classification-algorithm optimization, work with static scenes, and associative recognition."}

However, as organized crime groups are becoming more professional in real-world scenarios, fraudsters are employing more sophisticated camouflage strategies. Specifically, fraudsters disguise themselves by mimicking the behavioral data collected by platforms, ensuring that their key characteristics are consistent with those of benign users to a high degree, which we call Adaptive Camouflage. Consequently, this narrows the differences in behavioral traits between them and benign users within the platform's database, thereby making current GFD models lose efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a relation diffusion-based graph augmentation model Grad. In detail, Grad leverages a supervised graph contrastive learning module to enhance the fraud-benign difference and employs a guided relation diffusion generator to generate auxiliary homophilic relations from scratch. Based on these, weak fraudulent signals would be enhanced during the aggregation process, thus being obvious enough to be captured. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets provided by WeChat Pay, one of the largest online payment platforms with billions of users, and three public datasets. The results show that our proposed model Grad outperforms SOTA methods in both various scenarios, achieving at most 11.10% and 43.95% increases in AUC and AP, respectively.

Continuous surveillance of predictive model outputs offers a safe and reliable approach for identifying such distributional shifts without ground truth labels. However, most existing methods rely on centralized monitoring of aggregated predictions, overlooking site-specific drift dynamics. We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification. These findings suggest that adaptive, site-aware agent-based drift monitoring can enhance reliability of multisite clinical decision support systems."}

We propose the use of two distinct quantum annealer sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals, and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau.

This paper proposes a post-hoc ITD framework that integrates explicit and implicit graph representations with temporal modelling to capture complex user behaviour patterns. An explicit graph is constructed using predefined organisational rules to model direct relationships among user activities. To mitigate noise and limitations in this hand-crafted structure, an implicit graph is learned from feature similarities using the Gumbel-Softmax trick, enabling the discovery of latent behavioural relationships. Separate Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) process the explicit and implicit graphs to generate node embeddings, which are concatenated and refined through an attention mechanism to emphasise threat-relevant features. The refined representations are then passed to a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies in user behaviour. Activities are flagged as anomalous when their probability scores fall below a predefined threshold. Extensive experiments on CERT r5.2 and r6.2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On r5.2, the model achieves an AUC of 98.62, a detection rate of 100%, and a false positive rate of 0.05.

In the linear optical response, in contrast, single-particle and collective-mode contributions overlap. With increasing electron-phonon coupling, the amplitude mode contribution to 2DCS initially remains robust, but then drops rapidly and remains small in the phonon-dominated regime -- even in systems with large order parameter. 2DCS also aids the detection of the massive relative phase mode, which is analogous to the Leggett mode in superconductors. Our analysis, based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, demonstrates that 2DCS can track the emergence of the symmetry-broken state and the crossover from Coulomb-driven to phonon-driven order."}

Individual fairness has garnered traction in graph representation learning due to its practical importance in high-stakes Web areas such as user modeling, recommender systems, and search. However, existing methods assume the existence of predefined similarity information over all node pairs, an often unrealistic requirement that prevents their operationalization in practice. In this paper, we assume the similarity information is only available for a limited subset of node pairs and introduce FairExpand, a flexible framework that promotes individual fairness in this more realistic partial information scenario. FairExpand follows a two-step pipeline that alternates between refining node representations using a backbone model (e.g., a graph neural network) and gradually propagating similarity information, which allows fairness enforcement to effectively expand to the entire graph. Extensive experiments show that FairExpand consistently enhances individual fairness while preserving performance, making it a practical solution for enabling graph-based individual fairness in real-world applications with partial similarity information."}

Prior studies mainly focus on static tasks and overlook the online adaptation required when beliefs must be continuously updated, which is a key capability for LLMs acting as world models or agents. We introduce a Bayesian filtering framework to evaluate online inference in LLMs. Our probabilistic probe suite spans both multivariate discrete distributions, such as dice rolls, and continuous distributions, such as Gaussian processes, where ground-truth parameters shift over time. We find that while LLM belief updates resemble Bayesian posteriors, they are more accurately characterized by an exponential forgetting filter with a model-specific discount factor smaller than one. This reveals systematic discounting of older evidence that varies significantly across model architectures. Although inherent priors are often miscalibrated, the updating mechanism itself remains structured and principled. We further validate these findings in a simulated agent task and propose prompting strategies that effectively recalibrate priors with minimal computational cost."}

These methods are often constrained by the complexity of preparing the block-encoded state, the overhead associated with the required ancillary qubits, or the challenging problem of angle synthesis for the polynomial's phase factors, which limits the achievable circuit depth and overall efficiency.\n  In this work, we propose a novel and resource-efficient approach to implement arbitrary polynomials of a Hermitian matrix, by leveraging the Generalized Quantum Signal Processing (GQSP) framework. Our method circumvents the need for block-encoding by expressing the target Hermitian matrix as a symmetric combination of unitary conjugates, enabling polynomial synthesis via GQSP circuits applied to each unitary component. We derive closed-form expressions for symmetric polynomial expansions and demonstrate how linear combinations of GQSP circuits can realize the desired transformation. This approach reduces resource overhead, and opens new pathways for quantum algorithm design for functions of Hermitian matrices."}

While more efficient single-rollout variants have recently been explored in text-only settings, we find that they suffer from severe instability in multimodal contexts, often leading to training collapse. To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance. MSSR achieves this via an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes, preventing collapse and maintaining training stability. While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that MSSR enables stable, compute-efficient, and effective RLVR for complex multimodal reasoning tasks."}

However, when facing ambiguous natural language instructions (e.g., \"fetch the tool\" in a cluttered room), current agents often fail to balance the high cost of physical exploration against the cognitive cost of human interaction. They typically treat disambiguation as a passive perception problem, lacking the strategic reasoning to minimize total task execution costs. To bridge this gap, we propose ESearch-R1, a cost-aware embodied reasoning framework that unifies interactive dialogue (Ask), episodic memory retrieval (GetMemory), and physical navigation (Navigate) into a single decision process. We introduce HC-GRPO (Heterogeneous Cost-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization). Unlike traditional PPO which relies on a separate value critic, HC-GRPO optimizes the MLLM by sampling groups of reasoning trajectories and reinforcing those that achieve the optimal trade-off between information gain and heterogeneous costs (e.g., navigate time, and human attention). Extensive experiments in AI2-THOR demonstrate that ESearch-R1 significantly outperforms standard ReAct-based agents. It improves task success rates while reducing total operational costs by approximately 50\\%, validating the effectiveness of GRPO in aligning MLLM agents with physical world constraints."}

In this context, the present work considers the derivation of linear and quadratic Casimir operators corresponding to representations of the Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT) group associated with a five-dimensional spacetime of signature (1,4). This LCT group, which emerges naturally as the symmetry group of the relativistic quantum phase space, is isomorphic to the symplectic group Sp(2,8). The latter notably contains the de Sitter group SO(1,4) as a subgroup. This geometric setting provides a unified framework for extending the Standard Model of particle physics while incorporating cosmological features. Previous studies have shown that the LCT group admits both fermionic-like and bosonic-like representations. Within this framework, a novel classification of quarks and leptons, including sterile neutrinos, has also been proposed. In this work, we present a systematic derivation of the linear and quadratic Casimir operators associated with these representations, motivated by their fundamental role in the characterization of symmetry groups in physics. The construction is based on the relations between the LCT group and the pseudo-unitary group U(1,4). Three linears and three quadratics Casimir operators are identified: two corresponding to the fermionic-like representation, two to the bosonic-like representation, and two hybrid operators linking the two representations.

In this paper, we uncover the striking data saturation in offline behavioral data: policy performance rapidly saturates when trained on a small fraction of the dataset. We attribute this effect to the weak alignment between policy performance and test loss, revealing substantial room for improvement through data selection. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective method, Stepwise Dual Ranking (SDR), which extracts a compact yet informative subset from large-scale offline behavioral datasets. SDR is build on two key principles: (1) stepwise clip, which prioritizes early-stage data; and (2) dual ranking, which selects samples with both high action-value rank and low state-density rank. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that SDR significantly enhances data selection for offline behavioral data."}

However, this strategy discards incomplete reasoning paths and wastes partial computation.\n  We propose reflective confidence, a novel reasoning framework that transforms low-confidence signals from termination indicators into reflection triggers. When confidence falls below a threshold, instead of stopping generation, the model produces a reflection prompt to analyze the current reasoning state, identify potential errors, and continue generation along a corrected trajectory. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME 2025, demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over advanced early-stopping baselines at comparable computational cost, validating the effectiveness of proactive self-correction over passive discarding."}

LoRA trains two ``adapter\" matrices that form a low-rank representation of the model parameters, thereby massively reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated at every step. Although LoRA is simple, its convergence is poorly understood due to the lack of Lipschitz smoothness, a key condition for classic convergence analyses. As a result, current theoretical results only consider asymptotic behavior or assume strong boundedness conditions which artificially enforce Lipschitz smoothness. In this work, we provide for the first time a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the \\textit{original LoRA gradient descent} algorithm, which reflects widespread practice, without such assumptions. Our work relies on three key steps: i) reformulating the problem in terms of the outer product of the stacked adapter matrices, ii) a modified descent lemma for the ``Lipschitz-like\" reparametrized function, and iii) controlling the step size.

Traditional methods often fall short, relying on static and largely qualitative models that do not scale with system complexity and fail to capture systemic interdependencies. In this work, we introduce a novel quantitative approach to cyber risk assessment based on Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), a formulation compatible with both classical computing and quantum annealing. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach using a realistic 255-nodes layered infrastructure, showing how risk spreads in non-trivial patterns that are difficult to identify through visual inspection alone. To assess scalability, we further conduct extensive experiments on networks up to 1000 nodes comparing classical, quantum, and hybrid classical-quantum workflows. Our results reveal that although quantum annealing produces solutions comparable to classical heuristics, its potential advantages are significantly hindered by the embedding overhead required to map the densely connected cyber-risk QUBO onto the limited connectivity of current quantum hardware. By contrast, hybrid quantum-classical solvers avoid this bottleneck and therefore emerge as a promising option, combining competitive scaling with an improved ability to explore the solution space and identify more stable risk configurations. Overall, this work delivers two main advances. First, we present a rigorous, tunable, and generalizable mathematical model for cyber risk that can be adapted to diverse infrastructures and domains through flexible parameterization.

We propose that chunking mechanisms play an essential role and show how the CogAct computational model grounds concept learning in fundamental cognitive processes and structures (such as chunking, attention, STM and LTM). First are the in-principle demonstrations, with CogAct automatically adapting to learn a range of categories from simple logical functions, to artificial categories, to natural raw (as opposed to natural pre-processed) concepts in the dissimilar domains of literature, chess and music. This kind of adaptive learning is difficult for most other psychological models, e.g., with cognitive models stopping at modelling artificial categories and (non-GPT) models based on deep learning requiring task-specific changes to the architecture. Secondly, we offer novel ways of designing human benchmarks for concept learning experiments and simulations accounting for subjectivity, ways to control for individual human experiences, all while keeping to real-life complex categories. We ground CogAct in simulations of subjective conceptual spaces of individual human participants, capturing humans subjective judgements in music, with the models learning from raw music score data without bootstrapping to pre-built knowledge structures. The CogAct simulations are compared to those obtained by a deep-learning model. These findings integrate concept learning and adaptation to complexity into the broader theories of cognitive psychology. Our approach may also be used in psychological applications that move away from modelling the average participant and towards capturing subjective concept space."}

We introduce IntelliCode, a multi-agent LLM tutoring system built around a centralized, versioned learner state that integrates mastery estimates, misconceptions, review schedules, and engagement signals. A StateGraph Orchestrator coordinates six specialized agents: skill assessment, learner profiling, graduated hinting, curriculum selection, spaced repetition, and engagement monitoring, each operating as a pure transformation over the shared state under a single-writer policy. This architecture enables auditable mastery updates, proficiency-aware hints, dependency-aware curriculum adaptation, and safety-aligned prompting.\n  The demo showcases an end-to-end tutoring workflow: a learner attempts a DSA problem, receives a conceptual hint when stuck, submits a corrected solution, and immediately sees mastery updates and a personalized review interval. We report validation results with simulated learners, showing stable state updates, improved task success with graduated hints, and diverse curriculum coverage. IntelliCode demonstrates how persistent learner modeling, orchestrated multi-agent reasoning, and principled instructional design can be combined to produce transparent and reliable LLM-driven tutoring."}

However, it remains unknown from a computational perspective how information about others' rewards affects the evaluation of one's own reward. With a constructive approach, this study examines whether monkeys merely recognize objective reward differences or, instead, infer others' subjective reward valuations. We developed three computational models with varying degrees of social information processing: an Internal Prediction Model (IPM), which infers the partner's subjective values; a No Comparison Model (NCM), which disregards partner information; and an External Comparison Model (ECM), which directly incorporates the partner's objective rewards. To test model performance, we used a multi-layered, multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation. We trained the models on a dataset containing the behavior of a pair of monkeys, their rewards, and the conditioned stimuli. Then, we evaluated the models' ability to classify subjective values across pre-defined experimental conditions. The ECM achieved the highest classification score in the Rand Index (0.88 vs. 0.79 for the IPM) under our settings, suggesting that social comparison relies on objective reward differences rather than inferences about subjective states."}

A key prerequisite for scalable quantum chemistry, however, is size consistency: the energy of non-interacting subsystems must scale linearly with system size. While many algorithms are theoretically size-consistent, noise on quantum devices may couple nominally independent subsystems and degrade this fundamental property. Here, we systematically evaluate size consistency on quantum hardware by simulating systems composed of increasing numbers of non-interacting H$_{2}$ molecules using optimally shallow unitary circuits. We find that molecular energies remain size-consistent within chemical accuracy for an estimated 118 and 71 H$_{2}$ subsystems for one- and two-qubit unitary designs, respectively, demonstrating that current quantum devices preserve size consistency over chemically relevant system sizes and supporting the feasibility of scalable, noise-resilient simulation of strongly correlated molecules and materials."}

While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants have become the de facto standard for training deep networks, their success in these over-parameterized regimes often appears more empirical than principled. This thesis investigates this apparent paradox by tracing the evolution of optimization algorithms from classical first-order methods to modern higher-order techniques, revealing how principled algorithmic design can demystify the training process. Starting from first principles with SGD and adaptive gradient methods, the analysis progressively uncovers the limitations of these conventional approaches when confronted with anisotropy that is representative of real-world data. These breakdowns motivate the exploration of sophisticated alternatives rooted in curvature information: second-order approximation techniques, layer-wise preconditioning, adaptive learning rates, and more. Next, the interplay between these optimization algorithms and the broader neural network training toolkit, which includes prior and recent developments such as maximal update parametrization, learning rate schedules, and exponential moving averages, emerges as equally essential to empirical success. To bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical deployment, this paper offers practical prescriptions and implementation strategies for integrating these methods into modern deep learning workflows."}

Furthermore, we design an NIG-distance-based attention mechanism to model the dynamic evolution of the knowledge state.

Second, we propose three practical algorithms: a one-shot baseline, a greedy sequential method, and a look-ahead sequential method. Using a real-world credit-scoring dataset with gradually arriving alternative data, we show that (i) optimal switching times vary systematically with cost parameters and learning-curve behavior, and (ii) the look-ahead sequential method outperforms other methods and is able to approach in value an oracle with full foresight.

Most models of learning and inference, however, presuppose a fixed representational basis within which belief updating occurs. In this paper, I address a prior question: under what structural conditions can the representational basis itself expand in a principled and selective way?\n  I propose a geometric framework in which conceptual growth is modeled as admissible basis extension evaluated under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Experience, whether externally observed or internally simulated, is represented as vectors relative to a current conceptual subspace. Residual components capture systematic representational failure, and candidate conceptual extensions are restricted to low-rank, admissible transformations. I show that any MDL-accepted extension can be chosen so that its novel directions lie entirely within the residual span induced by experience, while extensions orthogonal to this span strictly increase description length and are therefore rejected.\n  This yields a conservative account of imagination and conceptual innovation. Internally generated counterfactual representations contribute to learning only insofar as they expose or amplify structured residual error, and cannot introduce arbitrary novelty. I further distinguish representational counterfactuals--counterfactuals over an agent's conceptual basis--from causal or value-level counterfactuals, and show how MDL provides a normative selection principle governing representational change.\n  Overall, the framework characterizes conceptual development as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process of basis extension, clarifying both the role and the limits of imagination in learning and theory change."}

While existing jailbreak studies explore both single-turn and multi-turn strategies, most implicitly assume a static safety boundary and fail to account for how contextual interactions dynamically influence model behavior, leading to limited stability and generalization. Motivated by this gap, we propose MEEA (Mere Exposure Effect Attack), a psychology-inspired, fully automated black-box framework for evaluating multi-turn safety robustness, grounded in the mere exposure effect. MEEA leverages repeated low-toxicity semantic exposure to induce a gradual shift in a model's effective safety threshold, enabling progressive erosion of alignment constraints over sustained interactions. Concretely, MEEA constructs semantically progressive prompt chains and optimizes them using a simulated annealing strategy guided by semantic similarity, toxicity, and jailbreak effectiveness. Extensive experiments on both closed-source and open-source models, including GPT-4, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate that MEEA consistently achieves higher attack success rates than seven representative baselines, with an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) improvement exceeding 20%. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of both annealing-based optimization and contextual exposure mechanisms. Beyond improved attack effectiveness, our findings indicate that LLM safety behavior is inherently dynamic and history-dependent, challenging the common assumption of static alignment boundaries and highlighting the need for interaction-aware safety evaluation and defense mechanisms.

The proposed method constructs a qubit-efficient image representation by first applying a cartographic generalization algorithm to a classical edge-extracted input image, yielding a highly optimized sparse-dot based geometric description. While ensuring the structural integrity of the image, this sparse representation is then embedded into the atomic configuration of Aquila (QuEra Computing Inc.), modeled through the Bloqade simulation software stack. By encoding visual information through physical atom placement rather than digital basis-state coding, the approach avoids the costly state-preparation overhead inherent to digital quantum image processing circuits. Additionally, pruning sparse dot images, akin to map feature reduction, compresses representations without fidelity loss, thereby substantially reducing qubit requirements when implemented on an analog neutral-atom quantum device. The resulting quantum-native images have been successfully evaluated through matching tasks against an image database, thus illustrating the feasibility of this approach for image matching applications. Since sparse-dot image representations enable seamless generation of synthetic datasets, this work constitutes an initial step towards fully quantum-native machine-learning pipelines for visual data and highlights the potential of scalable analog quantum computing to enable resource-efficient alternatives to energy-intensive classical AI-based image processing frameworks."}

However, existing expert pruning approaches conventionally rely on local importance metrics and often apply uniform layer-wise pruning, leveraging only partial evaluation signals and overlooking the heterogeneous contributions of experts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose an expert pruning approach based on the trajectory of activated experts across layers, which treats MoE as a weighted computation graph and casts expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem. Within this framework, we integrate complementary importance signals from reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength at the trajectory level, which naturally yields non-uniform expert retention across layers. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior pruning performance on nearly all tasks compared with most existing approaches."}

Astonishingly, standard analyses of the time reported brain regions predictive of social emotions. The explanation, of course, was not supernatural cognition but a cautionary tale about misapplied statistical inference. In AI interpretability, reports of similar ''dead salmon'' artifacts abound: feature attribution, probing, sparse auto-encoding, and even causal analyses can produce plausible-looking explanations for randomly initialized neural networks. In this work, we examine this phenomenon and argue for a pragmatic statistical-causal reframing: explanations of computational systems should be treated as parameters of a (statistical) model, inferred from computational traces. This perspective goes beyond simply measuring statistical variability of explanations due to finite sampling of input data; interpretability methods become statistical estimators, and findings should be tested against explicit and meaningful alternative computational hypotheses, with uncertainty quantified with respect to the postulated statistical model. It also highlights important theoretical issues, such as the identifiability of common interpretability queries, which we argue is critical to understand the field's susceptibility to false discoveries, poor generalizability, and high variance. More broadly, situating interpretability within the standard toolkit of statistical inference opens promising avenues for future work aimed at turning AI interpretability into a pragmatic and rigorous science."}

However, problems of practical relevance typically have more variables than current or foreseeable quantum computers have qubits. Here we introduce a divide and conquer approach that partitions the optimization problem into subgraphs that can be represented on smaller quantum processors. We then find all states of the subgraphs that can possibly be part of the solution to the entire problem by determining the cost or energy ranges in which the local subgraph energies of these states must be contained. This allows us to reduce the problem by only considering the subspace spanned by these states. We then recombine the system using a binary encoding for each subgraph with a local energy ordering. This process can be iterated until no further reduction is possible. We also find that the number of necessary qubits can be reduced further when only retaining states in a fraction of the relevant energy range at very little expense in terms of approximation ratio to the global ground state. In numerical simulations, we find that our approach allows us to solve combinatorial optimization problems on weighted random 3-regular graphs with $|\\mathcal{V}|=40$ discrete variables on $\\sim |\\mathcal{V}| / 4$ qubits while retaining a possible approximation ratio of $\\sim99.9\\%$.

We introduce CORE (Concept-Oriented REinforcement), an RL training framework that turns explicit concepts into a controllable supervision signal. Starting from a high-quality, low-contamination textbook resource that links verifiable exercises to concise concept descriptions, we run a sanity probe showing LLMs can restate definitions but fail concept-linked quizzes, quantifying the conceptual reasoning gap. CORE then (i) synthesizes concept-aligned quizzes, (ii) injects brief concept snippets during rollouts to elicit concept-primed trajectories, and (iii) reinforces conceptual reasoning via trajectory replacement after group failures, a lightweight forward-KL constraint that aligns unguided with concept-primed policies, or standard GRPO directly on concept-aligned quizzes.

However, it faces a critical barrier in the modern era of low precision computing: numerical instability. As tiles scale to maximize efficiency (e.g., F(6,3), F(8,3)), the condition numbers of standard integer based transforms explode, reaching kappa = 2 x 10^5 for F(8,3), rendering them unusable in FP16 or Int8. We introduce NOVA (Numerical Optimization of Vandermonde Arithmetic), a discovery framework that breaks the decades old convention of integer interpolation. Treating Winograd point selection as a continuous optimization problem, NOVA searches the manifold R^n-1 via Evolution Strategy, snaps candidates to simple rationals, and guarantees correctness via symbolic verification. This process uncovers a hidden landscape of stable, fractional configurations such as {+-5/6, +-7/6, +-3/5} that defy traditional vocabulary constraints. The impact is transformative: NOVA improves the conditioning of F(8,3) by 415x in 1D, which squares to a 172,484x improvement for 2D convolution. In real world FP16 ImageNet inference, where standard transforms collapse to random chance (e.g., 4.7 percent accuracy on VGG16), NOVA's points restore full accuracy (75 to 78 percent), recovering over 70 percentage points without retraining, calibration, or learned parameters. These discovered transforms act as drop in replacements, effectively unlocking the efficiency of large tile Winograd convolution for next generation hardware."}

Reliable deployment therefore requires robust OOD detection, yet this is particularly challenging for irregular 3D graphs that combine continuous geometry with categorical identities and are unordered by construction. Here, we present a probabilistic OOD detection framework for complex 3D graph data built on a diffusion model that learns a density of the training distribution in a fully unsupervised manner. A key ingredient we introduce is a unified continuous diffusion over both 3D coordinates and discrete features: categorical identities are embedded in a continuous space and trained with cross-entropy, while the corresponding diffusion score is obtained analytically via posterior-mean interpolation from predicted class probabilities. This yields a single self-consistent probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) that produces per-sample log-likelihoods, providing a principled typicality score for distribution shift. We validate the approach on protein-ligand complexes and construct strict OOD datasets by withholding entire protein families from training. PF-ODE likelihoods identify held-out families as OOD and correlate strongly with prediction errors of an independent binding-affinity model (GEMS), enabling a priori reliability estimates on new complexes. Beyond scalar likelihoods, we show that multi-scale PF-ODE trajectory statistics - including path tortuosity, flow stiffness, and vector-field instability - provide complementary OOD information. Modeling the joint distribution of these trajectory features yields a practical, high-sensitivity detector that improves separation over likelihood-only baselines, offering a label-free OOD quantification workflow for geometric deep learning."}

Unlike traditional data-driven models, our approach does not require training data, supports inference with incomplete information, and is robust to noisy or uncertain observations. We report performance for two missions involving 11 and 9 casualties, respectively, where our Bayesian network model substantially outperformed vision-only baselines during evaluation of our system in the DARPA Triage Challenge (DTC) field scenarios.

Small, near-term quantum processors are now available, but existing work rarely shows whether quantum components can improve end-to-end detection under these unstable, resource constrained conditions rather than just adding complexity. We address this gap with a hybrid architecture that uses a compact multilayer perceptron to compress security data and then routes a few features to 2-4 qubit quantum heads implemented as quantum support vector machines and variational circuits. Under matched preprocessing and training budgets, we benchmark these hybrids against tuned classical baselines on two security tasks, network intrusion detection on NSL-KDD and spam filtering on Ling-Spam datasets, and then deploy the best 4-qubit quantum SVM to an IBM Quantum device with noise-aware execution (readout mitigation and dynamical decoupling). Across both datasets, shallow quantum heads consistently match, and on difficult near-boundary cases modestly reduce, missed attacks and false alarms relative to classical models using the same features. Hardware results track simulator behavior closely enough that the remaining gap is dominated by device noise rather than model design. Taken together, the study shows that even on small, noisy chips, carefully engineered quantum components can already function as competitive, budget-aware elements in practical threat detection pipelines."}

Emphasis is placed on how SOM handles multidimensional data and uncovers hidden patterns to support effective water management.

First, we introduce a new benchmark suite of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions constructed by fusing the properties of both dynamic and multimodal optimization to establish a rigorous evaluation platform. Second, we propose a novel algorithm centered on a Clustering-based Autoencoder prediction dynamic response mechanism, which utilizes an autoencoder model to process matched clusters to generate a highly diverse initial population. Furthermore, to balance the algorithm's convergence and diversity, we integrate an adaptive niching strategy into the static optimizer. Empirical analysis on 12 instances of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions reveals that, compared with several state-of-the-art dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, our algorithm not only preserves population diversity more effectively in the decision space but also achieves superior convergence in the objective space."}

Recently, it was shown that quantum nonlocality can be certified even under a simultaneous arbitrary (but not full) relaxation of the assumptions of Measurement Independence (MI) and Parameter Independence (PI), using states of local dimension $d = poly((1-ε)^{-1})$ for an $ε\\in [0,1)$-relaxation. Here, we derive three results strengthening the state-of-art. Firstly, we show that states of constant local dimension $d$ are already sufficient to certify quantum nonlocality under arbitrary MI and PI relaxation, albeit in a non-robust manner. Secondly, and as a theoretical paradigm to derive the above, we introduce the notion of \\textit{measurement-dependent parameter-dependent locality} as the set of input-output behaviors under simultaneous relaxations of measurement and parameter independence. We provide a rigorous characterisation of the vertices of the polytope of joint input-output behaviors that obey a $μ$-relaxation of MI and $ε$-relaxation of PI. We highlight a relation between nonlocality certification under PI relaxation and that under detection inefficiencies by pointing out alternative extremal correlations to the Eberhard correlations that also allow to achieve detection efficiency of $η= 2/3$ in the two-input scenario. Finally, we study the implication of the relaxed assumptions for device-independent randomness certification. We analytically derive the quantum guessing probability for one player's outcomes in the CHSH Bell test, as a function of the noise in the test as well as of a leakage of an average amount of $I(X:B) < 1$ bits of input information per measurement round."}

When experience is represented as a linear trajectory in Euclidean space, the geodesic distance between temporal events grows linearly with time, forcing the required covering number to diverge. In fixed-dimensional hardware, this volume expansion inevitably forces trajectory overlap, manifesting as catastrophic interference. In this work, we propose a geometric resolution to this paradox based on Recursive Metric Contraction. We formalize abstraction not as symbolic grouping, but as a topological deformation: a quotient map that collapses the metric tensor within validated temporal neighborhoods, effectively driving the diameter of local sub-manifolds to zero. We substantiate our framework with four rigorous results. First, the Bounded Capacity Theorem establishes that recursive quotient maps allow the embedding of arbitrarily long trajectories into bounded representational volumes, trading linear metric growth for logarithmic topological depth. Second, the Topological Collapse Separability Theorem, derived via Urysohn's Lemma, proves that recursive quotienting renders non-linearly separable temporal sequences linearly separable in the limit, bypassing the need for infinite-dimensional kernel projections. Third, the Parity-Partitioned Stability Theorem solves the catastrophic forgetting problem by proving that if the state space is partitioned into orthogonal flow and scaffold manifolds, the metric deformations of active learning do not disturb the stability of stored memories. Our analysis reveals that tokens in neural architectures are physically realizable as singularities or wormholes, regions of extreme positive curvature that bridge distant points in the temporal manifold."}

To this end, in this paper, we propose SynSelect, a novel three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework for generating high-quality long CoT data tailored to multimodal reasoning tasks. Specifically, SynSelect first leverages multiple heterogeneous multimodal LRMs to produce diverse candidate CoTs, and then applies both instance and batch level selection to filter high-quality CoTs that can effectively enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models supervised fine-tuned on SynSelect-generated data significantly outperform baselines and achieve further improvements after reinforcement learning post-training.

Interestingly in an MDQN, the inseparability of two subsystems underlying entanglement can occur both between multiple distinct photons as well as between individual degrees of freedom associated with a single photon. In this work, we investigate the entanglement transfer enabled by the interplay of both entanglement between two distinct photons as well as inseparability between multiple degrees of freedom.

This study applies machine learning techniques to link drought indices with historical drought impact records (2005:2024) to generate short-term impact forecasts. By addressing key conceptual and data-driven challenges regarding temporal scale and impact quantification, the study aims to improve the predictability of drought impacts at actionable lead times.

Results indicate that Fire and Relief impacts were predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by Agriculture and Water, while forecasts for Plants and Society impacts showed greater variability. County and state level forecasts for New Mexico were produced using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that incorporated both DSCI and ESI. The model successfully generated forecasts up to eight weeks in advance using the preceding eight weeks of data for most impact categories.

This paper investigates the classification of synthetic graph families using a hybrid approach that combines GNNs with engineered graph-theoretic features. We generate a large and structurally diverse synthetic dataset comprising graphs from five representative generative families, Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, Barab'asi-Albert, Holme-Kim, and Stochastic Block Model. These graphs range in size up to 1x10^4 nodes, containing up to 1.1x10^5 edges. A comprehensive range of node and graph level features is extracted for each graph and pruned using a Random Forest based feature selection pipeline. The features are integrated into six GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, GATv2, GIN, GraphSAGE and GTN. Each architecture is optimised for hyperparameter selection using Optuna. Finally, models were compared against a baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained solely on the handcrafted features. Our evaluation demonstrates that GraphSAGE and GTN achieve the highest classification performance, with 98.5% accuracy, and strong class separation evidenced by t-SNE and UMAP visualisations. GCN and GIN also performed well, while GAT-based models lagged due to limitations in their ability to capture global structures.

Furthermore, we introduce inference-time scaling to enhance performance by dynamically adjusting the steering intensity which has resulted in a 7-15\\% of accuracy improvement for Qwen3-0.6B."}

In this work, we apply QRC within a hybrid quantum classical framework for image denoising. The quantum reservoir is implemented using a Rydberg atom array, while a classical neural network serves as the readout layer. To prepare the input, images are first compressed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), reducing their dimensionality to match the size of the atom array. Each feature vector is encoded into local detuning parameters of a time-dependent Hamiltonian governing the Rydberg system. As the system evolves, it generates nonlinear embeddings through the measurement of observables across multiple time steps. These temporal embeddings capture complex correlations, which are fed into a classical neural network to reconstruct the denoised images. To evaluate performance, we compare this QRC-assisted model against a baseline architecture consisting of PCA followed by a dense neural network, trained under identical conditions. Our results show that the QRC-based approach achieves improved image sharpness and similar structural recovery compared to the PCA-based model. We demonstrate the practical viability of this framework through experiments on QuEra's Aquila neutral-atom processor, leveraging its programmable atom arrays to physically realize the reservoir dynamics."}

Evaluating the dynamics in such models is key to understanding their learned generative mechanisms. However, such evaluation is impeded by two major challenges: First, comparison of learned dynamics across models is difficult because there is no enforced equivalence of their coordinate systems. Second, identification of mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs (e.g., limit sets) is intractable in high-dimensional nonlinear models such as RNNs. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to address these two issues, termed Diffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models (DFORM). DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems, which aligns their trajectories in a maximally one-to-one manner. In so doing, DFORM enables an assessment of whether two models exhibit topological equivalence, i.e., similar mechanisms despite differences in coordinate systems. A byproduct of this method is a means to locate dynamical motifs on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within higher-dimensional systems. We verified DFORM's ability to identify linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations using canonical topologically equivalent systems, RNNs, and systems related by nonlinear flows. DFORM was also shown to provide a quantification of similarity between topologically distinct systems. We then demonstrated that DFORM can locate important dynamical motifs including invariant manifolds and saddle limit sets within high-dimensional models. Finally, using a set of RNN models trained on human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings, we illustrated that DFORM can identify limit cycles from high-dimensional data-driven models, which agreed well with prior numerical analysis."}

Both learning networks and knowledge graph representations can meaningfully coexist to preserve different aspects of data. While vectorized data are useful for probabilistic estimation, graphs preserve the intentionality of the source even under data fractionation. Using a Semantic Spacetime $γ(3,4)$ graph, one avoids complex ontologies in favour of classification of features by their roles in semantic processes.

It is shown that depending on the dissipation strength there is a regime when the eigenstates of density matrix are localized at a strong or moderate dissipation. At a weak dissipation the eigenstates are argued to be delocalized being linked to the Ehrenfest explosion of quantum wave packet. This phenomenon is related with the Lyapunov exponent and Ehrenfest time for the quantum strange attractor.

To bridge this critical gap, we present REALM (REalistic AI Learning for Multiphysics), a rigorous benchmarking framework designed to test neural surrogates on challenging, application-driven reactive flows. REALM features 11 high-fidelity datasets spanning from canonical multiphysics problems to complex propulsion and fire safety scenarios, alongside a standardized end-to-end training and evaluation protocol that incorporates multiphysics-aware preprocessing and a robust rollout strategy. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark over a dozen representative surrogate model families, including spectral operators, convolutional models, Transformers, pointwise operators, and graph/mesh networks, and identify three robust trends: (i) a scaling barrier governed jointly by dimensionality, stiffness, and mesh irregularity, leading to rapidly growing rollout errors; (ii) performance primarily controlled by architectural inductive biases rather than parameter count; and (iii) a persistent gap between nominal accuracy metrics and physically trustworthy behavior, where models with high correlations still miss key transient structures and integral quantities. Taken together, REALM exposes the limits of current neural surrogates on realistic multiphysics flows and offers a rigorous testbed to drive the development of next-generation physics-aware architectures."}

While acknowledging the power of long reasoning chains, we cannot help but wonder: Why do different reasoning chains perform differently in reasoning? What components of the reasoning chains play a key role? Existing studies mainly focus on evaluating reasoning chains from a functional perspective, with little attention paid to their structural mechanisms. To address this gap, this work is the first to analyze and evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from a structural perspective. We apply persistent homology from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to map reasoning steps into semantic space, extract topological features, and analyze structural changes. These changes reveal semantic coherence, logical redundancy, and identify logical breaks and gaps. By calculating homology groups, we assess connectivity and redundancy at various scales, using barcode and persistence diagrams to quantify stability and consistency. Our results show that the topological structural complexity of reasoning chains correlates positively with accuracy. More complex chains identify correct answers sooner, while successful reasoning exhibits simpler topologies, reducing redundancy and cycles, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.

Experiments performed on QuEra's Aquila quantum processor are benchmarked against large-scale coherent emulations using the Juelich Quantum Annealing Simulator (JUQAS), enabling the controlled inclusion of realistic hardware imperfections. In the ideal coherent limit, a tunable longitudinal field induces confinement of domain-wall excitations into mesonic bound states, leading to a progressive truncation of the correlation light cone. When experimentally relevant inhomogeneities and fluctuations are included, correlations instead saturate at finite distance even in the nominally deconfined regime, revealing localization driven by emergent disorder. The close quantitative agreement between noisy emulations and experimental data allows us to attribute the observed saturation to specific hardware error channels and to identify the dominant contribution. Our results establish a practical framework for diagnosing and modeling error-induced localization in Rydberg quantum processors, while demonstrating that confinement remains a robust and programmable mechanism for engineering non-ergodic dynamics on near-term quantum hardware."}

In this work, we treat interactions as the fundamental units of such structure and investigate a largely unexplored question: how DNNs encode interactions under different levels of contextual complexity, and how these microscopic interaction patterns shape macroscopic representation capacity. To quantify this complexity, we use multi-order interactions [57], where each order reflects the amount of contextual information required to evaluate the joint interaction utility of a variable pair. This formulation enables a stratified analysis of cooperative patterns learned by DNNs. Building on this formulation, we develop a comprehensive study of interaction structure in DNNs. (i) We empirically discover a universal interaction bottleneck: across architectures and tasks, DNNs easily learn low-order and high-order interactions but consistently under-represent mid-order ones. (ii) We theoretically explain this bottleneck by proving that mid-order interactions incur the highest contextual variability, yielding large gradient variance and making them intrinsically difficult to learn. (iii) We further modulate the bottleneck by introducing losses that steer models toward emphasizing interactions of selected orders. Finally, we connect microscopic interaction structures with macroscopic representational behavior: low-order-emphasized models exhibit stronger generalization and robustness, whereas high-order-emphasized models demonstrate greater structural modeling and fitting capability. Together, these results uncover an inherent representational bias in modern DNNs and establish interaction order as a powerful lens for interpreting and guiding deep representations."}

The B2 agent family is robust to the same latent perturbation; this robustness persists in a Self-Model-off / workspace-read control, cautioning against attributing the effect solely to $z_{\\text{self}}$ compression. We also report an explicit negative result: raw perturbational complexity (PCI-A) decreases under the workspace bottleneck, cautioning against naive transfer of IIT-adjacent proxies to engineered agents. These results suggest a hierarchical design principle: GWT provides broadcast capacity, while HOT provides quality control. We emphasize that our agents are not conscious; they are reference implementations for testing functional predictions of consciousness theories."}

However, existing all-optical quantum communication protocols either require complicated quantum error correction steps for logical-qubit recoveries at every few kilometers or, over larger quantum repeater segments, they would at least depend on sharing complex multi-photon entangled states. Here we propose an all-optical memory-based quantum repeater for long-distance quantum communication, with quantum memories at each repeater station realized in the form of fiber loops combined with suitable quantum error correction codes for photon-loss protection. By sending only single-photon states through the fibers connecting the stations, such repeaters can operate in the classical infrastructure's long-segment regime.

Focusing on the core independence issue under covariance stationarity, this paper aims to provide a first-principles analysis of the Expectation of Optimization Bias (EOB), formalizing it information-theoretically as the discrepancy between the true joint distribution and its flawed i.i.d. counterpart. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigm paradox: the more deterministic and structured the time series, the more severe the bias by point-wise loss function. We derive the first closed-form quantification for the non-deterministic EOB across linear and non-linear systems, and prove EOB is an intrinsic data property, governed exclusively by sequence length and our proposed Structural Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR). This theoretical diagnosis motivates our principled debiasing program that eliminates the bias through sequence length reduction and structural orthogonalization. We present a concrete solution that simultaneously achieves both principles via DFT or DWT. Furthermore, a novel harmonized $\\ell_p$ norm framework is proposed to rectify gradient pathologies of high-variance series.

As a running example, we focus on Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), which, despite its apparent simplicity, requires sequential reasoning, adaptation, and strategy recognition. Our system positions the LLM as an Observer whose task is to identify which strategies are being played and to articulate the reasoning behind this judgment. The purpose is not to test knowledge of Rock-Paper-Scissors itself, but to probe whether the model can exhibit mind-like reasoning about sequential behavior. To support systematic evaluation, we provide a benchmark consisting of both static strategies and lightweight dynamic strategies specified by well-prompted rules. We quantify alignment between the Observer's predictions and the ground-truth distributions induced by actual strategy pairs using three complementary signals: Cross-Entropy, Brier score, and Expected Value (EV) discrepancy. These metrics are further integrated into a unified score, the Union Loss, which balances calibration, sensitivity, and payoff alignment. Together with a Strategy Identification Rate (SIR) metric, our framework captures not only predictive accuracy but also whether the model can stably identify the latent strategies in play. The demo emphasizes interactivity, transparency, and reproducibility. Users can adjust LLM distributions in real time, visualize losses as they evolve, and directly inspect reasoning snippets to identify where and why failures occur. In doing so, our system provides a practical and interpretable proxy for mind-like inference in sequential games, offering insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM reasoning."}

Here we show that chaos enables switchable eigenstate resources: avoided crossings in soft- versus strong- chaos windows selectively realize an entanglement-peak mode or a coherence-peak mode within the same system. Crucially, this chaos-controlled inversion is not tied to a particular notion of subsystems, appearing both in single-wave settings and in genuine many-body settings. From the quantum-chaos perspective, conventional diagnostics based on avoided-crossing phenomenology and eigenmode delocalization are insufficient; eigenfunction entanglement and basis coherence provide the missing discriminants. Using two wave-chaotic billiards and a tilted-field Ising chain, we track the information-theoretic response of eigenstates across localized hybridization windows. Even when avoided-crossing phenomenology and delocalization are comparable, the entanglement and coherence responses invert between soft- and strong-chaos regimes. In the Ising chain, a single microscopic knob, the global field tilt, toggles between the two operating modes and reveals a trade-off in which off-diagonal correlations grow as diagonal populations dip. Our diagnostics require only reduced states (or their spectra) and are compatible with mode imaging in wave-chaos resonators and randomized measurements in programmable spin simulators."}

This disentanglement is achieved by enforcing analogical consistency in the embedding space to ensure the semantic transformation of adding an attribute (e.g., a length constraint) remains invariant across different problem contexts. This enables our model to reuse invariant semantics across trained variants and construct representations for unseen combinations. ARC achieves state-of-the-art performance across in-distribution, zero-shot generalization, few-shot adaptation, and real-world benchmarks."}

One approach involves the use of plausibility checks, rule-based procedures that assess the correctness and internal consistency of data, to detect anomalies or signs of manipulation. Although these verification procedures are essential for ensuring data integrity, existing plausibility checks are manually implemented by software engineers, which is time-consuming. Recent advances in code generation with large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating and scaling the generation of these checks. However, adapting LLMs to the specific requirements of an unknown domain remains a significant challenge. This work investigates the extent to which LLMs, adapted on domain-specific code and data through different fine-tuning strategies, can generate rule-based plausibility checks for forgery detection on constrained hardware resources. We fine-tune open-source LLMs, Llama 3.1 8B and OpenCoder 8B, on structured datasets derived from real-world application scenarios and evaluate the generated plausibility checks on previously unseen forgery patterns. The results demonstrate that the models are capable of generating executable and effective verification procedures. This also highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable tools to support human decision-making in security-sensitive contexts where comprehensibility is required."}

This framework elucidates universal scaling behaviors, including the characteristic $q^{-1/3}$ entanglement scaling with noise probability $q$ and distinct timescales for information protection. We further highlight a broad range of constructions and applications inspired by noisy monitored circuits, spanning variational quantum algorithms, classical simulation methods, mixed-state phases of matter, and emerging approaches to quantum error mitigation and quantum error correction.

In this work, we study how the choice of pretraining data distribution steers a shallow transformer toward one behavior or the other. Focusing on a minimal trigger-output prediction task -- copying the token immediately following a special trigger upon its second occurrence -- we present a rigorous analysis of gradient-based training of a single-layer transformer. In both the infinite and finite sample regimes, we prove a transition in the learned mechanism: if input sequences exhibit sufficient diversity, measured by a low ``max-sum'' ratio of trigger-to-trigger distances, the trained model implements an induction head and generalizes to unseen contexts; by contrast, when this ratio is large, the model resorts to a positional shortcut and fails to generalize out-of-distribution (OOD). We also reveal a trade-off between the pretraining context length and OOD generalization, and derive the optimal pretraining distribution that minimizes computational cost per sample. Finally, we validate our theoretical predictions with controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating that broadening context distributions robustly induces induction heads and enables OOD generalization. Our results shed light on the algorithmic biases of pretrained transformers and offer conceptual guidelines for data-driven control of their learned behaviors."}

Food couriers naturally operate under long-horizon objectives (maximizing net profit over hours) while managing diverse constraints, e.g., delivery deadline, transportation expense, vehicle battery, and necessary interactions with other couriers and customers.

We extend this universal concept to non-Hermitian systems by defining topological chirality, an invariant that emerges whenever an exceptional-points (EP) pair is present. Built from the non-commutative fundamental group and its braid representation, topological chirality acts as a singularity selector: clockwise EP loops occupy a homotopy class that avoids EPs, whereas counter-clockwise mirrors are equivalent only if they cross the EPs themselves. We confirm this binary rule in an optical microcavity and a non-Hermitian topological band. The same two-sheeted topology governs EP pairs in spin systems, photonic crystals and hybrid light-matter structures, where EP encirclements have already been demonstrated, so the framework transfers without alteration and confirms its experimental viability. Our findings lay the cornerstone for interpreting loop-sensitive observables such as spectral vorticity, the complex Berry phase and the non-Abelian holonomy.

Existing methods primarily address the stability-plasticity dilemma through mechanisms where past knowledge influences optimization but rarely affects the agent's behavior directly, which may hinder effective knowledge reuse and efficient learning. In contrast, we propose demonstration-guided continual reinforcement learning (DGCRL), which stores prior knowledge in an external, self-evolving demonstration repository that directly guides RL exploration and adaptation. For each task, the agent dynamically selects the most relevant demonstration and follows a curriculum-based strategy to accelerate learning, gradually shifting from demonstration-guided exploration to fully self-exploration. Extensive experiments on 2D navigation and MuJoCo locomotion tasks demonstrate its superior average performance, enhanced knowledge transfer, mitigation of forgetting, and training efficiency. The additional sensitivity analysis and ablation study further validate its effectiveness."}

On this basis, a multi-scale graph semantic aggregation module is introduced to achieve semantic consistency modeling of scheduling features through local adjacency semantic integration and global topology alignment, thereby strengthening the model's capability to capture abnormal features in complex scenarios such as multi-task concurrency, resource competition, and stage transitions. Experiments are conducted on a real scheduling dataset with multiple scheduling disturbance paths set to simulate different types of anomalies, including structural shifts, resource changes, and task delays. The proposed model demonstrates significant performance advantages across multiple metrics, showing a sensitive response to structural disturbances and semantic shifts.

To overcome this limitation, recent works adopt diffusion models to produce new risky samples beyond the coverage of existing datasets. However, these methods struggle in the conformity between generated samples and expected categories, which could introduce label noise and severely limit their effectiveness in applications. To address this issue, we propose RiskyDiff that incorporates the embeddings of both texts and images as implicit constraints of category conformity. We also design a conformity score to further explicitly strengthen the category conformity, as well as introduce the mechanisms of embedding screening and risky gradient guidance to boost the risk of generated samples.

Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate plausible hidden confounders based on domain knowledge, yet a critical gap exists: LLM-generated confounders often exhibit semantic plausibility without statistical utility. We propose VIGOR+ (Variational Information Gain for iterative cOnfounder Refinement), a novel framework that closes the loop between LLM-based confounder generation and CEVAE-based statistical validation. Unlike prior approaches that treat generation and validation as separate stages, VIGOR+ establishes an iterative feedback mechanism: validation signals from CEVAE (including information gain, latent consistency metrics, and diagnostic messages) are transformed into natural language feedback that guides subsequent LLM generation rounds. This iterative refinement continues until convergence criteria are met. We formalize the feedback mechanism, prove convergence properties under mild assumptions, and provide a complete algorithmic framework."}

This trade-off enforces a correlated behavior of phase and Fourier entropies near avoided crossings and exceptional points, precisely where the Petermann factor diverges and phase rigidity collapses. Our results establish biorthogonality is not as an anomaly but an intrinsic property of eigenfunctions, arising universal manifestation of uncertainty relation in non-Hermitian systems.

Given that interference effects introduce unpredictability in scheduling, neglecting them may compromise SLO or deadline satisfaction. Nevertheless, existing interference prediction approaches remain limited in several respects, which may restrict their usefulness for scheduling. First, they are often coarse-grained, which ignores runtime co-location dynamics and thus restricts their accuracy in interference prediction. Second, they tend to use a static prediction model, which may not effectively cope with different workload characteristics.

To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, \\textit{PENDULUM}, comprising approximately 2,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering pairs specifically designed to elicit sycophantic responses. The benchmark spans six distinct image domains of varying complexity, enabling a systematic investigation of how image type and inherent challenges influence sycophantic tendencies. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs. we observe substantial variability in model robustness and a pronounced susceptibility to sycophantic and hallucinatory behavior. Furthermore, we propose novel metrics to quantify sycophancy in visual reasoning, offering deeper insights into its manifestations across different multimodal contexts.

On the other, we analyse the joint probability distributions associated with sequential measurements of the walker's position, assessing their violation of the classical Kolmogorov consistency conditions via a dedicated quantifier $\\bar{K}(t)$. We demonstrate a quadratic short-time scaling of $\\bar{K}(t)$, which differs from the known linear scaling of $D_{\\mathrm{QC}}(t)$, but, as the latter, is fully determined by the degree of the initially occupied node and is independent of the global graph topology. At longer times, instead, $\\bar{K}(t)$ exhibits a pronounced topology-driven behavior: it is strongly suppressed on complete graphs while remaining finite and oscillatory on cycles, in contrast with the almost topology-independent asymptotics of $D_{\\mathrm{QC}}(t)$. We then extend the analysis to Markovian open-system dynamics, focusing on dephasing in the position basis (Haken-Strobl model) and in the energy basis (intrinsic decoherence). Site dephasing drives both quantifiers to zero, with the decay of $\\bar{K}(t)$ controlled by the spectral gap of the corresponding Lindblad generator. By contrast, energy-basis dephasing preserves a finite asymptotic value of $\\bar{K}(t)$, depending on the overlap structure of the Laplacian eigenspaces with the site basis."}

The question is how to learn goal-conditioned and general policies when the training instances are large and the goal cannot be reached by random exploration alone. The technique of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) provides an answer to this question: it relabels unsuccessful trajectories as successful ones by replacing the original goal with one that was actually achieved. If the target policy must generalize across states and goals, trajectories that do not reach the original goal states can enable more data- and time-efficient learning. In this work, we show that further performance gains can be achieved when states and goals are represented by sets of atoms. We consider three versions: goals as full states, goals as subsets of the original goals, and goals as lifted versions of these subgoals. The result is that the latter two successfully learn general policies on large planning instances with sparse rewards by automatically creating a curriculum of easier goals of increasing complexity. The experiments illustrate the computational gains of these versions, their limitations, and opportunities for addressing them."}

The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize."}

A fundamental challenge in observational data is that while we need to infer outcome differences under alternative treatments, we can only observe each individual's outcome under a single treatment. Existing approaches address this limitation either by training with inferred pseudo-outcomes or by creating matched instance pairs. However, recent work has largely overlooked the potential impact of post-treatment variables on the outcome. This oversight prevents existing methods from fully capturing outcome variability, resulting in increased variance in counterfactual predictions. This paper introduces Pseudo-outcome Imputation with Post-treatment Variables for Counterfactual Regression (PIPCFR), a novel approach that incorporates post-treatment variables to improve pseudo-outcome imputation. We analyze the challenges inherent in utilizing post-treatment variables and establish a novel theoretical bound for ITE risk that explicitly connects post-treatment variables to ITE estimation accuracy. Unlike existing methods that ignore these variables or impose restrictive assumptions, PIPCFR learns effective representations that preserve informative components while mitigating bias. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate that PIPCFR achieves significantly lower ITE errors compared to existing methods."}

This digital ''amnesia'' results in sub-optimal performance, repeated errors, and poor generalization to novel challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoTrail-GUI, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like experiential learning by equipping agents with a dynamic, accessible memory. Our framework operates in three distinct stages. First, during Experience Exploration, an agent autonomously interacts with GUI environments to build a curated database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model. Crucially, the entire knowledge base construction is thus fully automated, requiring no human supervision. Second, in the Memory Injection stage, upon receiving a new task, our system efficiently retrieves the most relevant past trajectories to serve as actionable ''memories''. Finally, during GUI Task Inference, these memories are injected as in-context guidance to inform the agent's reasoning and decision-making process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on benchmarks including Android World and AndroidLab. The results show that EchoTrail-GUI significantly improves the task success rate and operational efficiency of baseline agents, validating the power of structured memory in creating more robust and intelligent GUI automation."}

This paper introduces a label-informed outlier detection method for heterogeneous data based on Granular Computing and Fuzzy Sets, namely Granule Density-based Outlier Factor (GDOF). Specifically, GDOF first employs label-informed fuzzy granulation to effectively represent various data types and develops granule density for precise density estimation. Subsequently, granule densities from individual attributes are integrated for outlier scoring by assessing attribute relevance with a limited number of labeled outliers. Experimental results on various real-world datasets show that GDOF stands out in detecting outliers in heterogeneous data with a minimal number of labeled outliers. The integration of Fuzzy Sets and Granular Computing in GDOF offers a practical framework for outlier detection in complex and diverse data types.

Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video observations. To address this, we present QuantiPhy, the first benchmark designed to quantitatively measure a VLM's physical reasoning ability. Comprising more than 3.3K video-text instances with numerical ground truth, QuantiPhy evaluates a VLM's performance on estimating an object's size, velocity, and acceleration at a given timestamp, using one of these properties as an input prior. The benchmark standardizes prompts and scoring to assess numerical accuracy, enabling fair comparisons across models. Our experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent gap between their qualitative plausibility and actual numerical correctness. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key factors like background noise, counterfactual priors, and strategic prompting and find that state-of-the-art VLMs lean heavily on pre-trained world knowledge rather than faithfully using the provided visual and textual inputs as references when reasoning kinematic properties quantitatively.

Each ensemble member is generated from a compact latent tensor (5 MB), enabling perfect reproducibility and post-inference spread adjustment through latent rescaling. Evaluation on 2022 ERA5 reanalysis shows ensembles with spread-skill ratios approaching unity and rank histograms that progressively flatten toward uniformity through medium-range forecasts, achieving calibration competitive with operational IFS-ENS.

However, many quantum algorithms require deep quantum circuits, which are challenging to implement on current noisy devices. To address this limitation, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been actively developed, enabling practical quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Among them, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) stands out as a leading approach for solving problems in quantum chemistry, many-body physics, and even integer factorization. The VQE algorithm can be implemented on various quantum hardware platforms, including photonic systems, quantum dots, trapped ions, neutral atoms, and superconducting circuits. In particular, photonic platforms offer several advantages: they operate at room temperature, exhibit low decoherence, and support multiple degrees of freedom, making them suitable for scalable, high-dimensional quantum computation. Here we present methodologies for realizing VQE on photonic systems, highlighting their potential for practical quantum computing. We first provide a theoretical overview of the VQE framework, focusing on the procedure for variationally estimating ground state energies. We then explore how photonic systems can implement these processes, showing that a wide variety of problems can be addressed using either multiple qubit states or a single qudit state."}

Here, we present a Sagnac-loop integrated system (SLIS) that, for the first time, combines ring-based quantum key distribution (QKD) with fiber-based weak measurement (WM) enhanced sensing and disturbance localization capabilities. In the event of communication interruption due to external disturbances, the SLIS seamlessly switches to perception system, employing interference measurement and WM techniques to monitor channel disturbances. By integrating null-frequencies localization (NFL) mode, the system precisely determines the disturbance location, enabling rapid identification of security vulnerabilities along the link. Experimental results demonstrate that, over a 30 km Sagnac loop channel, the SLIS achieves a raw key generation rate of 22.4 kbps with stable operation and clear scalability toward network expansion. In terms of perception performance, the SLIS exhibits strong capability for both dynamic and quasi-static disturbances. For dynamic perturbations, the system detects transient impacts and PZT-driven frequency variations down to 100 Hz, and enables long-distance localization via NFL alignment, with improved localization performance as the disturbance position moves farther away along the loop. For quasi-static disturbances, gravitational changes as small as 100 g are resolved, corresponding to a time-delay variation of 9.81 as. This work provides a novel technical pathway toward self-diagnosing, robust quantum networks through integrated communication and sensing functionalities."}

The current standard for evaluating this capability is MedCalc-Bench, a large-scale dataset constructed using LLM-based feature extraction and rule-based aggregation. However, treating such model-generated benchmarks as static oracles risks enshrining historical model errors as evaluation gold standards, a problem dangerously amplified when these datasets serve as reward signals for Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose viewing benchmarks for complex tasks such as clinical score computation as ''in-progress living documents'' that should be periodically re-evaluated as the processes for creating them improve. We introduce a systematic, physician-in-the-loop pipeline that leverages advanced agentic verifiers to audit and relabel MedCalc-Bench, utilizing automated triage to reserve scarce clinician attention for the most contentious instances. Our audit reveals that a notable fraction of original labels diverge from medical ground truth due to extraction errors, calculator logic mismatches, and clinical ambiguity. To study whether this label noise meaningfully impacts downstream RL training, we fine-tune a Qwen3-8B model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and demonstrate that training on corrected labels yields an 8.7% absolute improvement in accuracy over the original baseline -- validating that label noise materially affects model evaluation. These findings underscore that in safety-critical domains, rigorous benchmark maintenance is a prerequisite for genuine model alignment."}

Accurate prediction of LC mortality rates is crucial for guiding targeted interventions and addressing health disparities. Although traditional regression-based models have been commonly used, explainable machine learning models may offer enhanced predictive accuracy and deeper insights into the factors influencing LC mortality. This study applied three models: random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and linear regression (LR) to predict county-level LC mortality rates across the United States. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values were used to determine variable importance and their directional impact. Geographic disparities in LC mortality were analyzed through Getis-Ord (Gi*) hotspot analysis. The RF model outperformed both GBR and LR, achieving an R2 value of 41.9% and an RMSE of 12.8. SHAP analysis identified smoking rate as the most important predictor, followed by median home value and the percentage of the Hispanic ethnic population. Spatial analysis revealed significant clusters of elevated LC mortality in the mid-eastern counties of the United States. The RF model demonstrated superior predictive performance for LC mortality rates, emphasizing the critical roles of smoking prevalence, housing values, and the percentage of Hispanic ethnic population. These findings offer valuable actionable insights for designing targeted interventions, promoting screening, and addressing health disparities in regions most affected by LC in the United States."}

Here we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, reactive near-field subwavelength imaging of microwave fields using the quantum non-demolition properties of Rydberg atoms, realized with a compact, non-invasive single-ended fibre-integrated Rydberg probe engineered to minimize field disturbance. The probe achieves an imaging resolution of {\\unboldmath$λ/56$}, and the measured field distributions agree with full-wave simulations with structural similarity approaching unity, confirming both its subwavelength spatial resolution and its genuinely non-invasive character compared with conventional metal-based probes. Because the atomic sensor is intrinsically isotropic, the same device can faithfully image multi-dimensional field structures without orientation-dependent calibration.

We systematically investigate the interplay between quantization precision (FP16, INT8, INT4) and replay buffer strategies in large language models, revealing unexpected dynamics. While FP16 achieves superior initial task performance (74.44% on NLU), we observe a striking inversion on subsequent tasks: quantized models outperform FP16 by 8-15% on final task forward accuracy, with INT4 achieving nearly double FP16's performance on Code generation (40% vs 20%). Critically, even minimal replay buffers (0.1%) dramatically improve retention - increasing NLU retention after Math training from 45% to 65% across all precision levels - with INT8 consistently achieving the optimal balance between learning plasticity and knowledge retention. We hypothesize that quantization-induced noise acts as implicit regularization, preventing the overfitting to new task gradients that plagues high-precision models. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that higher precision is always preferable, suggesting instead that INT8 quantization offers both computational efficiency and superior continual learning dynamics.

We propose an adaptation framework built upon a Masked Autoencoder backbone and evaluate its performance under a Leave-One-Dataset-Out validation protocol across five open HAR datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that both LoRA and QLoRA can match the recognition performance of full fine-tuning while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, memory usage, and training time.

We propose HINT, a Hybrid INductive-Transductive Network, and an INDU-TRANSDUCTIVE training strategy that treats speed as a transductive, network-wide signal while learning flow inductively to generalize to unseen locations. HINT couples (i) an inductive spatial transformer that learns similarity-driven, long-range interactions from node features with (ii) a diffusion GCN conditioned by FiLM on rich static context (OSM-derived attributes and traffic simulation), and (iii) a node-wise calibration layer that corrects scale biases per segment. Training uses masked reconstruction with epoch-wise node sampling, hard-node mining to emphasize difficult sensors, and noise injection on visible flows to prevent identity mapping, while graph structure is built from driving distances.\n  Across three real-world datasets, MOW (Antwerp, Belgium), UTD19-Torino, and UTD19-Essen, HINT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inductive baselines.

We overcome these limitations by proposing an online DR-RL algorithm with general function approximation that learns an optimal robust policy purely through interaction with the environment, without requiring prior models or offline data, enabling deployment in high-dimensional tasks.

However, as organized crime groups are becoming more professional in real-world scenarios, fraudsters are employing more sophisticated camouflage strategies. Specifically, fraudsters disguise themselves by mimicking the behavioral data collected by platforms, ensuring that their key characteristics are consistent with those of benign users to a high degree, which we call Adaptive Camouflage. Consequently, this narrows the differences in behavioral traits between them and benign users within the platform's database, thereby making current GFD models lose efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a relation diffusion-based graph augmentation model Grad. In detail, Grad leverages a supervised graph contrastive learning module to enhance the fraud-benign difference and employs a guided relation diffusion generator to generate auxiliary homophilic relations from scratch. Based on these, weak fraudulent signals would be enhanced during the aggregation process, thus being obvious enough to be captured. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets provided by WeChat Pay, one of the largest online payment platforms with billions of users, and three public datasets.

Our approach is based on a novel lag operator, which geometrically derives the discrete-time recurrence by measuring how the system's basis functions \"slide\" and change from one timestep to the next. The resulting state matrices are computed via a single inner product involving this operator, offering a modular design space for creating novel SSMs by flexibly combining different basis functions and time-warping schemes. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that a specific instance exactly recovers the recurrence of the influential HiPPO model. Numerical simulations confirm our derivation, providing new theoretical tools for designing flexible and robust sequence models."}

The Generalized Resolution--Shell Dynamics (GRSD) framework models learning as spectral energy transport across logarithmic resolution shells, providing a coarse--grained dynamical description of training. Within GRSD, power--law scaling corresponds to a particularly simple renormalized shell dynamics; however, such behavior is not automatic and requires additional structural properties of the learning process.\n  In this work, we identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the GRSD shell dynamics admits a renormalizable coarse--grained description. These conditions constrain the learning configuration at multiple levels, including boundedness of gradient propagation in the computation graph, weak functional incoherence at initialization, controlled Jacobian evolution along training, and log--shift invariance of renormalized shell couplings. We further show that power--law scaling does not follow from renormalizability alone, but instead arises as a rigidity consequence: once log--shift invariance is combined with the intrinsic time--rescaling covariance of gradient flow, the renormalized GRSD velocity field is forced into a power--law form."}

Semi-supervised detection methods can utilize the supervision of partial labels, thus reducing false positive rates. However, most of the current semi-supervised methods focus on numerical data and neglect the heterogeneity of data information. In this paper, we propose a consistency-guided outlier detection algorithm (COD) for heterogeneous data with the fuzzy rough set theory in a semi-supervised manner. First, a few labeled outliers are leveraged to construct label-informed fuzzy similarity relations. Next, the consistency of the fuzzy decision system is introduced to evaluate attributes' contributions to knowledge classification. Subsequently, we define the outlier factor based on the fuzzy similarity class and predict outliers by integrating the classification consistency and the outlier factor. The proposed algorithm is extensively evaluated on 15 freshly proposed datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that COD is better than or comparable with the leading outlier detectors.

However, prevalent group-based algorithms such as GRPO require multi-rollout sampling for each prompt. While more efficient single-rollout variants have recently been explored in text-only settings, we find that they suffer from severe instability in multimodal contexts, often leading to training collapse. To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance. MSSR achieves this via an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes, preventing collapse and maintaining training stability. While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that MSSR enables stable, compute-efficient, and effective RLVR for complex multimodal reasoning tasks."}

The expectation values of observables measured on such a state exhibit time-dependent fluctuations which, through a fitting process, can be used to estimate the energy gap.

We attribute this effect to the weak alignment between policy performance and test loss, revealing substantial room for improvement through data selection. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective method, Stepwise Dual Ranking (SDR), which extracts a compact yet informative subset from large-scale offline behavioral datasets. SDR is build on two key principles: (1) stepwise clip, which prioritizes early-stage data; and (2) dual ranking, which selects samples with both high action-value rank and low state-density rank.

We argue that the reliance of GP on precise numerical fitting is fundamentally ill-suited in high-dimensional space, where it leads to prohibitive computational complexity. In order to address this, we propose a simple order-preserving Bayesian optimization (OPBO) method, where the surrogate model preserves the order, instead of the value, of the black-box objective function.

By representing each anatomically parcellated brain region as a visual token and encoding SNP profiles as structured text, the framework enables cross-modal attention that links regional atrophy patterns to underlying genetic factors.

Existing methods particularly those based on experience replay typically store and revisit past graph data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, these approaches pose significant limitations, including privacy concerns, inefficiency. In this work, we propose AL GNN, a novel framework for continual graph learning that eliminates the need for backpropagation and replay buffers. Instead, AL GNN leverages principles from analytic learning theory to formulate learning as a recursive least squares optimization process. It maintains and updates model knowledge analytically through closed form classifier updates and a regularized feature autocorrelation matrix. This design enables efficient one pass training for each task, and inherently preserves data privacy by avoiding historical sample storage. Extensive experiments on multiple dynamic graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that AL GNN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods. For instance, it improves average performance by 10% on CoraFull and reduces forgetting by over 30% on Reddit, while also reducing training time by nearly 50% due to its backpropagation free design."}

This tension has long obstructed the formulation of a relativistic master equation: standard Markovian approximations either break Lorentz covariance, trigger catastrophic vacuum heating, or depend arbitrarily on the observer's foliation. In this work, we derive a Lorentz-invariant description of irreversibility for quantum fields. We take an approach that explicitly models the measurements required to observe irreversible dynamics. Instead of evolving the system along an abstract geometric time parameter, we anchor the dynamics to a physical, relational scalar clock field. Using a relational Tomonaga-Schwinger framework, we derive a local, non-Markovian master equation that is manifestly covariant and completely positive. We show that the finite resolution of the physical clock acts as a covariant regulator, preventing the vacuum instability that plagues white-noise models. This framework demonstrates that a consistent relativistic theory of decay exists, provided the reference frame is treated as a dynamical quantum resource rather than a gauge choice. In a gravitating context, the resulting dynamics is described by a hybrid classical-quantum (CQ) evolution that remains completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP)."}

We analyze stability conditions for bounded internal embeddings under Lipschitz continuity and spectral constraints, discuss computational complexity, and examine theoretical properties including contraction behavior and fairness-performance tradeoffs.\n  This work positions ESAI as a conceptual contribution to differentiable alignment mechanisms in multi-agent systems. We identify open theoretical questions regarding convergence guarantees, embedding dimensionality, and extension to high-dimensional environments. Empirical evaluation is left to future work."}

These two groups of unitaries possess a combination of properties that make them ideal for benchmarking: (i) each is individually efficient to simulate classically, enabling verification at scale; (ii) together they form a universal gate set; (iii) they serve as essential algorithmic primitives in practical applications (including shadow tomography and quantum chemistry); and (iv) their definitions are formulated abstractly, without explicit reference to hardware-specific features such as qubit connectivity or native gate sets. This framework thus enables scalable and fair cross-platform comparisons and tracks meaningful computational advancement.

We study the training dynamics of neural networks under DP by comparing Gradient Descent (GD), and Adam to their privacy-preserving variants. Prior work shows that these optimizers exhibit distinct stability dynamics: full-batch methods train at the Edge of Stability (EoS), while mini-batch and adaptive methods exhibit analogous edge-of-stability behavior. At these regimes, the training loss and the sharpness--the maximum eigenvalue of the training loss Hessian--exhibit certain characteristic behavior. In DP training, per-example gradient clipping and Gaussian noise modify the update rule, and it is unclear whether these stability patterns persist. We analyze how clipping and noise change sharpness and loss evolution and show that while DP generally reduces the sharpness and can prevent optimizers from fully reaching the classical stability thresholds, patterns from EoS and analogous adaptive methods stability regimes persist, with the largest learning rates and largest privacy budgets approaching, and sometimes exceeding, these thresholds. These findings highlight the unpredictability introduced by DP in neural network optimization."}

Krylov subspace methods, such as Krylov Quantum Diagonalization and Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization, are promising approaches for this task on near-term quantum computers. However, both require repeated quantum circuit executions for each Krylov subspace and for every new Hamiltonian, posing a major bottleneck under noisy hardware constraints. We introduce Generative Krylov Subspace Representations (GenKSR), a framework that learns a classical generative representation of the entire Krylov diagonalization process. To enable effective modeling of quantum systems, GenKSR leverages a conditional generative model framework. We investigate two representative backbone architectures, the standard Transformer and the Mamba state-space model. By learning the distribution of measurement outcomes conditioned on Hamiltonian parameters and evolution time, GenKSR generates Krylov subspace samples for unseen Hamiltonians and for larger subspace dimensions than those used in training. This enables full energy reconstruction purely from the classical model, without additional quantum experiments. We validate our approach through simulations of 15-qubit 1D and 16-qubit 2D Heisenberg models, as well as a hardware experiment on a 20-qubit XXZ chain executed on an IBM quantum processor. Our model successfully learns the distribution from experimental data and generates a high-fidelity representation of the quantum process. This representation enables classical reproduction of experimental outcomes, supports reliable energy estimates for unseen Hamiltonians, and significantly reduces the need for further quantum computation."}

In the original framework, each ML-generated candidate model is embedded in a CFD solver and evaluated against reference data, requiring hundreds to thousands of high-fidelity simulations and resulting in prohibitive computational cost for complex flows. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extended framework that integrates surrogate modeling into symbolic CFD-driven training in real time to reduce training cost. The surrogate model learns to approximate the errors of ML-generated models based on previous CFD evaluations and is continuously refined during training. Newly generated models are first assessed using the surrogate, and only those predicted to yield small errors or high uncertainty are subsequently evaluated with full CFD simulations. Discrete expressions generated by symbolic regression are mapped into a continuous space using averaged input-symbol values as inputs to a probabilistic surrogate model. To support multi-objective model training, particularly when fixed weighting of competing quantities is challenging, the surrogate is extended to a multi-output formulation by generalizing the kernel to a matrix form, providing one mean and variance prediction per training objective. Selection metrics based on these probabilistic outputs are used to identify an optimal training setup. The proposed surrogate-augmented CFD-driven training framework is demonstrated across a range of statistically one- and two-dimensional flows, including both single- and multi-expression model optimization. In all cases, the framework substantially reduces training cost while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to that of the original CFD-driven approach."}

We demonstrate that, in several parameter regimes, the transfer fidelity in the non-Hermitian setting exceeds the classical threshold and can even exceed the performance of the corresponding Hermitian models. In particular, for the SSH model with dominant inter-cell coupling, the broken phase supports near-unit-fidelity quantum state transfer, a level of performance that the corresponding Hermitian model fails to attain. Moreover, we establish a correspondence between the non-Hermitian and Hermitian descriptions by identifying related parameter regions in which the fidelity fails to surpass the classical bound."}

To maintain a comfortable indoor environment and minimize the contribution of the building to climate change as much as possible, higher requirements are placed on the operation and control of HVAC systems, e.g., more energy-efficient and flexible to response to the rapid change of weather. This places demands on the rapid modeling and prediction of zone air temperatures of buildings. Compared to the traditional simulation-based approach such as EnergyPlus and DOE2, a hybrid approach combined physics and data-driven is more suitable. Recently, the availability of high-quality datasets and algorithmic breakthroughs have driven a considerable amount of work in this field. However, in the niche of short- and long-term predictions, there are still some gaps in existing research. This paper aims to develop a time series forecast model to predict the zone air temperature in a building located in America on a 2-week horizon. The findings could be further improved to support intelligent control and operation of HVAC systems (i.e. demand flexibility) and could also be used as hybrid building energy modeling."}

By making use of the underlying dihedral symmetry of this system -- which allows one to use a symmetry-adapted computational basis with $\\mathcal{O}(2^N / N)$ states in an $N$-qubit system -- and utilizing advanced global-optimization methods, we find optimal sequences of pulses for realizing $W$ and Dicke states within both approaches.

Recent increases in drought severity, frequency, and duration underscore the need for effective monitoring and mitigation strategies. Predicting drought impacts rather than drought conditions alone offers opportunities to support early warning systems and proactive decision-making. This study applies machine learning techniques to link drought indices with historical drought impact records (2005:2024) to generate short-term impact forecasts. By addressing key conceptual and data-driven challenges regarding temporal scale and impact quantification, the study aims to improve the predictability of drought impacts at actionable lead times. The Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) were combined with impact data from the Drought Impact Reporter (DIR) to model and forecast weekly drought impacts. Results indicate that Fire and Relief impacts were predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by Agriculture and Water, while forecasts for Plants and Society impacts showed greater variability. County and state level forecasts for New Mexico were produced using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that incorporated both DSCI and ESI. The model successfully generated forecasts up to eight weeks in advance using the preceding eight weeks of data for most impact categories. This work supports the development of an Ecological Drought Information Communication System (EcoDri) for New Mexico and demonstrates the potential for broader application in similar drought-prone regions.

Our method distinguishes between \\emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \\emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters.

In this work, we treat interactions as the fundamental units of such structure and investigate a largely unexplored question: how DNNs encode interactions under different levels of contextual complexity, and how these microscopic interaction patterns shape macroscopic representation capacity. To quantify this complexity, we use multi-order interactions [57], where each order reflects the amount of contextual information required to evaluate the joint interaction utility of a variable pair. This formulation enables a stratified analysis of cooperative patterns learned by DNNs. Building on this formulation, we develop a comprehensive study of interaction structure in DNNs. (i) We empirically discover a universal interaction bottleneck: across architectures and tasks, DNNs easily learn low-order and high-order interactions but consistently under-represent mid-order ones. (ii) We theoretically explain this bottleneck by proving that mid-order interactions incur the highest contextual variability, yielding large gradient variance and making them intrinsically difficult to learn. (iii) We further modulate the bottleneck by introducing losses that steer models toward emphasizing interactions of selected orders. Finally, we connect microscopic interaction structures with macroscopic representational behavior: low-order-emphasized models exhibit stronger generalization and robustness, whereas high-order-emphasized models demonstrate greater structural modeling and fitting capability. Together, these results uncover an inherent representational bias in modern DNNs and establish interaction order as a powerful lens for interpreting and guiding deep representations."}

This disentanglement is achieved by enforcing analogical consistency in the embedding space to ensure the semantic transformation of adding an attribute (e.g., a length constraint) remains invariant across different problem contexts.

To do this, we use Matrix Product Operators to model the system, a technique recently used to model boson sampling scenarios. Our investigation finds that the Entanglement entropy grows linearly with the number of input states even for noisy input states.

Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity. The analysis demonstrates that since FAIR-k promotes fresh (and fair) parameter updates, it not only accelerates convergence but also enhances communication efficiency by enabling an extended period of local training without significantly affecting overall training efficiency."}

We show that the interference between these two coupling channels induces strong non-Markovian feedback between populations and coherences, leading to coherence trapping and enhanced thermal sensitivity. Remarkably, by tuning the coupling structure, the probe's temperature sensitivity exhibits a quadratic low-temperature scaling, even under weak coupling. Moreover, while coherence-based measurements are formally suboptimal, they become the most informative in the early nonequilibrium regime, where memory effects dominate. Our findings identify noncommutative system-bath couplings as a practical and tunable resource for achieving high-precision quantum thermometry in realistic open-system architectures."}

A fundamental challenge in observational data is that while we need to infer outcome differences under alternative treatments, we can only observe each individual's outcome under a single treatment. Existing approaches address this limitation either by training with inferred pseudo-outcomes or by creating matched instance pairs. However, recent work has largely overlooked the potential impact of post-treatment variables on the outcome. This oversight prevents existing methods from fully capturing outcome variability, resulting in increased variance in counterfactual predictions. This paper introduces Pseudo-outcome Imputation with Post-treatment Variables for Counterfactual Regression (PIPCFR), a novel approach that incorporates post-treatment variables to improve pseudo-outcome imputation. We analyze the challenges inherent in utilizing post-treatment variables and establish a novel theoretical bound for ITE risk that explicitly connects post-treatment variables to ITE estimation accuracy. Unlike existing methods that ignore these variables or impose restrictive assumptions, PIPCFR learns effective representations that preserve informative components while mitigating bias. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate that PIPCFR achieves significantly lower ITE errors compared to existing methods."}

Methods: Our CA architecture first processes the iEEG signal using state-of-the-art models applied to each single channel independently. The resulting features are then fused using a vector-symbolic algorithm which reconstructs the spatial relationship using a trainable scalar per channel. Finally, the fused features are accumulated in a long-term memory of up to 2 minutes to perform the classification. Each CA-model can then be pre-trained on a large corpus of iEEG recordings from multiple heterogeneous subjects. The pre-trained model is personalized to each subject via a quick fine-tuning routine, which uses equal or lower amounts of data compared to existing state-of-the-art models, but requiring only 1/5 of the time. Results: We evaluate our CA-models on a seizure detection task both on a short-term (~20 hours) and a long-term (~2500 hours) dataset. In particular, our CA-EEGWaveNet is trained on a single seizure of the tested subject, while the baseline EEGWaveNet is trained on all but one. Even in this challenging scenario, our CA-EEGWaveNet surpasses the baseline in median F1-score (0.78 vs 0.76). Similarly, CA-EEGNet based on EEGNet, also surpasses its baseline in median F1-score (0.79 vs 0.74). Conclusion and significance: Our CA-model addresses two issues: first, it is channel-adaptive and can therefore be trained across heterogeneous subjects without loss of performance; second, it increases the effective temporal context size to a clinically-relevant length. Therefore, our model is a drop-in replacement for existing models, bringing better characteristics and performance across the board."}

However, it typically incurs a measurement overhead exponential in the number of cut locations, and it remains open whether this scaling is fundamentally unavoidable. In conventional circuit-cutting approaches based on the quasiprobability decomposition (QPD), for example, rescaling factors lead to an exponential dependence on the number of cuts. In this work, we show that such an exponential scaling is not universal: it can be circumvented for tree-structured quantum circuits via concatenated quantum tomography protocols. We first consider estimating the expectation value of an observable within additive error $ε$ for a tree-structured circuit with tree depth 1 (two layers), maximum branching factor $R$, and bond dimension at most $d$ on each edge. Our approach uses quantum tomography to construct, for each cut edge, a local decomposition that eliminates the rescaling factors in conventional QPD, instead introducing a controllable bias set by the tomography sample size. After cutting $R$ edges, we show that $\\mathcal{O}(d^3R^3\\ln(dR)/ε^2)$ total measurements suffice, including tomography cost. Next, we extend the tree-depth-1 case to general trees of depth $L\\geq2$, and give an algorithm whose total measurement cost $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^3K^{5}/ε^2)$ scales polynomially with the number of cuts for complete $R$-ary trees. Finally, we perform an information-theoretic analysis to show that, in a comparable tree-depth-1 setting, conventional QPD-based wire-cutting methods require at least $Ω((d+1)^R/ε^2)$ measurements.

Nevertheless, the existing industrial hybrid modeling methods still face two main limitations. First, current research has mainly focused on applying a single machine learning method to one specific task, failing to develop a comprehensive machine learning architecture suitable for modeling tasks, which limits their ability to effectively represent complex industrial scenarios. Second, industrial datasets often contain underlying associations (e.g., monotonicity or periodicity) that are not adequately exploited by current research, which can degrade model's predictive performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Recurrent Perceptron-based Channel Attention Transformer Encoder (RP-CATE), with three distinctive characteristics: 1: We developed a novel architecture by replacing the self-attention mechanism with channel attention and incorporating our proposed Recurrent Perceptron (RP) Module into Transformer, achieving enhanced effectiveness for industrial modeling tasks compared to the original Transformer. 2: We proposed a new data type called Pseudo-Image Data (PID) tailored for channel attention requirements and developed a cyclic sliding window method for generating PID. 3: We introduced the concept of Pseudo-Sequential Data (PSD) and a method for converting industrial datasets into PSD, which enables the RP Module to capture the underlying associations within industrial dataset more effectively.

Critically, even minimal replay buffers (0.1%) dramatically improve retention - increasing NLU retention after Math training from 45% to 65% across all precision levels - with INT8 consistently achieving the optimal balance between learning plasticity and knowledge retention. We hypothesize that quantization-induced noise acts as implicit regularization, preventing the overfitting to new task gradients that plagues high-precision models. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that higher precision is always preferable, suggesting instead that INT8 quantization offers both computational efficiency and superior continual learning dynamics. Our results provide practical guidelines for deploying compressed models in continual learning scenarios: small replay buffers (1-2%) suffice for NLU tasks, while Math and Code benefit from moderate buffers (5-10%), with quantized models requiring less replay than FP16 to achieve comparable retention.

In particular, recent works have generalized this concept to microscopy setups, but the sensitivity to optical path differences constrains its application to samples with thickness variation typically below a few micrometers if tracking changes in the coincidences at a fixed delay. Extending the concept to polarization microscopy and circumventing this limitation, this manuscript explores the use of a narrowband photon pair source with coherence length >1 mm to broaden the HOM dip. Thus, realistic sample-thickness variations introduce negligible temporal distinguishability, and changes in coincidence rate at the dip centre are then dominated by sample-induced polarization effects. To compute the polarization rotation, we develop a statistical model for the interferometer, derive the Fisher information, and establish a maximum-likelihood estimator for the local fast-axis angle. Recording dip and baseline frames at each sample position via raster scanning, the experimental results validate the framework, agreeing with classical polarized-intensity images while demonstrating operation at a maximum-precision regime and insensitiveness to layer thickness. Overall, the approach enclosed provides a quantum-based quantitative imaging of birefringent structures, which can motivate further advantageous applications, including enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and lower damage imaging of photosensitive samples."}

A key challenge experienced in these more realistic domains is highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to the agent's observations, which are less common in small controlled domains. The predominant approach for dealing with this in the literature is to stack together a window of the most recent observations (Frame Stacking), but this window size must grow with the degree of non-Markovian dependencies, which results in prohibitive computational and memory requirements for both action inference and learning. In this paper, we are motivated by the insight that in many environments that are highly non-Markovian with respect to time, the environment only causally depends on a relatively small number of observations over that time-scale. A natural direction would then be to consider meta-algorithms that maintain relatively small adaptive stacks of memories such that it is possible to express highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to time while considering fewer observations at each step and thus experience substantial savings in both compute and memory requirements. Hence, we propose a meta-algorithm (Adaptive Stacking) for achieving exactly that with convergence guarantees and quantify the reduced computation and memory constraints for MLP, LSTM, and Transformer-based agents. Our experiments utilize popular memory tasks, which give us control over the degree of non-Markovian dependencies. This allows us to demonstrate that an appropriate meta-algorithm can learn the removal of memories not predictive of future rewards without excessive removal of important experiences.

We introduce four core benchmarks addressing complementary aspects of quantum computing capability: large multi-qubit circuit execution via a Clifford Volume benchmark, scalable multipartite entanglement generation through GHZ-state preparation, a benchmark based on the application of Shor's period-finding subroutine to simple functions, and a protocol quantifying the benefit of quantum error correction using Bell states.

We present a multimodal formulation of hybrid learning and propose a cross attention mid fusion architecture in which a classical representation queries quantum derived feature tokens through an attention block with residual connectivity. The quantum branch is kept within practical NISQ budgets and uses up to nine qubits. We evaluate on Wine, Breast Cancer, Forest CoverType, FashionMNIST, and SteelPlatesFaults, comparing a quantum only model, a classical baseline, residual hybrid models, and the proposed mid fusion model under a consistent protocol. Pure quantum and standard hybrid designs underperform due to measurement induced information loss, while cross attention mid fusion is consistently competitive and improves performance on the more complex datasets in most cases. These findings suggest that quantum derived information becomes most valuable when integrated through principled multimodal fusion rather than used in isolation or loosely appended to classical features."}

We introduce R-GenIMA, an interpretable multimodal large language model that couples a novel ROI-wise vision transformer with genetic prompting to jointly model structural MRI and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) variations. By representing each anatomically parcellated brain region as a visual token and encoding SNP profiles as structured text, the framework enables cross-modal attention that links regional atrophy patterns to underlying genetic factors. Applied to the ADNI cohort, R-GenIMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in four-way classification across normal cognition (NC), subjective memory concerns (SMC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Beyond predictive accuracy, the model yields biologically meaningful explanations by identifying stage-specific brain regions and gene signatures, as well as coherent ROI-Gene association patterns across the disease continuum. Attention-based attribution revealed genes consistently enriched for established GWAS-supported AD risk loci, including APOE, BIN1, CLU, and RBFOX1. Stage-resolved neuroanatomical signatures identified shared vulnerability hubs across disease stages alongside stage-specific patterns: striatal involvement in subjective decline, frontotemporal engagement during prodromal impairment, and consolidated multimodal network disruption in AD. These results demonstrate that interpretable multimodal AI can synthesize imaging and genetics to reveal mechanistic insights, providing a foundation for clinically deployable tools that enable earlier risk stratification and inform precision therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer's disease."}

Their non-stabilizerness provides the additional resource required to overcome the constraints of stabilizer codes, as formalized by the Eastin-Knill theorem, while still permitting fault-tolerant distillation. Although numerous measures of magic have been introduced, not every state with nonzero magic has been shown to be distillable by a stabilizer code, and all currently known distillable states arise as special cases of Clifford-stabilizer states, defined as pure states uniquely stabilized by finite subgroups of the Clifford group. In this work, we develop a general framework for group-covariant functionals on the real manifold of Hermitian operators. We formalize the notions of $G$-stabilizer spaces, states, and codes for arbitrary finite subgroups $G \\subset \\mathrm{U}(\\mathcal{H})$, and introduce analytic families of $G$-covariant functionals. Our main theorem shows that any $G$-invariant pure state is an extremal point of a broad class of derived functionals, including symmetric, max-type, and Rényi-type functionals, provided the underlying family is $G$-covariant. This extremality holds for variations restricted to directions orthogonal to the stabilized subspace while preserving purity. Specializing to the Pauli and Clifford groups, our framework unifies the extremality structure of several canonical magic measures, including mana, stabilizer Rényi entropies, and stabilizer fidelity. In particular, Clifford-stabilizer states extremize these measures. We classify such states for qubits, qutrits, ququints, and two-qubit systems, identifying new candidates for magic distillation protocols. We further propose an inefficient distillation protocol for a two-qubit magic state with stabilizer fidelity exceeding that of standard benchmark states."}

Our method distinguishes between \\emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \\emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters.

We propose the use of two distinct quantum annealer sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals, and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau. Remarkably, we find that fast quench-like anneals can quickly generate ensemble distributions that are very good estimates of the true partition function of the classical Ising model; on a Pegasus graph-structured QPU we report a logarithmic relative error of $7.6 \\times 10^{-6}$, from $171,000$ samples generated using $0.2$ seconds of QPU time with an anneal time of $8$ nanoseconds per sample which is interestingly within the closed system dynamics timescale of the superconducting qubits."}

Fixed-precision quantization struggles to handle outlier channels in the key cache, while current mixed-precision strategies fail to accurately identify components requiring high-precision representation. We find that an effective low-bit KV cache quantization strategy must consider two factors: a key channel's intrinsic quantization difficulty and its relevance to the query. Based on this insight, we propose MixKVQ, a novel plug-and-play method that introduces a lightweight, query-aware algorithm to identify and preserve critical key channels that need higher precision, while applying per-token quantization for value cache.

This raises a basic question: is there a general, modality-agnostic way to quantify how acquisition itself preserves or destroys the information that downstream learners could use? Here we propose an acquisition-level scalar $ΔS_{\\mathcal B}$ based on instrument-resolved phase space. Unlike pixelwise distortion or purely spectral errors that often saturate under aggressive undersampling, $ΔS_{\\mathcal B}$ directly quantifies how acquisition mixes or removes joint space--frequency structure at the instrument scale. We show theoretically that \\(ΔS_{\\mathcal B}\\) correctly identifies the phase-space coherence of periodic sampling as the physical source of aliasing, recovering classical sampling-theorem consequences. Empirically, across masked image classification, accelerated MRI, and massive MIMO (including over-the-air measurements), $|ΔS_{\\mathcal B}|$ consistently ranks sampling geometries and predicts downstream reconstruction/recognition difficulty \\emph{without training}. In particular, minimizing $|ΔS_{\\mathcal B}|$ enables zero-training selection of variable-density MRI mask parameters that matches designs tuned by conventional pre-reconstruction criteria. These results suggest that phase-space entropy at acquisition reflects downstream learnability, enabling pre-training selection of candidate sampling policies and as a shared notion of information preservation across modalities."}

A key challenge experienced in these more realistic domains is highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to the agent's observations, which are less common in small controlled domains. The predominant approach for dealing with this in the literature is to stack together a window of the most recent observations (Frame Stacking), but this window size must grow with the degree of non-Markovian dependencies, which results in prohibitive computational and memory requirements for both action inference and learning. In this paper, we are motivated by the insight that in many environments that are highly non-Markovian with respect to time, the environment only causally depends on a relatively small number of observations over that time-scale. A natural direction would then be to consider meta-algorithms that maintain relatively small adaptive stacks of memories such that it is possible to express highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to time while considering fewer observations at each step and thus experience substantial savings in both compute and memory requirements. Hence, we propose a meta-algorithm (Adaptive Stacking) for achieving exactly that with convergence guarantees and quantify the reduced computation and memory constraints for MLP, LSTM, and Transformer-based agents. Our experiments utilize popular memory tasks, which give us control over the degree of non-Markovian dependencies. This allows us to demonstrate that an appropriate meta-algorithm can learn the removal of memories not predictive of future rewards without excessive removal of important experiences.

However, in complex industrial scenarios, the issue of insufficient data volume persists, which diminishes the reliability of soft sensing. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are one of the effective solutions for addressing insufficient samples. Nevertheless, traditional GAN fail to account for the mapping relationship between labels and features, which limits further performance improvement. Although some studies have proposed solutions, none have considered both performance and efficiency simultaneously. To address these problems, this paper proposes the multi-task learning-based regression GAN framework that integrates regression information into both the discriminator and generator, and implements a shallow sharing mechanism between the discriminator and regressor. This approach significantly enhances the quality of generated samples while improving the algorithm's operational efficiency. Moreover, considering the importance of training samples and generated samples, a dual data evaluation strategy is designed to make GAN generate more diverse samples, thereby increasing the generalization of subsequent modeling. The superiority of method is validated through four classic industrial soft sensing cases: wastewater treatment plants, surface water, $CO_2$ absorption towers, and industrial gas turbines."}

This neglects that the quantum and classical branches constitute distinct computational modalities and limits reliable performance on complex, high dimensional tabular and semi structured data, including remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnostics. We present a multimodal formulation of hybrid learning and propose a cross attention mid fusion architecture in which a classical representation queries quantum derived feature tokens through an attention block with residual connectivity. The quantum branch is kept within practical NISQ budgets and uses up to nine qubits. We evaluate on Wine, Breast Cancer, Forest CoverType, FashionMNIST, and SteelPlatesFaults, comparing a quantum only model, a classical baseline, residual hybrid models, and the proposed mid fusion model under a consistent protocol. Pure quantum and standard hybrid designs underperform due to measurement induced information loss, while cross attention mid fusion is consistently competitive and improves performance on the more complex datasets in most cases. These findings suggest that quantum derived information becomes most valuable when integrated through principled multimodal fusion rather than used in isolation or loosely appended to classical features."}

Reducing $|J_2|/J_1$ causes increasingly strong spin-wave renormalization, flattening these modes then merging them into a continuum characteristic of deconfined spinons at all finite energies in the QSL. The low-energy continuum and the occurrence of gap closure at multiple high-symmetry points identify this gapless QSL as the U(1) Dirac spin liquid. These results establish a unified understanding of spin excitations in highly frustrated quantum magnets and provide clear spectral fingerprints for experimental detection in candidate kagome QSL materials."}

MetaSHAP operates over a vast benchmark of over 09 millions evaluated machine learning pipelines, allowing it to produce interpretable importance scores and actionable tuning insights that reveal how much each hyperparameter matters, how it interacts with others and in which value ranges its influence is concentrated.

This allows practitioners not only to prioritize which hyperparameters to tune, but also to understand their directionality and interactions. We empirically validate MetaSHAP on a diverse benchmark of 164 classification datasets and 14 classifiers, demonstrating that it produces reliable importance rankings and competitive performance when used to guide Bayesian optimization."}

In conventional thermodynamic trade-off relations, the quantities of interest are linear in the underlying probability distribution. Some important information-theoretic quantities, such as Rényi entropies, are nonlinear; however, such nonlinearities are generally more difficult to handle. Inspired by replica techniques used in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we construct Markovian dynamics of identical replicas and derive a lower bound on relative moments in terms of the dynamical activity. We apply our general result to two scenarios. First, for a random walker on a network, we derive an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the position distribution of the walker, which quantifies the extent of diffusion on the network. Remarkably, the bound is expressed solely in terms of escape rate from the initial node, and thus depends only on local information. Second, we consider trajectory observables in Markov processes and obtain an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the distribution of these observables, again in terms of the dynamical activity. This provides an entropic characterization of uncertainty that generalizes existing variance-based thermodynamic uncertainty relations."}

Fixed-precision quantization struggles to handle outlier channels in the key cache, while current mixed-precision strategies fail to accurately identify components requiring high-precision representation. We find that an effective low-bit KV cache quantization strategy must consider two factors: a key channel's intrinsic quantization difficulty and its relevance to the query.

This hinges on subtle interactions between linear aggregation and eventually constant non-linearities, and it establishes that GNNs using ReLU are more expressive than those restricted to eventually constant activations and linear layers."}

Existing methods often lack adaptability to dynamic conditions and fail to optimize decision making in real time. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid reinforcement learning framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for enhanced spoilage prediction. This hybrid architecture captures temporal dependencies within sensor data, enabling robust and adaptive decision making. In alignment with interpretable artificial intelligence principles, a rule-based classifier environment is employed to provide transparent ground truth labeling of spoilage levels based on domain-specific thresholds. This structured design allows the agent to operate within clearly defined semantic boundaries, supporting traceable and interpretable decisions. Model behavior is monitored using interpretability-driven metrics, including spoilage accuracy, reward-to-step ratio, loss reduction rate, and exploration decay. These metrics provide both quantitative performance evaluation and insights into learning dynamics. A class-wise spoilage distribution visualization is used to analyze the agents decision profile and policy behavior. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-time hardware data demonstrate that the LSTM and RNN based agent outperforms alternative reinforcement learning approaches in prediction accuracy and decision efficiency while maintaining interpretability. The results highlight the potential of hybrid deep reinforcement learning with integrated interpretability for scalable IoT-based food monitoring systems."}

We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period.

We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only.

To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior."}

In physics, conservation laws of Hamiltonian systems such as symplecticity guarantee long-term stability, and recent work has begun to hard-wire such constraints into learning models at the loss or output level. Here we ask a different question: what would it mean for the representation itself to obey a symplectic conservation law in the sense of Hamiltonian mechanics?\n  We express this symplectic constraint through Legendre duality: the pairing between primal and dual parameters, which becomes the structure that the representation must preserve. We formalize Legendre dynamics as stochastic processes whose trajectories remain on Legendre graphs, so that the evolving primal-dual parameters stay Legendre dual. We show that this class includes linear time-invariant Gaussian process regression and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics.\n  Geometrically, we prove that the maps that preserve all Legendre graphs are exactly symplectomorphisms of cotangent bundles of the form \"cotangent lift of a base diffeomorphism followed by an exact fibre translation\". Dynamically, this characterization leads to the design of a Symplectic Reservoir (SR), a reservoir-computing architecture that is a special case of recurrent neural network and whose recurrent core is generated by Hamiltonian systems that are at most linear in the momentum.\n  Our main theorem shows that every SR update has this normal form and therefore transports Legendre graphs to Legendre graphs, preserving Legendre duality at each time step. Overall, SR implements a geometrically constrained, Legendre-preserving representation map, injecting symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics directly at the representational level."}

While neural operator methods such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and Koopman-inspired extensions achieve good short-term accuracy, their long-term stability is often limited by unconstrained latent representations and cumulative rollout errors. In this work, we introduce an inverse scattering inspired Fourier Neural Operator(IS-FNO), motivated by the reversibility and spectral evolution structure underlying the classical inverse scattering transform. The proposed architecture enforces a near-reversible pairing between lifting and projection maps through an explicitly invertible neural transformation, and models latent temporal evolution using exponential Fourier layers that naturally encode linear and nonlinear spectral dynamics. We systematically evaluate IS-FNO against baseline FNO and Koopman-based models on a range of benchmark PDEs, including the Michelson-Sivashinsky and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations (in one and two dimensions), as well as the integrable Korteweg-de Vries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. The results demonstrate that IS-FNO achieves lower short-term errors and substantially improved long-horizon stability in non-stiff regimes. For integrable systems, reduced IS-FNO variants that embed analytical scattering structure retain competitive long-term accuracy despite limited model capacity. Overall, this work shows that incorporating physical structure -- particularly reversibility and spectral evolution -- into neural operator design significantly enhances robustness and long-term predictive fidelity for nonlinear PDE dynamics."}

Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training. By aligning training objective at lower layer, BuPO reconstructs foundational reasoning capabilities and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/BuPO."}

Unlike other kernel methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), KLRs are generally not sparse. Previous attempts to deal with sparsity in KLR include a heuristic method referred to as the Import Vector Machine (IVM) and ad hoc regularizations such as the $\\ell_{1/2}$-based one. Achieving a good trade-off between prediction accuracy and sparsity is still a challenging issue with a potential significant impact from the application point of view. In this work, we revisit binary KLR and propose an extension of the training formulation proposed by Keerthi et al., which is able to induce sparsity in the trained model, while maintaining good testing accuracy. To efficiently solve the dual of this formulation, we devise a decomposition algorithm of Sequential Minimal Optimization type which exploits second-order information, and for which we establish global convergence. Numerical experiments conducted on 12 datasets from the literature show that the proposed binary KLR approach achieves a competitive trade-off between accuracy and sparsity with respect to IVM, $\\ell_{1/2}$-based regularization for KLR, and SVM while retaining the advantages of providing informative estimates of the class membership probabilities."}

On the other hand, post-hoc methods, which evaluate pre-trained models, focus on solving problems related to improving the confidence in the model's predictions, and detecting Out-Of-Distribution or Adversarial Attacks samples as independent applications. To tackle the limited applicability of already existing methods, we introduce Multi-Layer Analysis for Confidence Scoring (MACS), a unified post-hoc framework that analyzes intermediate activations to produce classification-maps.

A high-capacity teacher model identifies the most relevant features through SHAP explanations, and a compressed student leverages Kronecker-structured layers to minimize parameters while preserving discriminative inputs. Knowledge distillation transfers softened decision boundaries from teacher to student, improving generalization under compression. Experiments on the TON\\_IoT dataset show that the student is nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the teacher yet sustains macro-F1 above 0.986 with millisecond-level inference latency.

Most research to-date builds on domain-knowledge-based corruption risk indicators of individual contract-level features and some also analyzes contracting network patterns. A critical barrier for supervised machine learning is the absence of confirmed non-corrupt, negative, examples, which makes conventional machine learning inappropriate for this task. Using publicly available data on federally funded procurement in Mexico and company sanction records, this study implements positive-unlabeled (PU) learning algorithms that integrate domain-knowledge-based red flags with network-derived features to identify likely corrupt and fraudulent contracts. The best-performing PU model on average captures 32 percent more known positives and performs on average 2.3 times better than random guessing, substantially outperforming approaches based solely on traditional red flags. The analysis of the Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that network-derived features, particularly those associated with contracts in the network core or suppliers with high eigenvector centrality, are the most important. Traditional red flags further enhance model performance in line with expectations, albeit mainly for contracts awarded through competitive tenders. This methodology can support law enforcement in Mexico, and it can be adapted to other national contexts too."}

To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior."}

Existing CI tests often rely on restrictive structural conditions, limiting their validity on real-world data. Kernel methods using the partial covariance operator offer a more principled approach but suffer from limited adaptivity, slow convergence, and poor scalability. In this work, we explore whether representation learning can help address these limitations. Specifically, we focus on representations derived from the singular value decomposition of the partial covariance operator and use them to construct a simple test statistic, reminiscent of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). We also introduce a practical bi-level contrastive algorithm to learn these representations. Our theory links representation learning error to test performance and establishes asymptotic validity and power guarantees. Preliminary experiments suggest that this approach offers a practical and statistically grounded path toward scalable CI testing, bridging kernel-based theory with modern representation learning."}

However, learning-based scheduling on unrelated parallel machines remains particularly difficult to design. Not only do the numbers of jobs and machines vary, but each job-machine pair has a unique processing time, dynamically altering feature dimensions. We propose a novel approach with a neural network tailored for offline deterministic scheduling of arbitrary sizes on unrelated machines. The goal is to minimize a complex objective function that includes the makespan and the weighted tardiness of jobs and machines. Unlike existing online approaches, which process jobs sequentially, our method generates a complete schedule considering the entire input at once. The key contribution of this work lies in the sophisticated architecture of our model. By leveraging various NLP-inspired architectures, it effectively processes any number of jobs and machines with varying feature dimensions imposed by unrelated processing times. Our approach enables supervised training on small problem instances while demonstrating strong generalization to much larger scheduling environments. Trained and tested on instances with 8 jobs and 4 machines, costs were only 2.51% above optimal. Across all tested configurations of up to 100 jobs and 10 machines, our network consistently outperformed an advanced dispatching rule, which incurred 22.22% higher costs on average. As our method allows fast retraining with simulated data and adaptation to various scheduling conditions, we believe it has the potential to become a standard approach for learning-based scheduling on unrelated machines and similar problem environments."}

In practice, error accumulation can become unacceptable beyond the training horizon, and existing methods lack mechanisms for online monitoring or correction. To address this gap, we propose ANCHOR (Adaptive Numerical Correction for High-fidelity Operator Rollouts), an online, instance-aware hybrid inference framework for stable long-horizon prediction of nonlinear, time-dependent PDEs. ANCHOR treats a pretrained NO as the primary inference engine and adaptively couples it with a classical numerical solver using a physics-informed, residual-based error estimator. Inspired by adaptive time-stepping in numerical analysis, ANCHOR monitors an exponential moving average (EMA) of the normalized PDE residual to detect accumulating error and trigger corrective solver interventions without requiring access to ground-truth solutions. We show that the EMA-based estimator correlates strongly with the true relative L2 error, enabling data-free, instance-aware error control during inference. Evaluations on four canonical PDEs: 1D and 2D Burgers', 2D Allen-Cahn, and 3D heat conduction, demonstrate that ANCHOR reliably bounds long-horizon error growth, stabilizes extrapolative rollouts, and significantly improves robustness over standalone neural operators, while remaining substantially more efficient than high-fidelity numerical solvers."}

(b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training. By aligning training objective at lower layer, BuPO reconstructs foundational reasoning capabilities and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/BuPO."}

Existing approaches typically employ architecture-specific heuristics, which become impractical as system complexity grows.

Specifically, we fine-tune pretrained LLMs to generate the required shuttling operations. We evaluate this approach on both linear and branched one-dimensional architectures, demonstrating that it provides a foundation for developing LLM-based shuttling compilers for trapped-ion quantum computers."}

While algorithms such as Network Dissection and CLIP-Dissect achieve great empirical success, a rigorous theoretical foundation remains absent, which is crucial to enable trustworthy and reliable explanations. In this work, we observe that neuron identification can be viewed as the inverse process of machine learning, which allows us to derive guarantees for neuron explanations. Based on this insight, we present the first theoretical analysis of two fundamental challenges: (1) Faithfulness: whether the identified concept faithfully represents the neuron's underlying function and (2) Stability: whether the identification results are consistent across probing datasets. We derive generalization bounds for widely used similarity metrics (e.g. accuracy, AUROC, IoU) to guarantee faithfulness, and propose a bootstrap ensemble procedure that quantifies stability along with BE (Bootstrap Explanation) method to generate concept prediction sets with guaranteed coverage probability. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the practicality of our method, providing an important step toward trustworthy neuron identification."}

Here, we introduce a computational framework based on normalizing flows that directly maps solvent configurations between solutes of different sizes, and compare the accuracy and efficiency to conventional free energy estimates. For a Lennard-Jones solvent, we demonstrate that this approach yields acceptable accuracy in estimating free energy differences for challenging transformations, such as solute growth or increased solute-solute separation, which typically demand multiple intermediate simulation steps along the transformation. Analysis of radial distribution functions indicates that the flow generates physically meaningful solvent rearrangements, substantially enhancing configurational overlap between states in configuration space. These results suggest flow-based models as a promising alternative to traditional free energy estimation methods."}

The method effectively addresses the cognitive deadlock problem in multi-step reasoning for small models. Experiments on models <=7B parameters show: map-guided methods achieve 81.20% accuracy on 500 challenging problems (relative baseline +16.80%), reduce reasoning time by >= 15x, with key findings revealing that reasoning stagnation manifests as \"Cognitive Vortex\" and low-entropy potential wells, while temperature perturbations effectively restart energy flow.

Most models of learning and inference, however, presuppose a fixed representational basis within which belief updating occurs. In this paper, I address a prior question: under what structural conditions can the representational basis itself expand in a principled and selective way?\n  I propose a geometric framework in which conceptual growth is modeled as admissible basis extension evaluated under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Experience, whether externally observed or internally simulated, is represented as vectors relative to a current conceptual subspace. Residual components capture systematic representational failure, and candidate conceptual extensions are restricted to low-rank, admissible transformations. I show that any MDL-accepted extension can be chosen so that its novel directions lie entirely within the residual span induced by experience, while extensions orthogonal to this span strictly increase description length and are therefore rejected.\n  This yields a conservative account of imagination and conceptual innovation. Internally generated counterfactual representations contribute to learning only insofar as they expose or amplify structured residual error, and cannot introduce arbitrary novelty. I further distinguish representational counterfactuals--counterfactuals over an agent's conceptual basis--from causal or value-level counterfactuals, and show how MDL provides a normative selection principle governing representational change.\n  Overall, the framework characterizes conceptual development as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process of basis extension, clarifying both the role and the limits of imagination in learning and theory change."}

Popular Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines reinforce final answers but provide little fine-grained conceptual signal, so models improve at pattern reuse rather than conceptual applications. We introduce CORE (Concept-Oriented REinforcement), an RL training framework that turns explicit concepts into a controllable supervision signal. Starting from a high-quality, low-contamination textbook resource that links verifiable exercises to concise concept descriptions, we run a sanity probe showing LLMs can restate definitions but fail concept-linked quizzes, quantifying the conceptual reasoning gap. CORE then (i) synthesizes concept-aligned quizzes, (ii) injects brief concept snippets during rollouts to elicit concept-primed trajectories, and (iii) reinforces conceptual reasoning via trajectory replacement after group failures, a lightweight forward-KL constraint that aligns unguided with concept-primed policies, or standard GRPO directly on concept-aligned quizzes. Across several models, CORE delivers consistent gains over vanilla and SFT baselines on both in-domain concept-exercise suites and diverse out-of-domain math benchmarks. CORE unifies direct training on concept-aligned quizzes and concept-injected rollouts under outcome regularization. It provides fine-grained conceptual supervision that bridges problem-solving competence and genuine conceptual reasoning, while remaining algorithm- and verifier-agnostic."}

Extending these successes to multimodal reasoning remains challenging due to the increased complexity of integrating diverse input modalities and the scarcity of high-quality long CoT training data. Existing multimodal datasets and CoT synthesis methods still suffer from limited reasoning depth, modality conversion errors, and rigid generation pipelines, hindering model performance and stability. To this end, in this paper, we propose SynSelect, a novel three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework for generating high-quality long CoT data tailored to multimodal reasoning tasks. Specifically, SynSelect first leverages multiple heterogeneous multimodal LRMs to produce diverse candidate CoTs, and then applies both instance and batch level selection to filter high-quality CoTs that can effectively enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models supervised fine-tuned on SynSelect-generated data significantly outperform baselines and achieve further improvements after reinforcement learning post-training. Our results validate SynSelect as an effective approach for advancing multimodal LRMs reasoning capabilities."}

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel OR-Guided \"Pretrain-then-Reinforce\" framework. To provide structured guidance, we propose a simulation-augmented OR model that generates high-quality reference decisions, implicitly capturing complex business constraints and managerial preferences. Leveraging these OR-derived decisions as foundational training labels, we design a domain-informed deep learning foundation model to establish foundational decision-making capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning stage. Uniquely, we position RL as a deep alignment mechanism that enables the AI agent to internalize the optimality principles of OR, while simultaneously leveraging exploration for general policy refinement and allowing expert guidance for scenario-specific adaptation (e.g., promotional events). Validated through extensive numerical experiments and a field deployment at JD.com augmented by a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, our model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, delivering real-world gains of a 5.27-day reduction in turnover and a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, alongside a 29.95% decrease in holding costs. Contrary to the prevailing trend of brute-force model scaling, our study demonstrates that a lightweight, domain-informed model can deliver state-of-the-art performance and robust transferability when guided by structured OR logic. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective paradigm for intelligent supply chain management, highlighting the value of deeply aligning AI with OR."}

Perhaps they don't need to. We propose recontextualization, which reduces how often language models \"game\" training signals, performing misbehaviors those signals mistakenly reinforce. We show recontextualization prevents models from learning to 1) prioritize evaluation metrics over chat response quality; 2) special-case code to pass incorrect tests; 3) lie to users; and 4) become sycophantic. Our method works by generating completions from prompts discouraging misbehavior and then recontextualizing them as though they were in response to prompts permitting misbehavior. Recontextualization trains language models to resist misbehavior even when instructions permit it. This mitigates the reinforcement of misbehavior from misspecified training signals, reducing specification gaming without improving the supervision signal."}

Unlike prior approaches that treat generation and validation as separate stages, VIGOR+ establishes an iterative feedback mechanism: validation signals from CEVAE (including information gain, latent consistency metrics, and diagnostic messages) are transformed into natural language feedback that guides subsequent LLM generation rounds. This iterative refinement continues until convergence criteria are met. We formalize the feedback mechanism, prove convergence properties under mild assumptions, and provide a complete algorithmic framework."}

The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize."}
