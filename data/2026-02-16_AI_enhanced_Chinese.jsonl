Although large language models can synthesize functionally correct CUDA code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices. We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels.

While models typically follow these character specifications, they can occasionally violate them in large-scale deployments. In this work, we aim to identify types of queries that are likely to produce such character violations at deployment, using much less than deployment-level compute. To do this, we introduce abstractive red-teaming, where we search for natural-language query categories, e.g. \"The query is in Chinese. The query asks about family roles,\" that routinely elicit violations. These categories abstract over the many possible variants of a query which could appear in the wild. We introduce two algorithms for efficient category search against a character-trait-specific reward model: one based on reinforcement learning on a category generator LLM, and another which leverages a strong LLM to iteratively synthesize categories from high-scoring queries. Across a 12-principle character specification and 7 target models, we find that our algorithms consistently outperform baselines, and generate qualitatively interesting categories; for example, queries which ask Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to predict the future lead to responses saying that AI will dominate humanity, and queries that ask GPT-4.1-Mini for essential prison survival items lead to enthusiastic recommendation of illegal weapons.

Preprint", "summary": "The widespread availability of fine-tuned LoRA modules for open pre-trained models has led to an interest in methods that can adaptively merge LoRAs to improve performance. These methods typically include some way of selecting LoRAs from a pool and tune merging coefficients based on a task-specific dataset. While adaptive merging methods have demonstrated improvements in some settings, no past work has attempted to recycle LoRAs found \"in the wild\" on model repositories like the Hugging Face Hub. To address this gap, we consider recycling from a pool of nearly 1,000 user-contributed LoRAs trained from the Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct language model. Our empirical study includes a range of adaptive and non-adaptive merging methods in addition to a new method designed via a wide search over the methodological design space. We demonstrate that adaptive merging methods can improve performance over the base model but provide limited benefit over training a new LoRA on the same data used to set merging coefficients. We additionally find not only that the specific choice of LoRAs to merge has little importance, but that using LoRAs with randomly initialized parameter values yields similar performance. This raises the possibility that adaptive merging from recycled LoRAs primarily works via some kind of regularization effect, rather than by enabling positive cross-task transfer. To better understand why past work has proven successful, we confirm that positive transfer is indeed possible when there are highly relevant LoRAs in the pool.

To establish a shared semantic latent space, the transmitters/receivers in TokenCom need to agree on an identical tokenizer model and codebook. To this end, an initial Tokenizer Agreement (TA) process is carried out in each communication episode, where the transmitter/receiver cooperate to choose from a set of pre-trained tokenizer models/ codebooks available to them both for efficient TokenCom. In this correspondence, we investigate TA in a multi-user downlink wireless TokenCom scenario, where the base station equipped with multiple antennas transmits video token streams to multiple users. We formulate the corresponding mixed-integer non-convex problem, and propose a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates a deep Q-network (DQN) for joint tokenizer agreement and sub-channel assignment, with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for beamforming.

The presence of a quasiperiodic potential renders the problem analytically tractable and enables a controlled study of the interplay between monitoring and disorder. We develop an analytical description based on an instantaneous Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a measurement-induced effective potential constructed self-consistently from individual quantum trajectories, without relying on postselection. In the quantum Zeno regime, an emergent dominant energy scale reduces the problem to a transfer-matrix formulation of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which allows direct computation of the Lyapunov exponent. Complementarily, we extract the localization length numerically from long-time steady-state quantum state diffusion trajectories by reconstructing the intrinsic localized single-particle wave functions and analyzing their spatial decay. These numerical results show quantitative agreement with the effective theory predictions, with controlled corrections of order $J^2/[\u03bb^2+(\u03b3/2)^2]$ (where $J$ is the hopping amplitude, $\u03b3$ the measurement strength, and $\u03bb$ the quasiperiodic potential). Our results underscore the connection between the effective non-Hermitian description and the stochastic monitored dynamics, showing the interplay between Zeno-like localization, coherent hopping, and quasiperiodic-disorder-induced localization, while also laying the groundwork for understanding and exploiting measurement-induced localization as a tool for quantum control and state preparation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0b\u4e00\u7ef4\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u829d\u8bfa\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u65e0\u5e8f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u829d\u8bfa regime \u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u52bf\u573a\u4e0b\u8fde\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5b50\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u4e0e\u65e0\u5e8f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8f68\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u8ba1\u7b97\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u6307\u6570\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6269\u6563\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u91cd\u6784\u672c\u5f81\u5c40\u57df\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7a7a\u95f4\u8870\u51cf\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u829d\u8bfa regime \u4e0b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u5b9a\u91cf\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u957f\u5ea6\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u7cbe\u786e\u81f3 J\u00b2/[\u03bb\u00b2+(\u03b3/2)\u00b2] \u9636\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf-\u76f8\u5e72-\u65e0\u5e8f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u4e0e\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u65e0\u5e8f\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7684\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5236\u5907\u548c\u64cd\u63a7\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u95f4\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

This lattice exhibits three completely flat, non-dispersive bands in the band structure in the absence of magnetic flux due to destructive interference in the electron hoppings, leading to the emergence of compact localized states (CLS). These CLS are analytically constructed and exhibit real-space confinement of the electrons, arising solely due to the lattice's geometrical frustration. It has been shown that these FBs are very robust against the introduction of weak random onsite disorder in the system. By tuning the uniform magnetic flux threaded through the diamond plaquettes, we demonstrate a tunable evolution of the band structure and show that certain bands develop nontrivial topological features with nonzero integer values of the Chern number. Additionally, we have computed the multi-terminal transport properties for this 2D lattice system, which display the flux-tunable resonances and transmission suppression linked to the FBs, establishing a clear interplay between the localization, topology, and transport.

Accepted for publication at INFOCOM 2026 Quantum Networked Applications and Protocols (QuNAP). This work was funded by the Danish National Research Foundation (DNRF) through the Center CLASSIQUE", "summary": "Quantum teleportation is a foundational protocol for sending quantum information through entanglement distribution and classical communication. Assuming ideal classical communication, the reliability of quantum teleportation is limited by the fidelity of the shared EPR pairs. This reliability can be improved through two mechanisms: entanglement purification and quantum error correction (QEC). Using both techniques in concert requires flexible QEC rates, since purification alters the structure of errors induced by imperfect-EPR teleportation, and fixed-rate codes cannot be uniformly effective across purification regimes or reliability targets. In this work, we supplement purification with punctured QEC codes, providing a family of code variants that can be adapted to error-channel characteristics and reliability targets. Punctured codes improve teleportation reliability across a broader range of purification regimes, enabling target reliability to be met without hardware-level code switching. This is corroborated by numerical results, showing that different punctured codes achieve the lowest logical error probability in different operating regimes, and that selecting among them reduces logical error relative to fixed-rate encoded teleportation. This reduction relaxes the requirement on the initial EPR fidelity or purification needed to achieve a target reliability.

Such problems are naturally modeled by alternating quantifiers and, therefore, lie beyond $\\sf NP$, typically in the polynomial hierarchy or $\\sf PSPACE$. Despite extensive study of these problem classes, relatively few natural completeness results are known at these higher levels. We introduce a general framework for proving completeness in the polynomial hierarchy and $\\sf PSPACE$ for problems derived from $\\sf NP$. Our approach is based on a refinement of $\\sf NP$, which we call $\\sf NP$ with solutions ($\\sf NP$-$\\sf S$), in which solutions are explicit combinatorial objects, together with a restricted class of reductions -- solution-embedding reductions -- that preserve solution structure. We define $\\sf NP$-$\\sf S$-completeness and show that a large collection of classical $\\sf NP$-complete problems, including Clique, Vertex Cover, Knapsack, and Traveling Salesman, are $\\sf NP$-$\\sf S$-complete.\n  Using this framework, we establish general meta-theorems showing that if a problem is $\\sf NP$-$\\sf S$-complete, then its natural two-level extensions are $\u03a3_2^p$-complete, its three-level extensions are $\u03a3_3^p$-complete, and its $k$-level extensions are $\u03a3_k^p$-complete. When the number of levels is unbounded, the resulting problems are $\\sf PSPACE$-complete.

In the weakly chaotic regime, we identify spin-coherent states placed at the edge of the regular islands in the mixed classical phase space as optimal initial states for enhanced sensitivity. On the other hand, in the strongly chaotic regime, $I_\u03b1$ is insensitive to the choice of the initial state.

However, existing AI safety benchmarks largely evaluate single agents, leaving multi-agent risks such as coordination failure and conflict poorly understood. We introduce GT-HarmBench, a benchmark of 2,009 high-stakes scenarios spanning game-theoretic structures such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Stag Hunt and Chicken. Scenarios are drawn from realistic AI risk contexts in the MIT AI Risk Repository. Across 15 frontier models, agents choose socially beneficial actions in only 62% of cases, frequently leading to harmful outcomes. We measure sensitivity to game-theoretic prompt framing and ordering, and analyze reasoning patterns driving failures.

We address both issues by developing a principled framework that derives quasi-probabilities and their conditional calculus from structural consistency requirements on how statements are valued across different universes of discourse, understood as finite Boolean algebras of statements.We begin with a universal valuation that assigns definite (possibly complex) values to all statements. The central concept is Syntactic Locality: every universe can be embedded within a larger ambient one, and the universal valuation must behave coherently under such embeddings and restrictions. From a set of structural principles, we prove a representation theorem showing that every admissible valuation can be re-expressed as a finitely additive measure on mutually exclusive statements, mirroring the usual probability sum rule. We call such additive representatives pre-probabilities. This representation is unique up to an additive regraduation freedom. When this freedom can be fixed canonically, pre-probabilities reduce to finite quasi-probabilities, thereby elevating quasi-probability theory from a computational device to a uniquely determined additive representation of universal valuations. Classical finite probabilities arise as the subclass of quasi-probabilities stable under relativisation, i.e., closed under restriction to sub-universes. Finally, the same framework enables us to define a coherent theory of conditionals, yielding a well-defined generalized Bayes' theorem applicable to both pre-probabilities and quasi-probabilities.

This neglects that it is futile to preserve a predatory species if we do not also preserve at least a subset of the prey it feeds on. Thus, in the Optimizing PD with Dependencies ($\u03b5$-PDD) problem, we are additionally given a food web that represents the predator-prey relationships between species. The goal is to save a set of k species of maximum phylogenetic diversity such that for every saved species, at least one of its prey is also saved. This problem is NP-hard even when the phylogenetic tree is a star. The $\u03b1$-PDD problem alters PDD by requiring that at least some fraction $\u03b1$ of the prey of every saved species are also saved. In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of $\u03b1$-PDD. We prove that the problem is W[1]-hard and in XP when parameterized by the solution size k, the diversity threshold D, or their complements. When parameterized by the vertex cover number of the food web, $\u03b1$-PDD is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). A key measure of the computational difficulty of a problem that is FPT is the size of the smallest kernel that can be obtained. We prove that, when parameterized by the distance to clique, 1-PDD admits a linear kernel. Our main contribution is to prove that $\u03b1$-PDD does not admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the vertex cover number plus the diversity threshold D, even if the phylogenetic tree is a star.

The associated critical parameters including the critical electric field, spatial and temporal scales of the electrohydrodynamic instability of molten apexes are obtained by proposing the workflows that utilize the atomistic models in ED-MD simulations to calculate kinematic viscosity tensor components and mass density spatial distributions for the nanomelts with electric fields. Our current ED-MD simulations for nanotips show a non-monotonical variation of the time delay versus the electric field frequency for metal nanotips, and the presence of a critical rf electric field amplitude triggering the thermal runaway regardless of the field frequency. The calculated mass densities and kinematic viscosities of nanomelts for metal nanotips are found to be drastically different to those of bulk liquid metals at the melting point. Specifically, the viscosity of nanomelt under the rf electric field is revealed to be several orders of magnitude higher than the bulk liquid metal, resulting in substantial increase of spatial and temporal scales in the instability theory of electrocapillary wave within the viscosity-dominated regime, compared to the results of ED-MD simulations for Cu and Ti metals, while good agreement between the two methods on the critical wavelength and time delay of thermal runway is found for W nanotips.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528ED-MD\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7535\u6bdb\u7ec6\u6ce2\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u7eb3\u7c73\u91d1\u5c5e\u5c16\u7aef\u5728\u5c04\u9891\u7535\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u53d8\u4e0e\u70ed\u5931\u63a7\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7eb3\u7c73\u7194\u4f53\u7c98\u5ea6\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4f53\u76f8\u7194\u4f53\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7535 hydrodynamic \u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u7a7a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91d1\u5c5e\u5c16\u7aef\u5728\u5c04\u9891\u7535\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u53d8\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u70ed\u5931\u63a7\u4e34\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7eb3\u7c73\u7194\u4f53\u7684\u7535\u6bdb\u7ec6\u6ce2\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4e34\u754c\u7535\u573a\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0e\u4f53\u76f8\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08ED-MD\uff09\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u7535\u6bdb\u7ec6\u6ce2\u52a8\u6001\u5931\u7a33\u7406\u8bba\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u7eb3\u7c73\u7194\u4f53\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7c98\u5ea6\u5f20\u91cf\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5173\u8054\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "result": "1. \u7eb3\u7c73\u5c16\u7aef\u70ed\u5931\u63a7\u5b58\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u5c04\u9891\u7535\u573a\u5e45\u503c\uff08\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u65e0\u5173\uff09\uff1b2. \u7eb3\u7c73\u7194\u4f53\u7c98\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f53\u76f8\u7194\u4f53\u9ad8\u6570\u4e2a\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7535\u6bdb\u7ec6\u6ce2\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u7a7a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u589e\u5927\uff1b3.

Focusing on the class of coherent MWNs, we provide a novel characterization of coherence in terms of node-dependent orthonormal matrices, showing that link transformations can be written as relative rotations between nodes. This representation allows us to deal with coherent MWNs of any size and to introduce an orthonormal change of variables capable to reduce diffusion on a coherent MWN to diffusion on a standard weighted network with scalar weights. Building on this, we extend the classical Turing instability analysis to MWNs and derive the conditions under which a homogeneous equilibrium of the local dynamics loses stability due to matrix-weighted diffusion.

We argue that effective opioid policy evaluation requires three capabilities -- forecasting future outcomes under current policies, counterfactual reasoning about alternative past decisions, and optimization over candidate interventions -- and propose to unify them through world modeling. We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPolicy4OOD\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00 opioid \u653f\u7b56\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u5371\u673a\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u6700\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5371\u673a\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u98ce\u9669\u9014\u5f84\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u653e\u5927\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPolicy4OOD\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u653f\u7b56\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u5dde\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u653f\u7b56\u6761\u4ef6Transformer\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765opioid\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u8be5\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u653f\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u653f\u7b56\u77e5\u8bc6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30opioid\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

While many existing QRL studies apply quantum agents to classical environments, it has been realized that the potential advantages of QRL are most naturally explored in environments that exhibit intrinsically quantum characteristics, where the agent's observations and interactions arise from quantum processes. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning environment formulated as a challenge-response task with hidden information. In the proposed environment, Alice encodes a classical bit into the parameters of a quantum circuit, while Bob, with a trained reinforcement learning agent, interacts with a limited number of quantum state copies to infer the hidden bit. The agent must select measurement strategies and decide when to terminate the interaction under explicit resource constraints. To study the solvability of the proposed environment, we consider three agents: a purely classical agent, a lightweight hybrid agent and a deep hybrid agent. Through experiments, we analyze the trade-off between inference accuracy and quantum resource consumption under varying interaction penalties. Our results show that the lightweight hybrid agent achieves reliable inference using as few as two quantum state copies, outperforming both the classical baseline and the deep hybrid agent in highly resource-constrained regimes.

While Iterative Conditional Expectation (ICE) G-computation offers a principled approach, its recursive structure suffers from error propagation, corrupting the learned outcome regression models. We propose D3-Net, a framework that mitigates error propagation in ICE training and then applies a robust final correction. First, to interrupt error propagation during learning, we train the ICE sequence using Sequential Doubly Robust (SDR) pseudo-outcomes, which provide bias-corrected targets for each regression. Second, we employ a multi-task Transformer with a covariate simulator head for auxiliary supervision, regularizing representations against corruption by noisy pseudo-outcomes, and a target network to stabilize training dynamics.

For such transitions the Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold determined by the Lee-Yang zeros, the order parameter $\\mathcal{P}$ as the $d$-volume of the Fermi sea, and the special FST universality class were introduced in [1]. The exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) $d$-dimensional ($d=1,2,3$) model of interacting fermions is analyzed. We explore the relation between the Lee-Yang zeros, the Luttinger and the plateau (Oshikawa) theorems. The validity of the Luttinger theorem in the HK model is confirmed. It is shown that the order parameter $\\mathcal{P}$ and the FST universality class describe the transitions between metal and band/Mott insulators, as well as the Lifshitz and van Hove gapless-to-gapless transitions. The gapless phases are established to be the Landau Fermi liquids (metals). In addition to the conventional paradigm with a continuous order parameter, we apply the homology theory to analyze the FST transitions. They are critical points of the Morse function. To quantify FST we use the Euler characteristic, which is calculated for each phase of the HK model.

The goal of the local quantum architecture search algorithm is to optimize parametrized quantum circuit architectures through a local, probabilistic search over a fixed set of gate-level actions applied to existing circuits. We evaluate the local quantum architecture search algorithm on two synthetic function-fitting regression tasks and two quantum chemistry regression datasets, including the BSE49 dataset of bond separation energies for first- and second-row elements and a dataset of water conformers generated using the data-driven coupled-cluster approach.

On the other hand, computationally efficient algorithms for learning Gibbs distributions rely on access to full sample configurations generated from the model. For many systems of interest that arise in physical contexts, expecting a full sample to be observed is not practical, and hence it is important to look for computationally efficient methods that solve the learning problem with access to only a limited set of statistics. We examine the trade-offs between the power of computation and observation within this scenario, employing the Ising model as a paradigmatic example. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reconstruct the model parameters for a model with $\\ell_1$ width $\u03b3$ by observing statistics up to an order of $O(\u03b3)$. This approach allows us to infer the model's structure and also learn its couplings and magnetic fields.

We study the task of reconstructing the Pauli-signal matrix $S_{ij}=\\text{Tr}(O_i \u03c1(t_j))$ for a collection of $M$ low-weight Pauli observables $\\{O_i\\}_{i=1}^M$ over $N$ timesteps $\\{t_j\\}_{j=1}^N$, while minimizing the total number of device shots. We propose a Compressed Sensing Shadow Tomography (CSST) protocol that combines two complementary reductions. First, local classical shadows reduce the observable dimension by enabling many Pauli expectation values to be estimated from the same randomized snapshots at a fixed time. Second, compressed sensing reduces the time dimension by exploiting the fact that many expectation-value traces are spectrally sparse or compressible in a unitary (e.g., Fourier) transform basis. Operationally, CSST samples $m\\ll N$ timesteps uniformly at random, collects shadows only at those times, and then reconstructs each length-$N$ signal via standard $\\ell_1$-based recovery in the unitary transform domain. We provide end-to-end guarantees that explicitly combine shadow estimation error with compressed sensing recovery bounds. For exactly $s$-sparse signals in a unitary transform basis, we show that $m=O \\left(s\\log^2 s \\log N\\right)$ random timesteps suffice (with high probability), leading to total-shot savings scaling as $\\widetilde\u0398(N/s)$ (i.e., up to polylogarithmic factors) relative to collecting shadows at all $N$ timesteps. For approximately sparse signals, the reconstruction error decomposes into a compressibility (tail) term plus a noise term.

But while it is well established that stabilizer codes in higher spatial dimensions gain additional levels of intrinsic robustness, higher-dimensional Floquet codes have hitherto been explored only in limited scope. Here we introduce a 3d generalization of a Floquet code whose instantaneous stabilizer group realizes a 3d fermionic toric code, while crucially preserving all three logical qubits throughout the entire measurement sequence. One central ingredient is the identification of a 3d lattice geometry that generalizes the features of the Kekul\u00e9 lattice underlying the 2d Hastings-Haah code - specifically, a structure where deleting any one edge color yields a two-color subgraph that decomposes into short, closed loops rather than homologically nontrivial chains. This loop property avoids the collapse of logical information that plagues naive sequential two-color measurement schedules on many 3d lattices. Although, for our lattice geometry, a simple 3-round cycle that sequentially measures the three types of parity checks does not expose the full error syndrome set, we show that one can append a measurement sequence to extract the missing syndromes without disturbing the logical subspace. Beyond code design, 3d tricoordinated lattice geometries define a family of 3d monitored Kitaev models, in which random measurements of the non-commuting parity checks give rise to dynamically created entangled phases with nontrivial topology. In discussing the general structure of their underlying phase diagrams and, in particular, the existence of certain quantum critical points, we again make a connection to the general preservation of logical information in time-ordered Floquet protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u6b8a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e09\u914d\u4f4d\u6676\u683c\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4Floquet\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\uff0c\u8be5\u7801\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u903b\u8f91\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u76d1\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4Floquet\u7801\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u4e09\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u5728\u987a\u5e8f\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u903b\u8f91\u4fe1\u606f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e8c\u7ef4Hastings-Haah Kekul\u00e9\u6676\u683c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4e09\u7ef4\u4e09\u914d\u4f4d\u6676\u683c\uff0c\u5176\u7279\u70b9\u662f\u5220\u9664\u4efb\u610f\u8fb9\u989c\u8272\u90fd\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u77ed\u95ed\u5408\u56de\u8def\u800c\u975e\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u94fe\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fdd\u6301\u4e09\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u9644\u52a0\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u4e0d\u6270\u52a8\u903b\u8f91\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u53d6\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6676\u683c\u7684\u73af\u8def\u7ed3\u6784\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u4fe1\u606f\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u9644\u52a0\u6d4b\u91cf\u534f\u8bae\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u53d6\u5b8c\u6574\u9519\u8bef\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u903b\u8f91\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u8fd8\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u76d1\u6d4bKitaev\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u6676\u683c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4Floquet\u7801\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53cc\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u76d1\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u548c\u4e34\u754c\u73b0\u8c61\u5b58\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}

While recent quantum algorithms have enabled efficient quantum preparation of thermal states, observable estimation via sampling remains costly: a straightforward implementation separates successive measurements by a full mixing time in order to ensure samples are approximately independent. In this work, we show that the sampling cost can be substantially reduced by using a single Gibbs-sampling trajectory. After a single burn-in period, we interleave coherent measurements that satisfy detailed balance with respect to the target Gibbs state. The efficiency of this approach rests on the fact that, in many settings, the autocorrelation time can be significantly shorter than the mixing time. For energy estimation (and more generally for observables commuting with the Hamiltonian), we implement the required measurements using Gaussian-filtered quantum phase estimation with only logarithmic overhead.

However, such algorithms often rely on rigid modeling assumptions and can perform poorly when demand distributions shift or relevant contextual information is unavailable. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have generated interest in AI agents that can reason flexibly and incorporate rich contextual signals, but it remains unclear how best to incorporate LLM-based methods into traditional decision-making pipelines.\n  We study how OR algorithms, LLMs, and humans can interact and complement each other in a multi-period inventory control setting. We construct InventoryBench, a benchmark of over 1,000 inventory instances spanning both synthetic and real-world demand data, designed to stress-test decision rules under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. Through this benchmark, we find that OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, suggesting that these methods are complementary rather than substitutes.\n  We further investigate the role of humans through a controlled classroom experiment that embeds LLM recommendations into a human-in-the-loop decision pipeline. Contrary to prior findings that human-AI collaboration can degrade performance, we show that, on average, human-AI teams achieve higher profits than either humans or AI agents operating alone. Beyond this population-level finding, we formalize an individual-level complementarity effect and derive a distribution-free lower bound on the fraction of individuals who benefit from AI collaboration; empirically, we find this fraction to be substantial.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u591a\u5468\u671f\u5e93\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u534f\u540c\u4e92\u8865\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaInventoryBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8bfe\u5802\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0OR\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u56e2\u961f\u5229\u6da6\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u4eba\u7c7b\u6216AI\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e09\u8005\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u5e93\u5b58\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60c5\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u5907\u7075\u6d3b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u660e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22OR\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001LLMs\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u534f\u4f5c\u800c\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b1000\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684InventoryBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u9700\u6c42\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u63d0\u524d\u671f\u4e0b\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4OR\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u5d4c\u5165LLM\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u8bfe\u5802\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "OR\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4efb\u4e00\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u56e2\u961f\u5e73\u5747\u5229\u6da6\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u4eba\u7c7b\u6216AI\uff1b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u80fd\u4eceAI\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6bd4\u4f8b\u76f8\u5f53\u53ef\u89c2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u5e93\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u662f\u4e92\u8865\u5173\u7cfb\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5c06LLM\u4e0eOR\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our main contributions are twofold: first, we establish a criterion for the uniqueness of steady states. The criterion is formulated in terms of the algebra generated by the GKSL generators and provides a necessary and sufficient condition when the generators are analytic functions of time. We demonstrate the utility of our criterion through prototypical examples, including quantum many-body spin chains. Second, we extend the concept of strong symmetry for time-dependent GKSL equations by introducing two distinct forms, strong symmetry in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture and that in the interaction picture, and completely classify the asymptotic dynamics with them. More concretely, we rigorously uncover that the strong symmetry in the interaction picture is responsible for non-trivial time-dependent steady states, such as coherent oscillations, whereas that in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture controls the existence of time-independent steady states. This classification not only encompasses established mechanisms underlying non-trivial oscillatory steady states, such as strong dynamical symmetry and Floquet dynamical symmetry, but also reveals symmetry-predicted, time-dependent asymptotic dynamics in a novel class of open quantum systems. Our framework thus provides a rigorous foundation for controlling dissipative quantum systems in a time-dependent manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u51c6\u5468\u671fGKSL\u65b9\u7a0b\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5206\u7c7b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5143\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u5224\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5f3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed8\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\uff1a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7ed8\u666f\u5f3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u542b\u65f6\u7a33\u6001\uff08\u5982\u76f8\u5e72\u632f\u8361\uff09\uff0c\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u7ed8\u666f\u5f3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u65e0\u5173\u7a33\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u542b\u65f6\u8017\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u51c6\u5468\u671fGKSL\u65b9\u7a0b\u6e10\u8fd1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e14\u5f3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u542b\u65f6\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u6001\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5143\u4ee3\u6570\u5efa\u7acb\u7a33\u6001\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u5224\u636e\uff1b\u5c06\u5f3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u542b\u65f6GKSL\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b9a\u4e49\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u7ed8\u666f\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7ed8\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "1. \u83b7\u5f97\u89e3\u6790\u542b\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5143\u4e0b\u7a33\u6001\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5224\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u7b49\u5178\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b2. \u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7ed8\u666f\u5f3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u662f\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u542b\u65f6\u7a33\u6001\uff08\u5982\u76f8\u5e72\u632f\u8361\uff09\u7684\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u7ed8\u666f\u5f3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u65f6\u95f4\u65e0\u5173\u7a33\u6001\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff1b3. \u7edf\u4e00\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5f3a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548cFloquet\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7b49\u5df2\u6709\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u65f6\u53d8\u65b9\u5f0f\u8c03\u63a7\u8017\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u53ef\u6307\u5bfc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u6e10\u8fd1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u6676\u4f53\u6216\u7a33\u5b9a\u632f\u8361\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u91cf\u5b50\u8c03\u63a7\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We define Sperner states -- a broad class of states where apparent multipartite entanglement decomposes into fewer-partite entanglement among subsystems of each party. Each class of Sperner states is associated with one antichain hypergraph and each hypergraph encodes the maximal entanglement structure permissible under its constraints. We introduce a Multi-entanglement Measure Space (MEMS) where each Sperner class corresponds to a linear subspace defined by the vanishing of specific linear combinations of bipartite and multipartite measures. The nonvanishing of such combinations signals multipartite entanglement beyond the associated hypergraph, thereby distinguishing entanglement structures. We build a two way connection between each hypergraph entanglement structure and a distinct set of combinations, thereby quantifying the entanglement pattern and providing a unified basis for classifying all multipartite entanglement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eSperner\u6001\u3001\u53cd\u94fe\u8d85\u56fe\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea0\u7f20\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea0\u7f20\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u53cc\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49Sperner\u6001\uff08\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5404\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u95f4\u5c11\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u6001\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2aSperner\u7c7b\u4e0e\u53cd\u94fe\u8d85\u56fe\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7ea0\u7f20\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08MEMS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u65b9\u7ea0\u7f20\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u8d85\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7ea0\u7f20\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7ec4\u5408\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u6bcf\u4e2aSperner\u7c7b\u5bf9\u5e94MEMS\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u6027\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6d88\u5931\u4e0e\u5426\u53ef\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u5426\u8d85\u8d8a\u8be5\u8d85\u56fe\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7cbe\u786e\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea0\u7f20\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7ea0\u7f20\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7ec4\u5408\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency.

Our generators isolate distinct competencies and failure modes: (i) contradiction-cycle UNSAT cores with controllable size and imbalance, (ii) SAT instances with a prescribed fraction of free variables to control solution multiplicity, (iii) planted backbones that modulate propagation, (iv) late bridge clauses that couple otherwise monotone regions to probe sensitivity to ordering and revision, and (v) symmetry/duplication variants that test abstraction under renaming and redundant structure. We evaluate LLM-based reasoners on decision accuracy and assignment validity, and quantify robustness under semantics-preserving perturbations such as clause reordering, filler clauses, and variable renaming.

However, despite the continued rise in design complexity, advances in AMS automation remain limited. This reflects the central challenge in developing a generalized optimization method applicable across diverse circuit design spaces, many of which are distinct, constrained, and non-differentiable. To address this, our work casts circuit design as a graph generation problem and introduces a novel method of AMS synthesis driven by deep reinforcement learning (AstRL). Based on a policy-gradient approach, AstRL generates circuits directly optimized for user-specified targets within a simulator-embedded environment that provides ground-truth feedback during training. Through behavioral-cloning and discriminator-based similarity rewards, our method demonstrates, for the first time, an expert-aligned paradigm for generalized circuit generation validated in simulation. Importantly, the proposed approach operates at the level of individual transistors, enabling highly expressive, fine-grained topology generation. Strong inductive biases encoded in the action space and environment further drive structurally consistent and valid generation.

Typical decontamination filters use n-gram matching which fail to detect semantic duplicates: sentences with equivalent (or near-equivalent) content that are not close in string space. We study this soft contamination of training data by semantic duplicates. Among other experiments, we embed the Olmo3 training corpus and find that: 1) contamination remains widespread, e.g. we find semantic duplicates for 78% of CodeForces and exact duplicates for 50% of ZebraLogic problems; 2) including semantic duplicates of benchmark data in training does improve benchmark performance; and 3) when finetuning on duplicates of benchmark datapoints, performance also improves on truly-held-out datapoints from the same benchmark. We argue that recent benchmark gains are thus confounded: the prevalence of soft contamination means gains reflect both genuine capability improvements and the accumulation of test data and effective test data in growing training corpora.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793aLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u666e\u904d\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u590d\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfn-gram\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b64\u7c7b\"\u8f6f\u6c61\u67d3\"\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u82e5\u6df7\u5165\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709n-gram\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u590d\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f6f\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u6790Olmo3\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u590d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8f6f\u6c61\u67d3\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "1) \u6c61\u67d3\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e25\u91cd\uff1aCodeForces\u9898\u76ee78%\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u590d\uff0cZebraLogic\u95ee\u989850%\u5b58\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u590d\uff1b2) \u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u590d\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff1b3) \u5728\u91cd\u590d\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u540c\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd1\u671f\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u90e8\u5206\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7eaf\u7cb9\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8fd9\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We argue that operationalizing XAI requires treating explainability as an information systems problem where user interaction demands induce specific system requirements. We introduce X-SYS, a reference architecture for interactive explanation systems, that guides (X)AI researchers, developers and practitioners in connecting interactive explanation user interfaces (XUI) with system capabilities. X-SYS organizes around four quality attributes named STAR (scalability, traceability, responsiveness, and adaptability), and specifies a five-component decomposition (XUI Services, Explanation Services, Model Services, Data Services, Orchestration and Governance). It maps interaction patterns to system capabilities to decouple user interface evolution from backend computation. We implement X-SYS through SemanticLens, a system for semantic search and activation steering in vision-language models. SemanticLens demonstrates how contract-based service boundaries enable independent evolution, offline/online separation ensures responsiveness, and persistent state management supports traceability.

Low-rank factorization offers a promising route to reduce training and inference costs, but the community lacks a stable recipe for training models from scratch using exclusively low-rank weights while matching the performance of the dense model. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be trained from scratch using exclusively low-rank factorized weights for all non-embedding matrices without auxiliary \"full-rank\" guidance required by prior methods. While native low-rank training often suffers from instability and loss spikes, we identify uncontrolled growth in the spectral norm (largest singular value) of the weight matrix update as the dominant factor. To address this, we introduce Spectron: Spectral renormalization with orthogonalization, which dynamically bounds the resultant weight updates based on the current spectral norms of the factors. Our method enables stable, end-to-end factorized training with negligible overhead.

Correa", "Jonas Glatthard", "Andrew D. Armour", "Gerardo Adesso"], "title": "Equilibrium thermometry in the multilevel quantum Rabi model", "comment": "15 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "The temperature sensitivity of a probe in equilibrium can be gauged by its thermal quantum Fisher information (QFI). It is known that probes exhibiting degeneracy in their energy-level structure can achieve larger sensitivities, while probes with a more uniform spectrum may remain sensitive over a broader temperature range. Here, we study the thermometric performance of a multilevel quantum Rabi model in which two well-separated atomic manifolds of near-degenerate levels couple to a single cavity mode. We generalise the standard quantum Rabi treatment in the adiabatic regime to find an approximate closed-form expression for the thermal QFI. We then characterise two complementary limits. On the one hand, a large dark-state manifold (dark-manifold saturation) produces a robust peak in thermal sensitivity due to bright--dark population transfer. Such increase in sensitivity is further maximised at an intermediate light--matter coupling strength. Maximising instead the number of bright states (bright-manifold saturation) generates a broadband thermal response that becomes increasingly stable under random light--matter couplings as the number of levels is increased.

This method enables efficient extraction of the ion's phonon occupation number following sub-Doppler cooling close to the motional ground state. The proposed method relies on monitoring the cavity probe transmission while scanning the probe laser frequency once cavity EIT is established using the control beam, significantly simplifying the measurement procedure. We theoretically establish a model that demonstrates influence of thermal state of the trapped ion vis a vis the EIT linewidth measured. We show how the cavity EIT transmission may be used as a thermometry tool to deduce the ion temperature as well as the motional state for an ion in the sub-Doppler cooling regime. The current method can only be used for operation in the resolved-sideband regime, where individual motional states can be selectively addressed for all relevant transitions either by selecting appropriate energy levels for the three-level system or by employing strong confinement with high secular frequencies ($\\sim 10 MHz$).", "AI": {"tldr": "A cavity-based EIT technique for measuring ion temperature and phonon occupation near motional ground state, using cavity probe transmission scanning in strong coupling regime.", "motivation": "Existing ion thermometry methods lack efficiency for sub-Doppler cooled ions near ground state; this technique simplifies measurement by leveraging cavity EIT to extract phonon occupation.", "method": "Monitor cavity probe transmission while scanning probe laser frequency after establishing cavity EIT with control beam; correlate EIT linewidth with ion's thermal state.", "result": "Theoretical model links EIT linewidth to ion temperature and motional phonon state; enables thermometry in sub-Doppler cooling regime via transmission analysis.", "conclusion": "Valid only in resolved-sideband regime (secular frequencies ~10 MHz) where motional states are selectively addressable; provides simplified ground-state ion thermometry."}}

We prove that observing a deterministic policy that is optimal for any non-constant reward function then conveys exactly $n \\log m$ bits of information about the environment. Specifically, we show that the mutual information between the environment and the optimal policy is $n \\log m$ bits.

Gate-by-gate compilation often yields deep circuits, requiring significant overhead to ensure fault-tolerance. As an alternative, we investigate the compilation of primitives from quantum simulation as single blocks. We focus our study on the [[n,n-2,2]] code family, which allows for the exhaustive comparison of potential compilation primitives on small circuit instances. Based upon that, we then introduce a methodology that lifts these primitives into size-invariant, depth-efficient compilation strategies. This recovers known methods for circuits with moderate Hadamard counts and yields improved realizations for sparse and dense placements. Simulations show significant error-rate reductions in the compiled circuits. We envision the approach as a core component of peephole-based compilers.

We evaluate nine frontier reasoning models under adversarial attacks. Our findings reveal that reasoning confers meaningful but incomplete robustness: most reasoning models studied significantly outperform instruction-tuned baselines, yet all exhibit distinct vulnerability profiles, with misleading suggestions universally effective and social pressure showing model-specific efficacy. Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures. We further demonstrate that Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), effective for standard LLMs, fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces; counterintuitively, random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction. Our results highlight that reasoning capabilities do not automatically confer adversarial robustness and that confidence-based defenses require fundamental redesign for reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e5d\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e94\u79cd\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6548\u751a\u81f3\u9002\u5f97\u5176\u53cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u6297\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5bf9\u4e5d\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\uff08CARG\uff09\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1a\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u5efa\u8bae\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u538b\u529b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u5f02\u3002\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u81ea\u6211\u6000\u7591\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u987a\u4ece\u3001\u5efa\u8bae\u52ab\u6301\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u6613\u611f\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u75b2\u52b3\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u524d\u4e24\u79cd\u5360\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\u768450%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6LLM\u7684CARG\u9632\u5fa1\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u800c\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5d4c\u5165\u53cd\u800c\u4f18\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u8d4b\u4e88\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6839\u672c\u6027\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose a regularized meta-learning framework that addresses these challenges through a four-stage pipeline combining redundancy-aware projection, statistical meta-feature augmentation, and cross-validated regularized meta-models (Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet). Our multi-metric de-duplication strategy removes near-collinear predictors using correlation and MSE thresholds ($\u03c4_{\\text{corr}}=0.95$), reducing the effective condition number of the meta-design matrix while preserving predictive diversity. Engineered ensemble statistics and interaction terms recover higher-order structure unavailable to raw prediction columns. A final inverse-RMSE blending stage mitigates regularizer-selection variance. On the Playground Series S6E1 benchmark (100K samples, 72 base models), the proposed framework achieves an out-of-fold RMSE of 8.582, improving over simple averaging (8.894) and conventional Ridge stacking (8.627), while matching greedy hill climbing (8.603) with substantially lower runtime (4 times faster). Conditioning analysis shows a 53.7\\% reduction in effective matrix condition number after redundancy projection. Comprehensive ablations demonstrate consistent contributions from de-duplication, statistical meta-features, and meta-ensemble blending. These results position regularized meta-learning as a stable and deployment-efficient stacking strategy for high-dimensional ensemble systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u5197\u4f59\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u6076\u5316\u3001\u591a\u5171\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0b\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u5143\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5143\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u572872\u4e2a\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230RMSE 8.582\uff0c\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53473.5%\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u8d2a\u5fc3\u722c\u5c71\u6cd5\u5feb4\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u81a8\u80c0\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u591a\u5171\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1)\u5197\u4f59\u611f\u77e5\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570(\u03c4_corr=0.95)\u548cMSE\u9608\u503c\u7684\u591a\u6307\u6807\u53bb\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\u79fb\u9664\u8fd1\u5171\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b2)\u7edf\u8ba1\u5143\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u96c6\u6210\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u9879\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u9ad8\u9636\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3)\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5143\u6a21\u578b(Ridge\u3001Lasso\u3001ElasticNet)\uff1b4)\u6700\u7ec8\u9006RMSE\u6df7\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\u964d\u4f4e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728Playground Series S6E1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5(10\u4e07\u6837\u672c\uff0c72\u4e2a\u57fa\u6a21\u578b)\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5916RMSE\u4e3a8.582\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u5e73\u5747(8.894)\u548c\u4f20\u7edfRidge\u5806\u53e0(8.627)\uff0c\u4e0e\u8d2a\u5fc3\u722c\u5c71\u6cd5(8.603)\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u5feb4\u500d\u3002\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6709\u6548\u77e9\u9635\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u964d\u4f4e53.7%\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53bb\u91cd\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u5143\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5143\u96c6\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5806\u53e0\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

DOI: https://doi.org/10.65109/KRAP9309", "summary": "Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a well-established form of structured argumentation. ABA frameworks with an underlying atomic language are widely studied, but their applicability is limited by a representational restriction to ground (variable-free) arguments and attacks built from propositional atoms. In this paper, we lift this restriction and propose a novel notion of constrained ABA (CABA), whose components, as well as arguments built from them, may include constrained variables, ranging over possibly infinite domains.

Traditional approaches treat it as an optimization problem, relying on per-instance heuristics or constraint-based search. We instead reframe RNA design as conditional sequence generation and introduce a reusable neural approximator, instantiated as an autoregressive language model (LM), that maps target structures directly to sequences. We first train our model in a supervised setting on random-induced structure-sequence pairs, and then use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize end-to-end metrics. We also propose methods to select a small subset for RL that greatly improves RL efficiency and quality. Across four datasets, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems on key metrics such as Boltzmann probability while being 1.7x faster, establishing conditional LM generation as a scalable, task-agnostic alternative to per-instance optimization for RNA design.

The method leverages fast, high-fidelity atom-molecule gates and high-fidelity atomic ancilla measurements to overcome the common challenges in molecule-only platforms, while preserving their diverse structural advantages. The proposed atom-molecule controlled-phase gate is based on resonant dipole-dipole exchange between a molecular rotational transition and an atomic Rydberg transition, rendering it three orders of magnitude faster than any direct molecule-molecule entangling gate. We further study several applications of our scheme including the preparation of molecular GHZ states for quantum enhanced precision measurements, the preparation of exotic molecular qudit states with topological order, and measurement-altered criticality. Our scheme is applicable to any polar molecule. It expands the paradigm of quantum logic control and paves the way to large-scale molecular entangled states.

Motivated by the limitations of classical optimal control under uncertainty and the need for interpretable decision making in safety critical aviation systems, we design a three stage Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy layer that modulates constraint radii, urgency levels, and activation decisions based on regulatory separation minima and airworthiness guidelines from FAA and EASA. These fuzzy-derived clearances are then incorporated as soft constraints into an optimal control problem solved using the FALCON toolbox and IPOPT. The framework aims to reduce unnecessary recomputations by selectively activating obstacle avoidance updates while maintaining compliance with aviation procedures. A proof of concept implementation using a simplified aircraft model demonstrates that the approach can generate optimal trajectories with computation times of 2,3 seconds per iteration in a single threaded MATLAB environment, suggesting feasibility for near real time applications. However, our experiments revealed a critical software incompatibility in the latest versions of FALCON and IPOPT, in which the Lagrangian penalty term remained identically zero, preventing proper constraint enforcement. This behavior was consistent across scenarios and indicates a solver toolbox regression rather than a modeling flaw. Future work includes validating this effect by reverting to earlier software versions, optimizing the fuzzy membership functions using evolutionary methods, and extending the system to higher fidelity aircraft models and stochastic obstacle environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u907f\u969c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u7cca\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u7ea6\u675f\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b26\u5408\u6c11\u822a\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0FALCON\u4e0eIPOPT\u6700\u65b0\u7248\u672c\u5b58\u5728\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u822a\u7a7a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b26\u5408FAA/EASA\u6cd5\u89c4\u5206\u79bb minima \u548c\u9002\u822a\u6307\u5357\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5Takagi-Sugeno-Kang\u6a21\u7cca\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5236\u7ea6\u675f\u534a\u5f84\u3001\u7d27\u6025\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u7cca\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u95f4\u9694\u8981\u6c42\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u6210\u5230FALCON\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\u548cIPOPT\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u5355\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f42.3\u79d2\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b\u4f46\u6700\u65b0\u7248\u672cFALCON\u4e0eIPOPT\u5b58\u5728\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u6052\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u56de\u5f52\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ea6\u675f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6267\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u56de\u9000\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7248\u672c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u7cca\u96b6\u5c5e\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u969c\u788d\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

With a budget of $T$ iterations, it was recently shown that an accelerated $1/T^2$ rate is possible by choosing a large step size $\u03b7= \u0398(\u03b3^2 T)$ (where $\u03b3$ is the dataset's margin) despite the resulting non-monotonicity of the loss. In this paper, we provide a tighter analysis of gradient descent for this problem when the data is two-dimensional: we show that GD with a sufficiently large learning rate $\u03b7$ finds a point with loss smaller than $\\mathcal{O}(1/(\u03b7T))$, as long as $T \\geq \u03a9(n/\u03b3+ 1/\u03b3^2)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Our improved rate comes from a tighter bound on the time $\u03c4$ that it takes for GD to transition from unstable (non-monotonic loss) to stable (monotonic loss), via a fine-grained analysis of the oscillatory dynamics of GD in the subspace orthogonal to the max-margin classifier. We also provide a lower bound of $\u03c4$ matching our upper bound up to logarithmic factors, showing that our analysis is tight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u53ef\u5206\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u903b\u8f91\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u6700\u5927\u95f4\u9694\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u632f\u8361\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u6536\u7d27\u4e86\u8fc7\u6e21\u65f6\u95f4\u03c4\u7684\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53T \u2265 \u03a9(n/\u03b3 + 1/\u03b3\u00b2)\u65f6\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97O(1/(\u03b7T))\u7684\u8d85\u989d\u635f\u5931\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u03c4\u7684\u5339\u914d\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5206\u6790\u662f\u7d27\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5927\u6b65\u957f\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u5206\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u4e861/T\u00b2\u52a0\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u5145\u5206\u523b\u753b\u635f\u5931\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f4e\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fc7\u6e21\u8fc7\u7a0b\u03c4\u7684\u7d27\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u6700\u5927\u95f4\u9694\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u632f\u8361\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u671f\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u671f\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u65f6\u95f4\u03c4\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u635f\u5931\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "1) \u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570T \u2265 \u03a9(n/\u03b3 + 1/\u03b3\u00b2)\u65f6\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u4f4e\u4e8eO(1/(\u03b7T))\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff1b2) \u7ed9\u51fa\u03c4\u7684\u5339\u914d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff08\u4ec5\u5dee\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u632f\u8361\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u6536\u655b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u8fc7\u6e21\u65f6\u95f4\u03c4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u6b65\u957f\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

A wide variety of applications are currently being developed for scientific and technological purposes, however, most research relies on the use of highly entangled resource states that are challenging to generate and control in a given physical system. Here, we study the use of weighted graph states as more accessible resources for quantum metrology, which yield a favorable precision beyond the classical limit, approaching the Heisenberg limit. We find a notable robustness to variation in weights and less challenging weight requirements compared to standard graph states, which require a maximal weight at all edges. Both of these aspects reduce the practical demands in a physical setup, with the latter implying significantly less entanglement is required to gain a quantum advantage in metrology. We study the quantum Fisher information and optimized estimator variance of two identified sub classes of weighted graph states for an arbitrary number of N qubits, providing analytical forms and investigating their scaling.

While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbations--misleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) traces--cause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing model-specific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating a faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of accuracy-only evaluations and motivate training and assessment protocols that jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and the faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RL\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u51c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53ca\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u517c\u987e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6", "motivation": "\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u4ece\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RL\u8c03\u4f18\u540e\u7684VLM\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9 grounding \u5f31\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u7b49\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u6587\u672c\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u6807\u9898/\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u71b5\u503c\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7a76RL\u5fae\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565", "result": "1) \u6587\u672c\u6270\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u660e\u663e\n2) \u63ed\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f46\u635f\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u53ef\u9760\u6027\n3) \u5bf9\u6297\u589e\u5f3a\u65e0\u6cd5\u963b\u6b62\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u4f46\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u6377\u5f84\u7b56\u7565", "conclusion": "\u5355\u7eaf\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u8c03\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3VLM\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898"}}

To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite for MFGs (Bench-MFG), focusing on the discrete-time, discrete-space, stationary setting for the sake of clarity. We introduce a taxonomy of problem classes, ranging from no-interaction and monotone games to potential and dynamics-coupled games, and provide prototypical environments for each. Furthermore, we propose MF-Garnets, a method for generating random MFG instances to facilitate rigorous statistical testing. We benchmark a variety of learning algorithms across these environments, including a novel black-box approach (MF-PSO) for exploitability minimization.

The Welch bounds address this question, and are saturated by $k$-designs, i.e. sets of states reproducing the $k$-th Haar moments. However, these bounds quickly become uninformative when the number of states is below that required for an exact $k$-design. We derive strengthened Welch-type inequalities that remain sharp in this regime by exploiting rank constraints from partial transposition and spectral properties of the partially transposed Haar moment operator. We prove that the deviation from the Welch bound captures the average-case approximation error, hence characterizing a natural notion of minimum achievable error at fixed cardinality. For $k=3$, we prove that SICs and complete MUB sets saturate our bounds, making them optimal approximate 3-designs of their cardinality. This leads a natural variational criterion to rule out the existence of a complete set MUBs, which we use to obtain numerical evidence against such set in dimension $6$.

Shroff"], "title": "Constraint-Rectified Training for Efficient Chain-of-Thought", "comment": null, "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially when combined with reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training methods. While longer reasoning traces can improve answer quality and unlock abilities such as self-correction, they also incur high inference costs and often introduce redundant steps, known as overthinking. Recent research seeks to develop efficient reasoning strategies that balance reasoning length and accuracy, either through length-aware reward design or prompt-based calibration. However, these heuristic-based approaches may suffer from severe accuracy drop and be very sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these problems, we introduce CRT (Constraint-Rectified Training), a principled post-training framework based on reference-guarded constrained optimization, yielding a more stable and interpretable formulation for efficient reasoning. CRT alternates between minimizing reasoning length and rectifying accuracy only when performance falls below the reference, enabling stable and effective pruning of redundant reasoning. We further extend CRT with a two-stage training scheme that first discovers the shortest reliable reasoning patterns and then refines accuracy under a learnt length budget, preventing the re-emergence of verbose CoT. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that this framework consistently reduces token usage while maintaining answer quality at a robust and reliable level. Further analysis reveals that CRT improves reasoning efficiency not only by shortening responses but also by reducing internal language redundancy, leading to a new evaluation metric. Moreover, CRT-based training naturally yields a sequence of intermediate checkpoints that span a spectrum of explanation lengths while preserving correctness, enabling fine-grained control over reasoning verbosity without retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCRT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4fee\u6b63\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\"\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u5197\u4f59", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe(CoT)\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u4f46\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u4fee\u6b63\u8bad\u7ec3(CRT)\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u65f6\u4fee\u6b63\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b2) \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5148\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u77ed\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7cbe\u70bc\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "result": "1) \u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11token\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u7f29\u77ed\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u5197\u4f59\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff1b3) \u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u63a7\u5236", "conclusion": "CRT\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8be6\u7ec6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236"}}

A common assumption is that such channels admit a Markovian generator, namely a Pauli-Lindblad model with non-negative rates, but the validity of this assumption has not been systematically examined. Here, using CP-indivisibility as our criterion for non-Markovianity, we study multi-qubit Pauli channels from a single snapshot of the dynamics. We find that while the generator always has the same structure as the standard Pauli-Lindblad model, the rates may be negative or complex. We show that random Pauli channels are almost always non-Markovian, with the probability of encountering a negative rate converging doubly exponentially to unity with the number of qubits. For physically motivated noise models shaped by Pauli twirling, including single-qubit over-rotations and two-qubit amplitude damping errors, we find that negative rates are generic, even when the underlying physical noise is Markovian. We generalize probabilistic error amplification and cancellation to non-Markovian generators, and quantify the sampling overhead introduced by negative and complex rates. Experiments on superconducting qubits confirm that allowing negative rates in the learned noise model yields more accurate predictions than restricting to non-negative rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u6ce1\u5229\u4fe1\u9053\u5177\u6709\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6ce1\u5229-\u6797\u5fb7\u5e03\u62c9\u5fb7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901f\u7387\u53c2\u6570\u5e38\u4e3a\u8d1f\u503c\u6216\u590d\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u9053\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\u3002\u968f\u673a\u6ce1\u5229\u4fe1\u9053\u51e0\u4e4e\u603b\u662f\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u8d1f\u901f\u7387\u5728\u7269\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f88\u666e\u904d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5141\u8bb8\u8d1f\u901f\u7387\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u9650\u5236\u4e3a\u975e\u8d1f\u901f\u7387\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6ce1\u5229\u4fe1\u9053\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u5982\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u90a3\u6837\u5177\u6709\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u5177\u6709\u975e\u8d1f\u901f\u7387\u7684\u6ce1\u5229-\u6797\u5fb7\u5e03\u62c9\u5fb7\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u6027\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff08CP-indivisibility\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\u7684\u5224\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5feb\u7167\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6ce1\u5229\u4fe1\u9053\u3002", "result": "1) \u751f\u6210\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u540c\u6807\u51c6\u6ce1\u5229-\u6797\u5fb7\u5e03\u62c9\u5fb7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u901f\u7387\u53ef\u4e3a\u8d1f\u6216\u590d\u6570\uff1b2) \u968f\u673a\u6ce1\u5229\u4fe1\u9053\u51e0\u4e4e\u603b\u662f\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u8d1f\u901f\u7387\u6982\u7387\u968f\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u5448\u53cc\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e1\uff1b3) \u7269\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u8fc7\u65cb\u3001\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u632f\u5e45\u963b\u5c3c\uff09\u4e2d\u8d1f\u901f\u7387\u5f88\u666e\u904d\uff1b4) \u5c06\u6982\u7387\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u4e0e\u6d88\u9664\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b5) \u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8d1f\u901f\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ce1\u5229\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5047\u8bbe\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u8d1f\u901f\u7387\u662f\u666e\u904d\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5141\u8bb8\u8d1f\u901f\u7387\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bef\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Depending on the input, they may over-rely on linguistic priors relative to visual evidence, or conversely over-attend to visually salient but facts in textual contexts. Prior work has applied a uniform steering intensity to adjust the modality preference of MLLMs. However, strong steering can impair standard inference and increase error rates, whereas weak steering is often ineffective. In addition, because steering sensitivity varies substantially across multimodal instances, a single global strength is difficult to calibrate. To address this limitation with minimal disruption to inference, we introduce an instance-aware diagnostic metric that quantifies each modality's information contribution and reveals sample-specific susceptibility to steering. Building on these insights, we propose a scaling strategy that reduces steering for sensitive samples and a learnable module that infers scaling patterns, enabling instance-aware control of modality preference. Experimental results show that our instance-aware steering outperforms conventional steering in modulating modality preference, achieving effective adjustment while keeping generation error rates low.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7684 steering \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5b9a\u8c03\u6574\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u504f\u597d\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u8282\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\uff08\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u6216\u89c6\u89c9\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5747\u5300 steering \u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a steering \u635f\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5f31 steering \u65e0\u6548\u3001\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u5168\u5c40\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5b9a steering \u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u654f\u611f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7f29\u51cf\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7f29\u653e\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5 steering \u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u8282\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7 steering \u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Conventional FedAvg and many advanced methods can suffer from excessive drift and degraded convergence under these realistic constraints. This work introduces Fractional-Order Roughness-Informed Federated Averaging (FO-RI-FedAvg), a lightweight and modular extension of FedAvg that improves stability through two complementary client-side mechanisms: (i) adaptive roughness-informed proximal regularization, which dynamically tunes the pull toward the global model based on local loss-landscape roughness, and (ii) non-integer-order local optimization, which incorporates short-term memory to smooth conflicting update directions. The approach preserves standard FedAvg server aggregation, adds only element-wise operations with amortizable overhead, and allows independent toggling of each component. Experiments on two real-world BEV energy prediction datasets, VED and its extended version eVED, show that FO-RI-FedAvg achieves improved accuracy and more stable convergence compared to strong federated baselines, particularly under reduced client participation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFO-RI-FedAvg\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6570\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u65f6\u53d8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5de5\u51b5\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfFedAvg\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b64\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFO-RI-FedAvg\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u673a\u5236\uff1a1)\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8fd1\u7aef\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u62c9\u56de\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b2)\u975e\u6574\u6570\u9636\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e73\u6ed1\u51b2\u7a81\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u4fdd\u6301\u6807\u51c6FedAvg\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u644a\u9500\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ec4\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u5f00\u5173\u3002", "result": "\u5728VED\u548ceVED\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFO-RI-FedAvg\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We attribute this gap to a pre-routing bottleneck: multi-head attention concatenates head-specific signals into a single post-attention router input, forcing routing to act on co-occurring feature compositions rather than separable head channels. We show that this router input simultaneously encodes multiple separately decodable semantic and structural factors with uneven head support, and that different feature compositions induce weakly aligned parameter-gradient directions; as a result, routing maps many distinct compositions to the same route. We quantify this collision effect via a route-wise effective composition number $N_{eff}$ and find that higher $N_{eff}$ is associated with larger old-task loss increases after continual training. Motivated by these findings, we propose MH-MoE, which performs head-wise routing over sub-representations to increase routing granularity and reduce composition collisions.

While PAC-Bayes bounds (probably approximately correct) typically give bounds for the generalization error that hold with high probability, MAC-Bayes bounds have a similar form but bound the expected generalization error instead. The family of bounds we propose can be understood as a generalization of an expectation version of known PAC-Bayes bounds. Compared to standard PAC-Bayes bounds, the new bounds contain divergence terms that only depend on subsets (or \\emph{blocks}) of the training data. The proposed MAC-Bayes bounds hold the promise of significantly improving upon the tightness of traditional PAC-Bayes and MAC-Bayes bounds. This is illustrated with a simple numerical example in which the original PAC-Bayes bound is vacuous regardless of the choice of prior, while the proposed family of bounds are finite for appropriate choices of the block size. We also explore the question whether high-probability versions of our MAC-Bayes bounds (i.e., PAC-Bayes bounds of a similar form) are possible. We answer this question in the negative with an example that shows that in general, it is not possible to establish a PAC-Bayes bound which (a) vanishes with a rate faster than $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\log n)$ whenever the proposed MAC-Bayes bound vanishes with rate $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ and (b) exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the permitted error probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces novel block-sample MAC-Bayes bounds that improve generalization error estimation by using data subsets (\"blocks\"), offering tighter bounds than traditional PAC-Bayes methods, while proving inherent limitations in converting these to high-probability guarantees.", "motivation": "Traditional PAC-Bayes bounds often yield vacuous (infinite) results or lack tightness in expected generalization error estimation.

While this idea is well established, teachers trained with conventional cross-entropy often fail to preserve such signals. Their distributions collapse into sharp, overconfident peaks that appear decisive but are in fact brittle, offering little beyond the hard label or subtly hindering representation-level transfer. This overconfidence is especially problematic in high-cardinality tasks, where the nuances among many plausible classes matter most for guiding a compact student. Moreover, such brittle targets reduce robustness under distribution shift, leaving students vulnerable to miscalibration in real-world conditions. To address this limitation, we revisit distillation from a distributional perspective and propose Calibrated Uncertainty Distillation (CUD), a framework designed to make dark knowledge more faithfully accessible. Instead of uncritically adopting the teacher's overconfidence, CUD encourages teachers to reveal uncertainty where it is informative and guides students to learn from targets that are calibrated rather than sharpened certainty. By directly shaping the teacher's predictive distribution before transfer, our approach balances accuracy and calibration, allowing students to benefit from both confident signals on easy cases and structured uncertainty on hard ones.

While prior work focuses on training objectives or individual solvers, the holistic design of sampling, specifically solver selection and scheduling, remains dominated by static heuristics. In this work, we revisit this challenge through a geometric lens, proposing SDM, a principled framework that aligns the numerical solver with the intrinsic properties of the diffusion trajectory. By analyzing the ODE dynamics, we show that efficient low-order solvers suffice in early high-noise stages while higher-order solvers can be progressively deployed to handle the increasing non-linearity of later stages. Furthermore, we formalize the scheduling by introducing a Wasserstein-bounded optimization framework. This method systematically derives adaptive timesteps that explicitly bound the local discretization error, ensuring the sampling process remains faithful to the underlying continuous dynamics. Without requiring additional training or architectural modifications, SDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, including an FID of 1.93 on CIFAR-10, 2.41 on FFHQ, and 1.98 on AFHQv2, with a reduced number of function evaluations compared to existing samplers.

Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution.

Trajectory success rewards are suitable for human judges or model fitting, but the sparsity severely limits RL sample efficiency. While recent methods have effectively improved RL via dense rewards, they rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data or abundant expert supervision. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG), a novel framework to seek sample-efficient dense rewards without requiring human annotations or extensive supervision. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large video generation models, DEG only needs a small number of expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance for each RL episode. Then, the proposed dual-granularity reward that balances coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching, will guide the agent to efficiently approximate the generated guidance video sequentially in the contrastive self-supervised latent space, and finally complete the target task.

While effective at amplifying dominant behaviors, we identify a critical pathology in this alignment process: the systematic suppression of valid but rare (low-likelihood under the base model distribution) reasoning paths. We theoretically characterize this phenomenon as a \"Normalization Squeeze,\" where the interplay between mode-seeking policy gradients and finite sampling acts as a high-pass likelihood filter, driving the probability of rare correct traces to statistical extinction. To counteract this collapse without discarding the base model's latent diversity, we propose Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS). Unlike standard approaches that force internalization via parameter updates, ARTS prioritizes deliberation by decoupling generation from verification. We introduce a Flow Matching objective that repurposes the verifier to estimate the conservation of probability flow, enabling robust navigation through sparse, high-entropy search spaces where traditional discriminative objectives fail. Extensive experiments on the MATH-500 benchmark demonstrate that ARTS achieves a performance of 74.6% (BoN@16), effectively matching fully fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone.

Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences.

While recent work has shown that such updates can be transferred between models with identical architectures, transferring them across models of different widths remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Theseus, a training-free method for transporting task-specific updates across heterogeneous models. Rather than matching parameters directly, we characterize a task update by the functional effect it induces on intermediate representations.

However, many of these data are unlabeled, making it challenging to identify events, particularly anomalies. This task becomes even more formidable in nonstationary environments where model performance can deteriorate over time due to concept drift. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel method, VAE++ESDD, which employs incremental learning and two-level ensembling: an ensemble of Variational AutoEncoder(VAEs) for anomaly prediction, along with an ensemble of concept drift detectors. Each drift detector utilizes a statistical-based concept drift mechanism.

Existing adaptive methods require training auxiliary models. We propose Leverage-Weighted Conformal Prediction (LWCP), which weights nonconformity scores by a function of the statistical leverage -- the diagonal of the hat matrix -- deriving adaptivity from the geometry of the design matrix rather than from auxiliary model fitting. We prove that LWCP preserves finite-sample marginal validity for any weight function; achieves asymptotically optimal conditional coverage at essentially no width cost when heteroscedasticity factors through leverage; and recovers the form and width of classical prediction intervals under Gaussian assumptions while retaining distribution-free guarantees. We further establish that randomized leverage approximations preserve coverage exactly with controlled width perturbation, and that vanilla CP suffers a persistent, sample-size-independent conditional coverage gap that LWCP eliminates. The method requires no hyperparameters beyond the choice of weight function and adds negligible computational overhead to vanilla CP. Experiments on synthetic and real data confirm the theoretical predictions, demonstrating substantial reductions in conditional coverage disparity across settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6760\u6746\u52a0\u6743\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b(LWCP)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6760\u6746\u52a0\u6743\u975econformity\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u4f53\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u4ea7\u751f\u56fa\u5b9a\u5bbd\u5ea6\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u533a\u57df\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8986\u76d6\u800c\u5728\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u533a\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e3d\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u5143\u7d20(\u7edf\u8ba1\u6760\u6746)\u52a0\u6743\u975econformity\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u610f\u6743\u91cd\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u968f\u673a\u6760\u6746\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u6743\u91cd\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8fb9\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u901a\u8fc7\u6760\u6746\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\uff1b\u9ad8\u65af\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u7ecf\u5178\u533a\u95f4\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff1b\u968f\u673a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u8986\u76d6\u4e14\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u63a7\uff1b\u6d88\u9664\u666e\u901a\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u95f4\u9699\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "LWCP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often fall into the Pseudo-Equation Trap: producing equations that fit observations well but remain inconsistent with fundamental scientific principles. A key reason is that these approaches are dominated by empirical risk minimization, lacking explicit constraints to ensure scientific consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose PG-SR, a prior-guided SR framework built upon a three-stage pipeline consisting of warm-up, evolution, and refinement. Throughout the pipeline, PG-SR introduces a prior constraint checker that explicitly encodes domain priors as executable constraint programs, and employs a Prior Annealing Constrained Evaluation (PACE) mechanism during the evolution stage to progressively steer discovery toward scientifically consistent regions. Theoretically, we prove that PG-SR reduces the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space, yielding tighter generalization bounds and establishing a guarantee against pseudo-equations.

Sampling temperature directly controls the exploration--exploitation trade-off by modulating policy entropy, yet existing methods rely on static values or heuristic adaptations that are decoupled from task-level rewards. We propose Introspective LLM, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that learns to control sampling temperature during generation.

From a geometric perspective, the core difficulty lies in the topological intrusion of the majority class into the minority manifold, which obscures the true decision boundary. Traditional undersampling techniques, such as Edited Nearest Neighbours (ENN), typically employ symmetric cleaning rules and uniform voting, failing to capture the local manifold structure and often inadvertently removing informative minority samples. In this paper, we propose GMR (Geometric Manifold Rectification), a novel framework designed to robustly handle imbalanced structured data by exploiting local geometric priors. GMR makes two contributions: (1) Geometric confidence estimation that uses inverse-distance weighted kNN voting with an adaptive distance metric to capture local reliability; and (2) asymmetric cleaning that is strict on majority samples while conservatively protecting minority samples via a safe-guarding cap on minority removal.

This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it.

In contrast, self-supervised speech encoders such as WavLM provide strong acoustic representations yet remain opaque discriminative models with limited interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce ADEPT (Agentic Decoding of Emotion via Evidence Probing Tools), a framework that reframes emotion recognition as a multi-turn inquiry process rather than a single-pass prediction. ADEPT transforms an SLLM into an agent that maintains an evolving candidate emotion set and adaptively invokes dedicated semantic and acoustic probing tools within a structured pipeline of candidate generation, evidence collection, and adjudication. Crucially, ADEPT enables a paradigm shift from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven emotion reasoning. Since human affect exhibits inherent complexity and frequent co-occurrence of emotions, we treat minority annotations as informative perceptual signals rather than discarding them as noise. Finally, we integrate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an Evidence Trust Gate to explicitly couple tool-usage behaviors with prediction quality and enforce evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments show that ADEPT improves primary emotion accuracy in most settings while substantially improving minor emotion characterization, producing explanations grounded in auditable acoustic and semantic evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADEPT is an agentic framework that uses SLLMs with probing tools for emotion recognition, shifting from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven reasoning by treating minority emotions as signals, improving accuracy with auditable evidence.", "motivation": "SLLMs produce ungrounded, text-biased emotion judgments without acoustic evidence, while self-supervised speech encoders lack interpretability - creating a gap between high-level reasoning and verifiable acoustic representations.", "method": "ADEPT transforms SLLMs into agents that conduct multi-turn inquiry via candidate emotion sets and dedicated probing tools, integrating GRPO with an Evidence Trust Gate to enforce evidence-grounded reasoning.", "result": "The framework improves primary emotion accuracy and significantly enhances minor emotion characterization while providing explanations grounded in auditable acoustic and semantic evidence.", "conclusion": "ADEPT successfully bridges the interpretability gap in speech emotion recognition by enabling ambiguity-driven reasoning that treats co-occurring emotions as informative signals rather than noise."}}

While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques aim to make model decisions more transparent, their effectiveness is often hindered by the high dimensionality and noise present in raw time series data. In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations-using methods such as Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)-not only preserves but enhances explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on the most informative patterns. We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns.

The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al.

However, the classical SR is limited by its inherent policy dependence: policies change due to ongoing learning, environmental non-stationarities, and changes in task demands, making established predictive representations obsolete. Furthermore, in topologically complex environments, SRs suffer from spectral diffusion, leading to dense and overlapping features that scale poorly. Here we propose the Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) for overcoming these limitations. By incorporating temporal abstractions into the construction of predictive representations, HSR learns stable state features which are robust to task-induced policy changes. Applying non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to the HSR yields a sparse, low-rank state representation that facilitates highly sample-efficient transfer to novel tasks in multi-compartmental environments. Further analysis reveals that HSR-NMF discovers interpretable topological structures, providing a policy-agnostic hierarchical map that effectively bridges model-free optimality and model-based flexibility.

However, existing approaches typically employ a naive autoregressive generation strategy. We identify a critical theoretical flaw in this paradigm: during inference, the model operates in an open-loop manner, consuming its own generated outputs recursively. This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \\textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our closed-loop mechanism ensures uniformly bounded error, provided the base model satisfies a local Lipschitz constraint.

Recent federated variants of GC have targeted distributed infrastructure applications (e.g., smart grids) with distributed clients that generate high-dimensional data bound by data-sovereignty constraints. However, Federated GC algorithms only yield deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty. This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric (data noise) from epistemic (model variability) effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that explicitly characterizing uncertainty significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u8054\u90a6Granger\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u9012\u63a8\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u91cf\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u7a33\u6001\u65b9\u5dee\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6Granger\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff08\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u63cf\u8ff0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u9012\u63a8\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u7a33\u6001\u65b9\u5dee\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7a33\u6001\u65b9\u5dee\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u800c\u975e\u521d\u59cb\u8ba4\u77e5\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8054\u90a6Granger\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u7b49\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

This study evaluates whether functional MRI-derived regional homogeneity (ReHo) can be used to classify ACAM-J using machine-learning approaches. We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states.

This paper illustrates how to obtain probabilistic day-ahead forecasts of wind power generation via gradient boosting trees using an ensemble of weather forecasts. To this end, we perform a comparative analysis across three state-of-the-art probabilistic prediction methods-conformalised quantile regression, natural gradient boosting and conditional diffusion models-all of which can be combined with tree-based machine learning. The methods are validated using four years of data for all wind farms present within the Belgian offshore zone. Additionally, the point forecasts are benchmarked against deterministic engineering methods, using either the power curve or an advanced approach incorporating a calibrated analytical wake model. The experimental results show that the machine learning methods improve the mean absolute error by up to 53% and 33% compared to the power curve and the calibrated wake model. Considering the three probabilistic prediction methods, the conditional diffusion model is found to yield the best overall probabilistic and point estimate of wind power generation.

While lightweight architectures like MobileNet improve efficiency, they still demand thousands of parameters, limiting deployment on textile-integrated platforms. We introduce a convexified attention mechanism for wearable applications that dynamically weights features while preserving convexity through nonexpansive simplex projection and convex loss functions. Unlike conventional attention mechanisms using non-convex softmax operations, our approach employs Euclidean projection onto the probability simplex combined with multi-class hinge loss, ensuring global convergence guarantees. Implemented on a textile-based capacitive sensor with four connection points, our approach achieves 100.00\\% accuracy on tap gestures and 100.00\\% on swipe gestures -- consistent across 10-fold cross-validation and held-out test evaluation -- while requiring only 120--360 parameters, a 97\\% reduction compared to conventional approaches. With sub-millisecond inference times (290--296$\u03bc$s) and minimal storage requirements ($<$7KB), our method enables gesture interfaces directly within e-textiles without external processing. Our evaluation, conducted in controlled laboratory conditions with a single-user dataset, demonstrates feasibility for basic gesture interactions. Real-world deployment would require validation across multiple users, environmental conditions, and more complex gesture vocabularies.

However, the massive parameter scale and computational demands of LAIMs pose significant challenges for resource-limited embodied agents. To address this issue, we investigate quantization-aware collaborative inference (co-inference) for embodied AI systems. First, we develop a tractable approximation for quantization-induced inference distortion. Based on this approximation, we derive lower and upper bounds on the quantization rate-inference distortion function, characterizing its dependence on LAIM statistics, including the quantization bit-width. Next, we formulate a joint quantization bit-width and computation frequency design problem under delay and energy constraints, aiming to minimize the distortion upper bound while ensuring tightness through the corresponding lower bound. Extensive evaluations validate the proposed distortion approximation, the derived rate-distortion bounds, and the effectiveness of the proposed joint design.

These environments can include factors such as sensor drift, changing user behavior, device aging, and adversarial dynamics. Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems. We formalize the objectives of embedding-level attacks, examine persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, and develop a layered taxonomy tailored to IoT. Additionally, we compare vulnerabilities across various learning paradigms and evaluate defense strategies under IoT constraints, including limited memory, edge computing, and federated aggregation. Our findings indicate that while CCL is effective for enhancing adaptive IoT intelligence, it may also elevate long-lived representation-level threats if not adequately secured.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60(CCL)\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5229\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u91cd\u653e\u673a\u5236\u690d\u5165\u6301\u4e45\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u91cd\u653e\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u690d\u5165\u957f\u671f\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u90e8\u7f72\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u7ea7\u653b\u51fb\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u5206\u6790\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7279\u6709\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3001\u8de8\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u6bd4\u8f83\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3001\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5185\u5b58/\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97/\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u5408\u7b49\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0CCL\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u957f\u671f\u8868\u793a\u7ea7\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u690d\u5165\u6301\u4e45\u540e\u95e8\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u653e\u673a\u5236\u5f3a\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u7279\u5f81", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u62a4CCL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc"}}

In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that a balanced mixture of homogeneous and heterogeneous graph pre-training benefits downstream tasks and propose a unified multi-domain \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{P}re-training method across \\textbf{H}omogeneous and \\textbf{H}eterogeneous graphs ($\\mathbf{GPH^{2}}$). To address the lack of a unified encoder for homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, we propose a Unified Multi-View Graph Construction that simultaneously encodes both without explicit graph-type-specific designs. To cope with the increased cross-domain distribution discrepancies arising from mixed graphs, we introduce domain-specific expert encoding. Each expert is independently pre-trained on a single graph to capture domain-specific knowledge, thereby shielding the pre-training encoder from the adverse effects of cross-domain discrepancies. For downstream tasks, we further design a Task-oriented Expert Fusion Strategy that adaptively integrates multiple experts based on their discriminative strengths. Extensive experiments on mixed graphs demonstrate that $\\text{GPH}^{2}$ enables stable transfer across graph types and domains, significantly outperforming existing graph pre-training methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGPH\u00b2\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u540c\u8d28\u4e0e\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u6df7\u5408\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u540c\u8d28\u6216\u5f02\u6784\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650", "method": "1) \u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\uff1a\u65e0\u9700\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u540c\u65f6\u7f16\u7801\u4e24\u79cd\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2) \u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f16\u7801\uff1a\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u56fe\u4e13\u5bb6\u6355\u83b7\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b3) \u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u4e13\u5bb6\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u5224\u522b\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7279\u5f81", "result": "\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u56fe\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u8d28\u4e0e\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u9694\u79bb\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

However, existing frameworks like R-Zero often exhibit non-sustained improvement, where early gains degrade as self-play continues. We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions. Across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods.

We address this gap with a key insight: atom ordering in neural representations matters. Building on this insight, we propose a structure-aware template-free framework that encodes the two-stage nature of chemical reactions as a positional inductive bias. By placing reaction center atoms at the sequence head, our method transforms implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns that the model can readily capture. The proposed RetroDiT backbone, a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings, exploits this ordering to prioritize chemically critical regions. Combined with discrete flow matching, our approach decouples training from sampling and enables generation in 20--50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both USPTO-50k (61.2% top-1) and the large-scale USPTO-Full (51.3% top-1) with predicted reaction centers. With oracle centers, performance reaches 71.1% and 63.4% respectively, surpassing foundation models trained on 10 billion reactions while using orders of magnitude less data.

However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e3b\u6a21\u578b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u96c6\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4f7f4-bit\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u53477.93\u5206\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u51cf\u5c1119.82\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u540e\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\uff08PTQ\uff09\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7684\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4f1a\u63a9\u76d6\u6216\u64e6\u9664\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u5230\u9057\u5fd8\u524d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u57284-bit\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u66f4\u65b0\u91cf\u8fc7\u5c0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\uff1a\u51bb\u7ed3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u6709\u6548\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u5f97\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama-2-7B\u548cMUSE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08BOOKS/NEWS\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cLoRA\u5c064-bit\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u7528\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad87.93\u70b9\uff08BOOKS: 50.17\u219258.10\uff09\uff0cNEWS\u63d0\u53474.76\u70b9\uff0840.06\u219244.82\uff09\uff1b\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u6307\u6807PrivLeak\u4ece-25.68\u6539\u5584\u81f3-5.86\uff08\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\u503c0\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\uff08VerMem\u548cKnowMem\u63a5\u8fd10\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u5728\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}
