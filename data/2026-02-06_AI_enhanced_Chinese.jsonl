Traditional parametric approaches can be trained to generate integer-count predictions but may struggle with capturing complex, non-linear dependencies often observed in the data. Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a robust non-parametric alternative to modeling continuous data; however, it cannot generate integer outputs. We propose the Poisson Log-Normal (PoLoN) process, a framework that employs GP to model Poisson log-rates. As in GP regression, our approach relies on the correlations between data points captured via GP kernel structure rather than explicit functional parameterizations. We demonstrate that the PoLoN predictive distribution is Poisson-LogNormal and provide an algorithm for optimizing kernel hyperparameters. Furthermore, we adapt the PoLoN approach to the problem of detecting weak localized signals superimposed on a smoothly varying background - a task of considerable interest in many areas of science and engineering. Our framework allows us to predict the strength, location and width of the detected signals. We evaluate PoLoN's performance using both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the open dataset from CERN which was used to detect the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider. Our results indicate that the PoLoN process can be used as a non-parametric alternative for analyzing, predicting, and extracting signals from integer-valued data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPoisson Log-Normal (PoLoN)\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u6574\u6570\u8ba1\u6570\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u5fae\u5f31\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8ba1\u6570\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u867d\u7a33\u5065\u4f46\u53ea\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u79bb\u6563\u975e\u8d1f\u7684\u6574\u6570\u8ba1\u6570\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u6784\u5efaPoLoN\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u6cca\u677e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u6355\u83b7\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u4e3aPoisson-LogNormal\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6838\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u80cc\u666f\u4e0a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5fae\u5f31\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ecCERN\u5e0c\u683c\u65af\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u63a2\u6d4b\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6", "conclusion": "PoLoN\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4ece\u6574\u6570\u503c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6709\u6548\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

Extending a previously studied heterogeneous Markov ensemble, we incorporate correlations between forward and backward transition rates through a single asymmetry parameter $\u03b3$, while heterogeneity is controlled by $\u03b5$. Using results from random matrix theory, we identify a critical locus $\u03b5_c(\u03b3,N)$ at which relaxation times diverge and spectral universality breaks down. We characterize the behavior of entropy production, predictive information, and relaxation dynamics across the ensemble, showing that many observables depend strongly on heterogeneity but only weakly on asymmetry, except near the symmetric limit. Applying maximum-likelihood inference to human fMRI and EEG data, we find that both modalities operate near the predicted critical locus and occupy a similar region of the $\u03b5-\u03b3$ plane, supporting a super-universality of human brain dynamics. While ensemble averages are well captured by the null model, empirical data exhibit substantially enhanced variability, indicating subject-specific structure beyond random expectations.

This implies a non-perturbative stability criterion: a fixed point with smaller CMI cannot be destabilized toward one with larger CMI. Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry.

AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which \"general intelligence\" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence.

Most neuroimaging pipelines fit one model per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards multivariate dependence that may encode coordinated patterns. We propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as a unified conditional density estimator for tabular IDPs, from which univariate centiles and deviation scores are derived by sampling. We utilise two denoiser backbones: (i) a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned multilayer perceptron (MLP) and (ii) a tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention (SAINT), conditioning covariates through learned embeddings. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark with heteroscedastic and multimodal age effects and on UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes, scaling from dimension of 2 to 200. Our evaluation suite includes centile calibration (absolute centile error, empirical coverage, and the probability integral transform), distributional fidelity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), multivariate dependence diagnostics, and nearest-neighbour memorisation analysis. For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure.

We analytically demonstrate that this relationship holds universally across glassy systems with varying dimensions and distinct interaction types. This robust theoretical relationship motivates the adoption of linear machine learning models, which we show numerically to achieve surprisingly high predictive accuracy for structure-property mapping in a wide variety of glassy materials.

By tuning the potential difference between the legs, we explore the regime of intermediate layer polarization $P$. Combining density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with bosonization analysis, we identify a spin-gapped phase at finite $P$, where the interlayer and intralayer pair correlations both oscillate, but with distinct periodicities. The interlayer correlations exhibit FFLO-like oscillations, driven by pairing between layers with mismatched Fermi momenta, with a period determined by their momentum difference. In contrast, the intralayer pair correlations arise from the coupling between charges on one layer and spin fluctuations on the opposite layer, with a momentum equal to twice the Fermi momentum of the opposite layer. The iC-PDW state is robust across a wide range of doping and polarization, although finite interlayer hopping eventually destabilizes it toward a state with charge-$4e$ correlations. We conclude by discussing the experimental realization of this model in optical lattice platforms and its relevance to the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d1\u73b0\u53cc\u68aft-J-J\u22a5\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5468\u671f\u5bf9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2(iC-PDW)\u5173\u8054\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49Luther-Emery\u6db2\u76f8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u68af\u95f4\u52bf\u80fd\u548c\u6781\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DMRG\u548c\u73bb\u8272\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6781\u5316\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u81ea\u65cb\u80fd\u9699\u76f8\uff0c\u5176\u5c42\u95f4\u548c\u5c42\u5185\u914d\u5bf9\u5173\u8054\u5206\u522b\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u8be5\u6001\u5728\u8f83\u5bbd\u53c2\u91cf\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u954d\u9178\u76d0\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u5947\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u68af\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u53cc\u5c42\u954d\u9178\u76d0La\u2083Ni\u2082O\u2087\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u76f8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u5c42\u95f4\u8026\u5408\u548c\u6781\u5316\u8c03\u63a7\u4e0b\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4(DMRG)\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u73bb\u8272\u5316\u89e3\u6790\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u95f4\u8dc3\u8fc1\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4e24\u6761t-J-J\u22a5\u68af\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u4e24\u68af\u95f4\u7684\u52bf\u80fd\u5dee\u6765\u8c03\u63a7\u5c42\u6781\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6P\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u5c42\u6781\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u65cb\u80fd\u9699\u6253\u5f00\u7684\u65b0\u7269\u76f8\uff0c\u5176\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c42\u95f4\u548c\u5c42\u5185\u7684\u632f\u8361\u914d\u5bf9\u5173\u8054\uff1a\u5c42\u95f4\u5173\u8054\u5448\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3cFFLO\u7684\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5468\u671f\u7531\u4e24\u68af\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u5931\u914d\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b\u5c42\u5185\u5173\u8054\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e00\u68af\u7535\u8377\u4e0e\u53e6\u4e00\u68af\u81ea\u65cb\u6da8\u843d\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u52a8\u91cf\u7b49\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4fa7\u68af\u8d39\u7c73\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u4e24\u500d\u3002\u8be5iC-PDW\u76f8\u5bf9\u63ba\u6742\u548c\u6781\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u88ab\u5f3a\u5c42\u95f4\u8dc3\u8fc1\u7834\u574f\u800c\u8f6c\u54114e\u7535\u8377\u5173\u8054\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5e7f\u4e49Luther-Emery\u6db2\u76f8\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u6001\uff0c\u5176\u975e\u5468\u671f\u5bf9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5c42\u72b6\u8d85\u5bfc\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5728\u5149\u5b66\u683c\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u53cc\u5c42\u954d\u9178\u76d0La\u2083Ni\u2082O\u2087\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u73b0\u8c61\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

This phenomenon can be modeled as a queuing process whose arrival distribution is determined by a search process with stochastic resetting. When the queuing system has a limited number of servers and the search process occurs within a bounded domain, the dynamics of expediting or delaying the search through stochastic resetting interact with the long-term dynamics of the number of resources in the queue. We combine results from queuing theory with those from search processes with stochastic resetting in a bounded domain to obtain regions of the parameter space of the search process that ensure convergence of the number of resources in the queue to a steady state. Furthermore, we find a threshold resetting rate at which the effects of stochastic resetting shift from reducing convergence regions to expanding them. Finally, we demonstrate that this threshold value grows exponentially with the number of servers, making it harder for stochastic resetting to improve the convergence of the queueing system.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper combines queuing theory and stochastic resetting search processes in bounded domains to identify parameter regions ensuring queue convergence, revealing a threshold resetting rate that shifts from reducing to expanding convergence regions, with this threshold growing exponentially with server count.", "motivation": "To address resource management challenges where arrival/consumption are environmentally random, requiring understanding of how stochastic resetting in bounded search domains affects queue stability in systems with limited servers.", "method": "Integrates queuing theory with stochastic resetting search models in bounded domains to analyze interactions between search dynamics (expedited/delayed by resetting) and long-term queue resource dynamics.", "result": "Identifies parameter regions for queue steady-state convergence; discovers a critical resetting rate threshold where resetting effects reverse from shrinking to expanding convergence regions, with threshold value growing exponentially as servers increase.", "conclusion": "Stochastic resetting's ability to improve queue convergence becomes increasingly constrained in larger systems due to exponentially growing threshold requirements, limiting its practical effectiveness for multi-server queue optimization."}}

Maximizing the quantum Fisher information is essential for achieving the optimal estimation precision of quantum sensors. A typical quantum sensor involves a qubit(e.g. a spin-1/2) probe undergoing an unknown rotation, here the unknown rotation angle is the parameter to be estimated. A well known limitation is that if the rotation axis is unknown, the maximal quantum Fisher information is impossible to attain. This limitation has been lifted recently by leveraging entanglement between the probe qubit and an ancilla qubit. Namely, through measurement of the ancilla after the axis is revealed, one can prepare the probe that is optimal for any unknown rotation axis. This proposal, however, works only for a spin-1/2. Considering large spin probes can achieve a larger quantum Fisher information, offering enhanced metrological advantage, we here utilize the entanglement between a large spin probe and an ancilla to achieve optimal quantum Fisher information for estimating the rotation angle, without prior knowledge of the rotation axis. Different from the previous spin-1/2 case, achieving the optimal precision with large spins generally requires post-selection, resulting in a success probability dependent on the dimension of the Hilbert space. Furthermore, we extend the encoding state from the maximally entangled case to general entangled states, showing that optimal metrology can still be achieved with a certain success probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing studies predominantly analyze jailbreak prompts by probing latent representations, often overlooking the causal relationships between interpretable prompt features and jailbreak occurrences. In this work, we propose Causal Analyst, a framework that integrates LLMs into data-driven causal discovery to identify the direct causes of jailbreaks and leverage them for both attack and defense. We introduce a comprehensive dataset comprising 35k jailbreak attempts across seven LLMs, systematically constructed from 100 attack templates and 50 harmful queries, annotated with 37 meticulously designed human-readable prompt features. By jointly training LLM-based prompt encoding and GNN-based causal graph learning, we reconstruct causal pathways linking prompt features to jailbreak responses. Our analysis reveals that specific features, such as \"Positive Character\" and \"Number of Task Steps\", act as direct causal drivers of jailbreaks. We demonstrate the practical utility of these insights through two applications: (1) a Jailbreaking Enhancer that targets identified causal features to significantly boost attack success rates on public benchmarks, and (2) a Guardrail Advisor that utilizes the learned causal graph to extract true malicious intent from obfuscated queries. Extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons and causal structure validation, confirm the robustness of our causal analysis and its superiority over non-causal approaches.

By performing the quenched-disorder average at the level of the effective action, we derive exact quadratic and interaction terms. In the weak-disorder limit, we show that the infrared structure of the two-point correlation functions yields a decomposition of the physical field into correlated components with distinct scaling dimensions. This mechanism exhibits the characteristic $1/p^4$ behavior, which shifts the upper critical dimension to $d_c^{+}=6$. The universal critical behavior of the RFIM near this dimension is governed by a minimal infrared effective action.

Critical exponents define these classes, with the Ising model being the outstanding prototype that elucidates the differences from the mean-field category, believed to be valid above a critical dimension only. Here, in apparent striking contradiction to the Ising universality class, we demonstrate that the critical behavior of a finite Ising system of $N$ spins in $d = 3$ obeys mean-field Landau theory in the vicinity of its critical point, with classical critical exponents. Yet, when expressed in terms of the linear size $L$ of the system, the free energy unveils its proper finite-size scaling form, from which the thermodynamic limit critical temperature $T_c$ and the Ising critical exponents $\u03bd$, $\u03b3$ and $\u03b2$ can be identified. We find that the larger the size $L$, the smaller the mean-field region, shrinking to zero in the thermodynamic limit. These conclusions are achieved via the use of an alternative approach to collect data from a Monte Carlo simulation of a three-dimensional Ising model that allows for the evaluation of the free energy per spin $f = f(T,m;L)$ and of the coexistence curve, or spontaneous magnetization at zero magnetic field, $m_{\\rm coex} = m(T;L)$ as functions of temperature $T$ and magnetization per spin $m = M/N$.

Given an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state $\u03c1$ and a known set of observables $\\{O_i\\}_{i=1}^m$, the goal is to estimate expectation values $\\{\\mathrm{tr}(O_i\u03c1)\\}_{i=1}^m$ to accuracy $\u03b5$ in $L_p$-norm, using possibly adaptive measurements that act on $O(\\mathrm{polylog}(d))$ number of copies of $\u03c1$ at a time. We focus on the regime where $\u03b5$ is below an instance-dependent threshold.\n  Our main contribution is an instance-optimal characterization of the sample complexity as $\\tilde\u0398(\u0393_p/\u03b5^2)$, where $\u0393_p$ is a function of $\\{O_i\\}_{i=1}^m$ defined via an optimization formula involving the inverse Fisher information matrix. Previously, tight bounds were known only in special cases, e.g. Pauli shadow tomography with $L_\\infty$-norm error. Concretely, we first analyze a simpler oblivious variant where the goal is to estimate an observable of the form $\\sum_{i=1}^m \u03b1_i O_i$ with $\\|\u03b1\\|_q = 1$ (where $q$ is dual to $p$) revealed after the measurement. For single-copy measurements, we obtain a sample complexity of $\u0398(\u0393^{\\mathrm{ob}}_p/\u03b5^2)$.

Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMINT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6811\u63a8\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\u5e76\u4f18\u5316AI\u4e3b\u52a8\u63d0\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5c", "motivation": "\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u7b49\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u9700AI\u4e3b\u52a8\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\u83b7\u53d6\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f93\u5165\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u4f5c\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u679c", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u7b26\u53f7\u6811\u679a\u4e3e\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u547d\u9898\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u4f30\u8ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b3) \u7ed3\u5408LLM\u641c\u7d22\u4f18\u5316MINT\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u63d0\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\uff1b4) \u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5316AI\u4e3b\u52a8 elicitation \u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u5bf9\u8c61\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9012\u589e\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMINT\u4ec5\u9700\u6bcf\u4efb\u52a1\u5c11\u91cf\u63d0\u95ee\u5373\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u503c\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e3b\u52a8\u63d0\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6848"}}

To date, tensor networks have been an essential tool for studying such quantum systems, owing to their ability to efficiently capture the entanglement properties of the systems they represent. One of the well-known tensor network architectures, namely matrix product states (MPS), is the standard method for simulating one-dimensional QMBS. Here, we propose a simple, yet efficient, method to augment the already available MPS algorithms to simulate the dynamics of time-dependent Hamiltonians with better accuracy and a faster convergence rate, giving a second-order convergence compared to the first-order convergence of the standard method. We apply our proposed method to simulate the dynamics of a chain of single spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamonds, which has potential applications for practical and scalable quantum technologies, and find that our method improves the average error for a system of few NV centers by a factor of about 1000 for moderate step sizes.

As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.\n  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.\n  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u516b\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u5b66\u63a2\u7a76\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u56fe\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u80fd\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u672a\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u6d1e\u89c1\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u5e94\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u63a2\u7d22\u800c\u975e\u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u5b66\u751f\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u56fe\u8bba\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u652f\u6301\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u516b\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u68c0\u9a8cLLM\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u7ebf\u56fe\u4f18\u7f8e\u6027\u7684\u5df2\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u662f\u5c1a\u65e0\u89e3\u6cd5\u7684\u672a\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u5305\u62ec\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u6784\u5efa\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u5b66\u63a2\u7a76\u8981\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5df2\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6b63\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u56de\u5fc6\u7ed3\u679c\u4e14\u65e0\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7ecf\u4e13\u5bb6\u786e\u8ba4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u5728\u672a\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u4ea7\u751f\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u5408\u7406\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u63a8\u8fdb\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ec5\u627f\u8ba4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u672a\u865a\u6784\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u65e2\u5b9a\u6750\u6599\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u9896\u6570\u5b66\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u6216\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u751f\u5c06LLM\u7528\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6b63\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u5219\u4f9d\u8d56\u72ec\u7acb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4e25\u8c28\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, its practical effectiveness in real-world applications remains poorly understood, particularly regarding potential trade-offs with output quality. We show that feature steering methods substantially degrade model performance even when successfully controlling target behaviors, a critical trade-off. Specifically, we evaluate Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries (covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors) on 171 Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control. Our findings show that Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (achieving scores of 3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B and 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B), but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy on the MMLU questions drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively. Simple prompting achieves the best overall balance. These findings highlight limitations of current feature steering methods for practical deployment where task performance cannot be sacrificed.

We present large-scale numerical simulations of a trapped-ion native MIPT, argued to belong to the universality class described by the Haar non-unitary conformal field theory. First, through a finite-size analysis we obtained the critical measurement rate, and correlation length exponent, which falls close to the percolation value. Second, by leveraging a monotone computable via semi-definite programming, we uncover robust algebraic decay of genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) versus separation for 2, 3, and 4 parties. The corresponding critical exponents are lower-bounded by those of the multiparty mutual information, which we determine up to 4 parties, and conjecture to be (k+2) for k parties. Additionally, we derive lower bounds for both GME and multiparty mutual information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u56da\u7981\u79bb\u5b50\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u53d8\u5c5e\u4e8eHaar\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\u666e\u9002\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e34\u754c\u6307\u6570\u63a5\u8fd1\u6e17\u6d41\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u4ee3\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5176\u6807\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u63a8\u6d4b\u4e3a(k+2)\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u53d8\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u56da\u7981\u79bb\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u9002\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7269\u8d28\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u56da\u7981\u79bb\u5b50\u539f\u751f\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u53d8\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6807\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u4e34\u754c\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u534a\u5b9a\u7f16\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6e17\u6d41\u503c\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7387\u548c\u5173\u8054\u957f\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\uff1b\u53d1\u73b02-4\u4f53\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u5bf9\u5206\u79bb\u5448\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e34\u754c\u6307\u6570\u88ab\u591a\u4f53\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6307\u6570\u4e0b\u754c\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u63a8\u6d4bk\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u6307\u6570\u4e3a(k+2)\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56da\u7981\u79bb\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u53d8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Haar\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\u666e\u9002\u7c7b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u591a\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u6807\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Developing efficient methods for their generation remains a central challenge in spintronics. Here, we investigate spin current generation via two-dimensional topological spin textures: a skyrmion crystal (SkX) with out-of-plane magnetization, a bimeron crystal (BmX) with in-plane magnetization, and a meron crystal (MX) with zero net magnetization. We show that these distinct spin textures generate spin currents with characteristic spin polarization directions. In the absence of spin--orbit coupling, the SkX and BmX generate spin currents polarized along their magnetization directions, whereas the MX yields no spin current. Upon introducing spin--orbit coupling, while the behavior of the SkX does not qualitatively change, the BmX generates nonzero spin currents in multiple polarization directions. Notably, the MX, despite its zero net magnetization, exhibits a pronounced spin current with out-of-plane spin polarization, driven by an enhanced spin Berry curvature associated with characteristic band degeneracy. We further demonstrate that the electronic and spin transport properties of each texture are governed by their magnetic symmetries. Our results highlight the topological spin textures as efficient sources of spin current even without net magnetization, expanding the design for spintronics devices based on topological magnetic metals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u7ef4\u62d3\u6251\u81ea\u65cb\u7eb9\u7406\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u65cb\u6d41\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65af\u683c\u660e\u5b50\u3001\u53cc\u5b50\u548c\u534a\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6d41\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u96f6\u51c0\u78c1\u5316\u7684\u534a\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u5728\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u81ea\u65cb\u6d41\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u5668\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u65cb\u6d41\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u662f\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u62d3\u6251\u81ea\u65cb\u7eb9\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u6d41\u6e90\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u79cd\u4e8c\u7ef4\u62d3\u6251\u81ea\u65cb\u7eb9\u7406\uff08\u65af\u683c\u660e\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u3001\u53cc\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u3001\u534a\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\uff09\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u8026\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6d41\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u8f93\u8fd0\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u8026\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u65af\u683c\u660e\u5b50\u548c\u53cc\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u6cbf\u78c1\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u6781\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6d41\uff0c\u800c\u534a\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u4e0d\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u65cb\u6d41\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u8026\u5408\u540e\uff0c\u534a\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9762\u5916\u6781\u5316\u81ea\u65cb\u6d41\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u81ea\u65cbBerry\u66f2\u7387\uff1b\u5404\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u6027\u8d28\u7531\u5176\u78c1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62d3\u6251\u81ea\u65cb\u7eb9\u7406\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u65cb\u6d41\u6e90\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u96f6\u51c0\u78c1\u5316\u7684\u534a\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u4e5f\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u81ea\u65cb\u6d41\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u78c1\u6027\u91d1\u5c5e\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u5668\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Upon entering the spin density wave state below 153 K, the $A_{1g}$ channel exhibits an abrupt electronic spectral gap with a clear isosbestic point. In contrast, the $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ channels are dominated by pronounced two-magnon (2M) excitations, representing an unambiguous signature of incipient Mottness. These 2M signals in both channels constitute direct evidence for two distinct in-plane spin exchange interactions along the Ni-O bonding and its diagonal directions. Calculations based on the spin wave theory further reveal that the 2M mode in the $B_{2g}$ channel arises from the competition between two bond-diagonal antiferromagnetic interactions mediated by nickel $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Furthermore, emergent low-energy 2M excitations below 10 meV are found to originate from distinct, weaker spin moments, strongly supporting spin disproportionation. Simultaneously, an anomalous softening of $B_{1g}$ phonons from 280 down to 4.5 K is uncovered, suggesting the presence of an incipient lattice instability leading to checkerboard-type breathing modulations.

The movement of the particles is guided by the local shape of the landscape, and this shape is also affected by the presence of different particle species. When a particle species push the landscape in the same (opposite) direction of its own motion, it is called an aligned (a reverse) bias. Aligned bias promotes ordering while reverse bias destroys it. In absence of vacancies, the system reduces to previously studied LH model with different kinds of ordered and disordered phases which could be explained as a competition or cooperation between aligned bias and reverse bias. This interplay is expected to remain unaffected even when vacancies are present since vacancies do not impart any kind of bias on the landscape. However, we find presence of vacancies effectively weakens the reverse bias and this significantly changes the outcome of the competition between the two bias types. As a result novel ordered phases emerge which were not seen before. We analytically calculate the new phase boundaries within mean field approximation. We show even when aligned bias is weaker than reverse bias, it is possible to find long range order in the system. We discover two new phases where particle species showing weak aligned bias phase separate and the other species with strong reverse bias stays mixed with the vacancies. We call these phases finite current with partial phase separation (FPPS) and vacancy induced phase separation (VIPS).

In parallel, physics-based models such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide mechanistic structure for many dynamical processes. Integrating these paradigms potentially allows physical knowledge to act as an inductive bias, improving identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems. However, such integration remains challenging: real dynamical systems often exhibit feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary data trend, while many widely used causal discovery methods are formulated under acyclicity or equilibrium-based assumptions. In this work, we propose an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that leverages partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias. Specifically, we model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term corresponds to unknown causal couplings beyond the prescribed physics. We develop a scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation. Under mild conditions, we establish guarantees to recover the causal graph.

We benchmark the method for bulk and layered SrVO$_3$ in equilibrium and apply it to a prototypical nonequilibrium geometry in which a voltage bias is applied perpendicular to the layer via reservoirs held at different chemical potentials. For bulk SrVO$_3$, MCA reproduces the metallic state at moderate interaction strengths, but it overestimates the weight of the lower band relative to quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and fork tensor product state (FTPS) solvers. With respect to QMC and FTPS, MCA yields an earlier metal-to-insulator transition as the electron-electron interaction is increased. In layered SrVO$_3$ at equilibrium, MCA partially captures the orbital polarization in favor of the in-plane $xy$ orbital, although not as strong as in the DMFT-converged results obtained with QMC. However, when performing a one-shot impurity calculation initialized with the DFMT-QMC results, MCA yields orbital occupations which show a stronger charge polarization in favor of orbital $xy$. This suggests that our approach can be used to study multiorbital impurity problems when the focus is to assess properties without performing the full DMFT self-consistent loop. Finally, under applied bias, we observe a pronounced redistribution of orbital occupations, demonstrating that the method captures bias-driven orbital charge transfer in realistic materials in nonequilibrium conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u7ec4\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c(MCA)\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u8f68\u9053\u5173\u8054\u7cfb\u7edfDMFT\u6742\u8d28\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5SrVO\u2083\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4QMC/FTPS\u80fd\u66f4\u65e9\u9884\u6d4b\u91d1\u5c5e-\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u504f\u538b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u7535\u8377\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u8f68\u9053\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6742\u8d28\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002\u4f20\u7edfQMC\u548cFTPS\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0cMCA\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7ec4\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c(MCA)\u6742\u8d28\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165DMFT\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5728SrVO\u2083\u5757\u6750\u548c\u5c42\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u5782\u76f4\u4e8e\u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u504f\u538b\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5757\u6750SrVO\u2083\uff1aMCA\u5728\u4e2d\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u4e0b\u91cd\u73b0\u91d1\u5c5e\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u4f30\u4f4e\u80fd\u5e26\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u6bd4QMC/FTPS\u66f4\u65e9\u51fa\u73b0\u91d1\u5c5e-\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u5c42\u72b6SrVO\u2083\uff1a\u90e8\u5206\u6355\u83b7xy\u8f68\u9053\u6781\u5316\uff0c\u82e5\u7528DMFT-QMC\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5219\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u5f3a\u7535\u8377\u6781\u5316\u3002\u504f\u538b\u4e0b\uff1a\u6210\u529f\u6355\u83b7\u8f68\u9053\u7535\u8377\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "MCA\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8f68\u9053\u6742\u8d28\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574DMFT\u81ea\u6d3d\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u63cf\u8ff0\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u504f\u538b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u7535\u8377\u8f6c\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time.

We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "TPC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u76f8\u540c\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u901f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff09\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u5e73\u6ed1\u60e9\u7f5a\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6216\u4fee\u6539\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08TPC\uff09\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5c42\u9762\u8026\u5408\u76f8\u540c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u914d\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e8c\u6b21\u8f68\u8ff9\u8026\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u6216\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cImageNet\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTPC\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684FID\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u53bb\u566a\u548crectified flow\u7b49\u73b0\u4ee3SOTA\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "TPC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

Focusing on the half-filled case, where the equilibrium ground state exhibits commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) order for any nonzero coupling, we identify three distinct post-quench dynamical regimes as a function of the final electron-phonon coupling: a nonequilibrium metallic state without CDW order, an intermediate regime characterized by slow scale-invariant ordering dynamics, and a frozen CDW state with arrested coarsening and immobile kinks. We analyze the intermediate regime in detail and uncover an unconventional algebraic decay of the kink density, $n \\sim t^{-1/3}$, distinct from both ballistic annihilation and diffusive coarsening in classical dissipative systems. We show that this anomalous exponent arises from the hybrid nature of the dynamics: while the lattice evolves deterministically, the electronic degrees of freedom act as an effective internal bath that induces diffusive kink motion without energy dissipation.

Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "GAPO replaces fixed reference policies in LLM alignment with a dynamic geometric anchor (adversarial perturbation of current policy), enabling adaptive preference reweighting that improves robustness against noise while maintaining performance.", "motivation": "Existing methods like DPO suffer from distributional mismatch when fixed reference policies become miscalibrated during training drift, amplifying noise in supervision.

The essential low-energy electronic structure of Dirac quadrupole altermagnets can be understood from a gapless parent phase (i.e., the Dirac quadrupole semimetal), which has important implications for their response to external fields. Focusing on the strain-induced response, here we demonstrate that the topological piezomagnetic effect is a consequence of the way in which strain affects the Dirac points forming a quadrupole.

They provide a powerful means to analyze the statistical properties of a system and find applications in diverse fields, including statistical physics and field theory. While these functions are ubiquitous in classical theory, a quantum counterpart has remained elusive due to the fundamental hurdle of noncommutativity of operators. The lack of such a framework has obscured the deep connections between standard statistical measures and the non-classical features of quantum mechanics. Here, we establish a comprehensive framework for quantum statistical functions that transcends these limitations, naturally unifying the disparate languages of standard quantum statistics, quasiprobability distributions, and weak values. We show that these functions, defined as expectation values with respect to the purified state, naturally reproduce fundamental quantum statistical quantities like expectation values, variance, and covariance upon differentiation. Crucially, by extending this framework to include the concepts of pre- and post-selection, we define conditional quantum statistical functions that uniquely yield weak values and weak variance. We further demonstrate that multivariable quantum statistical functions, when defined with specific operator orderings, correspond to well-known quasiprobability distributions. Our framework provides a cohesive mathematical structure that not only reproduces standard quantum statistical measures but also incorporates nonclassical features of quantum mechanics, thus laying the foundation for a deeper understanding of quantum statistics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u5316\u6001\u671f\u671b\u503c\u5b9a\u4e49\u89e3\u51b3\u7b97\u7b26\u975e\u5bf9\u6613\u6027\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5f31\u503c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u7edf\u8ba1\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u77e9\u751f\u6210\u51fd\u6570\uff09\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\uff0c\u56e0\u7b97\u7b26\u975e\u5bf9\u6613\u6027\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\u672a\u88ab\u63ed\u793a", "method": "\u4ee5\u7eaf\u5316\u6001\u671f\u671b\u503c\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u51fd\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u5206\u590d\u73b0\u671f\u671b\u503c/\u65b9\u5dee\u7b49\u57fa\u7840\u91cf\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u9009-\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u6761\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u7b97\u7b26\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6269\u5c55", "result": "1) \u5fae\u5206\u64cd\u4f5c\u81ea\u7136\u5bfc\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf 2) \u6761\u4ef6\u51fd\u6570\u552f\u4e00\u4ea7\u751f\u5f31\u503c\u53ca\u5f31\u65b9\u5dee 3) \u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u5e94\u5df2\u77e5\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03 4) \u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\u7edf\u8ba1/\u5f31\u503c/\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u4e09\u5927\u7406\u8bba\u4f53\u7cfb", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u590d\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u66f4\u6574\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u5960\u5b9a\u66f4\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054"}}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "In contrast to classical cryptography, where the security of encoded messages typically relies on the inability of standard algorithms to overcome computational complexity assumptions, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can enable two spatially separated parties to establish an information-theoretically secure encryption, provided that the QKD protocol is underpinned by a security proof. In the last decades, security proofs robust against a wide range of eavesdropping strategies have established the theoretical soundness of several QKD protocols. However, most proofs are based on idealized models of the physical systems involved in such protocols and often include assumptions that are not satisfied in practical implementations. This mismatch creates a gap between theoretical security guarantees and actual experimental realizations, making QKD protocols vulnerable to attacks. To ensure the security of real-world QKD systems, it is therefore essential to account for imperfections in security analyses. In this article, we present an overview of recent analytical and numerical developments in QKD security proofs, which provide a versatile approach for incorporating imperfections and re-establishing the security of quantum communication protocols under realistic conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1(QKD)\u5b89\u5168\u8bc1\u660e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u7eb3\u5165\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u800cQKD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u8bc1\u660e\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8131\u8282\u4f7fQKD\u534f\u8bae\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6027\u5bf9\u786e\u4fdd\u5b9e\u9645QKD\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86QKD\u5b89\u5168\u8bc1\u660e\u4e2d\u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7eb3\u5165\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u5efa\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc1\u660e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u91cd\u65b0\u5efa\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fc5\u987b\u5c06\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u771f\u5b9eQKD\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u65b0\u53d1\u5c55\u7684 versatile \u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u60f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid. We identify this energy scale and relate the motion of these giant bubbles with varying external field to the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies.

Given black-box query access to an unknown FLO, previous proposals required $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^5 / \\varepsilon^2)$ queries, where $n$ is the system size and $\\varepsilon$ is the error in diamond distance. These algorithms also use unphysical operations (i.e., violating fermionic superselection rules) and/or $n$ auxiliary modes to prepare Choi states of the FLO. In this work, we establish efficient and experimentally friendly protocols that obey superselection, use minimal ancilla (at most $1$ extra mode), and exhibit improved dependence on both parameters $n$ and $\\varepsilon$. For arbitrary (active) FLOs this algorithm makes at most $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^4 / \\varepsilon)$ queries, while for number-conserving (passive) FLOs we show that $\\mathcal{O}(n^3 / \\varepsilon)$ queries suffice.

While large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced dialogue capabilities, most current systems still rely on cascaded architectures that connect independent modules. These pipelines are often plagued by accumulated errors, high latency, and poor real-time performance. Lacking access to the underlying conversational context, these pipelines inherently prioritize rigid lip-sync over emotional depth. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar large language model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion within a unified framework. To facilitate training, we introduce FLAME-QA, a high-quality multimodal dataset designed to align semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics within a QA format. By leveraging deep semantic understanding, A$^2$-LLM generates emotionally rich facial movements beyond simple lip-synchronization. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves superior emotional expressiveness while maintaining real-time efficiency (500 ms latency, 0.7 RTF).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faA$^2$-LLM\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5bf9\u8bdd\u97f3\u9891\u5934\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u97f5\u5f8b\u548c3D\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ea7\u8054\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u3001\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u60c5\u50f5\u786c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f53\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u7684A$^2$-LLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6FLAME-QA\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u8868\u60c5\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6548\u7387\uff08500ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c0.7 RTF\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ea7\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The resulting interactions are geometry-aware and inspired by inverse-square interactions in physics. Our method, Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat Kernels (SLAY), constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere so that attention depends only on angular alignment. Using Bernstein's theorem, we express the spherical Yat-kernel as a nonnegative mixture of polynomial-exponential product kernels and derive a strictly positive random-feature approximation enabling linear-time O(L) attention. We establish positive definiteness and boundedness on the sphere and show that the estimator yields well-defined, nonnegative attention scores. Empirically, SLAY achieves performance that is nearly indistinguishable from standard softmax attention while retaining linear time and memory scaling, and consistently outperforms prior linear-time attention mechanisms such as Performers and Cosformers.

We propose an entangled photon pair-enhanced multidimensional spectroscopic technique which is sensitive to exciton-exciton interactions and correlations at the ultrafast timescale. Simulations for a dissipative photosynthetic aggregate reveal the superior ability of entangled photon pairs, compared to both transform-limited and frequency-chirped laser pulses, to manipulate excited-state absorption pathways. The corresponding spectral features in the two-dimensional spectrogram are interpreted in terms of one- and two-exciton resonances. The signal scales linearly with the incoming intensity of the photon sources. It is argued that classifying these resonances using entangled photon source at the perturbative limit allow for probing exciton correlations at the natural energy scale.

While existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods provide useful insights, they face the following two limitations. (i) They cannot handle heterogeneous tensor streams, which comprises both categorical attributes(e.g., IP address) and continuous attributes(e.g., packet length). They typically require either discretizing continuous attributes or treating categorical attributes as continuous, both of which distort the underlying statistical properties of the data.Furthermore, incorrect assumptions about the distribution family of continuous attributes often degrade the model's performance. (ii) They discretize timestamps, failing to track the temporal dynamics of streams(e.g., trends, abnormal events), which makes them ineffective for detecting anomalies at the group level, referred to as 'group anomalies' (e.g, DoS attacks). To address these challenges, we propose HeteroComp, a method for continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into 'components' representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics, and detecting group anomalies. Our method employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes, and temporal dynamics, which directly estimate probability densities from data.

However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs.

However, the mechanistic realization of this behavior remains obscure, specifically how the model resolves these knowledge conflicts through compliance, and whether this suppression arises from signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration within the residual stream. To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components. Our empirical results reject the universality of the \"Manifold Dilution\" hypothesis, as two of the three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite exhibiting significant performance degradation on factual queries. Instead, we observed that compliance is consistently characterized by \"Orthogonal Interference,\" where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation. This suggests that models do not \"unlearn\" or suppress the magnitude of internal truths but rather employ a mechanism of geometric displacement to bypass the correct unembedding vector, effectively simulating adoption while preserving the original structural magnitude.

To reduce resource consumption and accelerate inference, it is essential to eliminate redundant parameters without compromising performance. However, conventional pruning methods that directly remove such parameters often lead to a dramatic drop in model performance in reasoning tasks, and require extensive post-training to recover the lost capabilities. In this work, we propose a gradual compacting method that divides the compression process into multiple fine-grained iterations, applying a Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) at each stage to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance with finetuning. This iterative approach-reminiscent of the \"boiling frog\" effect-enables the model to be progressively compressed without abrupt performance loss. Experimental results show that PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, while maintaining performance comparable to the original model on reasoning tasks. Moreover, PTL is flexible and can be applied to various pruning strategies, such as neuron pruning and layer pruning, as well as different post-training methods, including continual pre-training and reinforcement learning.

Most previous multimodal models are trained on perfectly paired multimodal input to reach optimal performance.

In this paper, we present a novel Cyclic INformative Learning framework (CyIN) to bridge the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning. Specifically, we firstly build an informative latent space by adopting token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among various modalities. Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model.

In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \\emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \\emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning.

Existing approaches often fail when the solution operator exhibits strong sensitivity to boundary forcings. We propose a general framework for conditioning neural operators on complex non-homogeneous BCs through function extensions. Our key idea is to map boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions defined over the entire spatial domain, enabling any standard operator learning architecture to consume boundary information. The resulting operator, coupled with an arbitrary domain-to-domain neural operator, can learn rich dependencies on complex BCs and input domain functions at the same time. To benchmark this setting, we construct 18 challenging datasets spanning Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity problems, with highly variable, mixed-type, component-wise, and multi-segment BCs on diverse geometries. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming baselines by large margins, while requiring no hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Overall, our results demonstrate that learning boundary-to-domain extensions is an effective and practical strategy for imposing complex BCs in existing neural operator frameworks, enabling accurate and robust scientific machine learning models for a broader range of PDE-governed problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u51fd\u6570\u5ef6\u62d3\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u975e\u9f50\u6b21\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5168\u57df\u6f5c\u5728\u4f2a\u5ef6\u62d3\uff0c\u4f7f\u6807\u51c6\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u57df\u5185\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u572818\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684PDE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u5bf9\u8fb9\u754c\u5f3a\u8feb\u9879\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ecf\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51fd\u6570\u5ef6\u62d3\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f2a\u5ef6\u62d3\uff0c\u4f7f\u4efb\u4f55\u6807\u51c6\u57df\u5230\u57df\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u90fd\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u57df\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6db5\u76d6\u6cca\u677e\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u7ebf\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u8d85\u5f39\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u768418\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5206\u91cf\u5f0f\u548c\u591a\u6bb5\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95f4\u65e0\u9700\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u8fb9\u754c\u5230\u57df\u7684\u5ef6\u62d3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u65bd\u52a0\u590d\u6742\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684PDE\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, existing security proofs are limited to static digital signal processing algorithms, while practical systems rely on dynamic multiple-input multiple-output algorithms to compensate for time-varying channel impairments. Our analysis reveals that the conventional dynamic algorithm, due to its non-unitary nature, systematically underestimates the excess noise, which in turn leads to security issues and the generation of insecure keys. To close this gap, we propose a secure algorithm model, mapping the dynamic algorithm to an equivalent physical optical model whose security can be rigorously assessed. Simulations illustrate the algorithm's non-unitary property and provide a quantitative analysis of the excess noise underestimation caused by the conventional algorithm. We further experimentally validate the necessity of the proposed modeling for dynamic digital signal processing, achieving a secret key rate of 14.4 Mbps based on estimated excess noise of 0.07 shot noise unit; whereas the conventional algorithm would have dangerously overestimated the key rate to 28.2 Mbps with noise of 0.008 shot noise unit.

While recent AVQA models have high accuracy, their ability to identify when they are likely wrong and their consequent abstention from answering remain underexplored areas of research. To fill this gap, we explore several approaches and then propose Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method to further enhance the performance of $\\mathcal{R}$-AVQA. Our key insight is that the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration, a condition usually not met in deep neural networks, particularly in multimodal models. Instead of replacing MSP, our ACR maintains it as a primary confidence signal and applies input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is deemed unreliable. ACR introduces two learned heads: i) a Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP does not capture, and ii) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness.

We establish three time scales that govern the dynamics, each with distinct characteristics. For times short compared to the Ehrenfest time, the evolution is classical, characterized by Gaussian dynamics. For sufficiently long times, as we increase the initial photon number, unitary Kerr evolution would generate macroscopic superpositions of coherent states (so-called kitten states), but this is severely restricted in the presence of small photon loss so that expectation values of observables coincide with their classical values. The intermediate time scale, however, shows resilient quantum behavior in the macroscopic limit. We show that in the mean-field non-Gaussian regime, the Kerr Hamiltonian (with small photon loss) generates a significant amount of Wigner-negativity, and classical flow is recovered only if the loss rate grows with system size. Our results broaden the usual understanding of quantum-to-classical transitions and demonstrate the potential for creating robust nonclassical resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing in the presence of loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u542b\u635f\u8017\u5355\u6a21\u514b\u5c14\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ece\u91cf\u5b50\u5230\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e09\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff1a\u77ed\u65f6\uff08\u57c3\u4f26\u8d39\u65af\u7279\u65f6\u95f4\u524d\uff09\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u9ad8\u65af\u6f14\u5316\uff1b\u957f\u65f6\u56e0\u635f\u8017\u6291\u5236\u5b8f\u89c2\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\uff08\u732b\u6001\uff09\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f7f\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u503c\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u4e2d\u95f4\u65f6\u6807\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u5f3a\u97e7\u91cf\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u7ef4\u683c\u7eb3\u8d1f\u6027\u3002\u7ecf\u5178\u6062\u590d\u9700\u635f\u8017\u7387\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u589e\u957f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u635f\u8017\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u8fc7\u6e21\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u6297\u635f\u8017\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u542b\u635f\u8017\u514b\u5c14\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u671f\u671b\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u7ef4\u683c\u7eb3\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u635f\u8017\u867d\u6291\u5236\u957f\u65f6\u5b8f\u89c2\u91cf\u5b50\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u95f4\u65f6\u6807\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\uff08\u7ef4\u683c\u7eb3\u8d1f\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f53\u635f\u8017\u7387\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u589e\u957f\u65f6\u624d\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u7ecf\u5178\u6d41\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u542b\u635f\u8017\u514b\u5c14\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6210\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning.

Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions.

However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes. Recently, BoA improved upon GPTQ by incorporating inter-layer dependencies within attention modules, but its reliance on sequential quantization across all out-channels makes it substantially less efficient.

While most Barren Plateau analyses focus on single-qubit rotation gates, the gradient behavior of Parameterized Quantum Circuits built from multi-qubit gates remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a general theoretical framework for analyzing the gradient properties of Parameterized Quantum Circuits with multi-qubit gates. Our method generalizes the direct computation framework, bypassing the Haar random assumption on parameters and enabling the calculation of the gradient expectation and variance.

Although nonlinear interaction is essential for generating entanglement, during signal accumulation, it becomes detrimental and therefore must be suppressed. To address this challenge, we propose an alternating in-phase and quadrature modulation (AIQM) scheme, designed to operate under a fixed nonlinear interaction. During signal accumulation, our time-interleaved approach sequentially applies the in-phase and quadrature driving fields, thereby eliminating the effects of nonlinear interaction on signal accumulation. Our AIQM scheme achieves better metrological performance than conventional schemes, particularly under strong nonlinear interaction and prolonged signal accumulation, with pronounced robustness against parameter variations. By selectively eliminating and utilizing nonlinear interactions via AIQM, our work enables high-precision and high-accuracy entanglement-enhanced sensing without the need for active control of the nonlinear interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u66ff\u540c\u76f8\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u8c03\u5236\uff08AIQM\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u5e8f\u4ea4\u9519\u65bd\u52a0\u9a71\u52a8\u573a\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8ba1\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ea7\u751f\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u79ef\u7d2f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5229\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u8981\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ea4\u66ff\u540c\u76f8\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u8c03\u5236\uff08AIQM\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u9519\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f9d\u6b21\u65bd\u52a0\u540c\u76f8\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u9a71\u52a8\u573a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6d88\u9664\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "AIQM\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\u79ef\u7d2f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7AIQM\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u6d88\u9664\u548c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ea0\u7f20\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u611f\u3002"}}

To be published in the VISAPP", "summary": "Hyperbolic representation learning has been widely used to extract implicit hierarchies within data, and recently it has found its way to the open-world classification task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). However, prior hyperbolic GCD methods only use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning and transform back to Euclidean geometry when clustering. We hypothesize this is suboptimal. Therefore, we present Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry, and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm. We test our model on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that HC-GCD is on par with the previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method. Furthermore, we show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. We carry out ablation studies showing that clipping the norm of the Euclidean embeddings leads to decreased accuracy in clustering unseen classes, and increased accuracy for seen classes, while the overall accuracy is dataset dependent. We also show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to more consistent clusters when varying the label granularity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHC-GCD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f4\u63a5\u5b8c\u6210\u5e7f\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u53d1\u73b0(GCD)\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u66f2K-Means\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6b27\u6c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53cc\u66f2GCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u805a\u7c7b\u65f6\u8f6c\u6362\u56de\u6b27\u6c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u6b21\u4f18\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "1) \u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u66f2K-Means\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b3) \u5206\u6790\u6b27\u6c0f\u5d4c\u5165\u8303\u6570\u88c1\u526a\u5bf9\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "1) HC-GCD\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u53cc\u66f2GCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2) \u53cc\u66f2K-Means\u6bd4\u6b27\u6c0fK-Means\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b3) \u8303\u6570\u88c1\u526a\u964d\u4f4e\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f46\u63d0\u5347\u5df2\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b4) \u53cc\u66f2\u805a\u7c7b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6807\u7b7e\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u7a0b\u4fdd\u6301\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5904\u7406\u5bf9GCD\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u53cc\u66f2K-Means\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Implementing such unitaries on fault-tolerant devices requires first compiling them into a discrete universal gate set, typically Clifford$+T$. Here, we propose a different approach for their synthesis: compile matchgate unitaries using only matchgate gates. To this end, we first show that the matchgate-Clifford group (the intersection of the matchgate and Clifford groups) plus the $\\overline{T}$ gate (a $T$ unitary up to a phase) is universal for the matchgate group. Our approach leverages the connection between $n$-qubit matchgate circuits and the standard representation of $\\mathbb{SO}(2n)$, which reduces the compilation from $2^n\\times 2^n$ unitaries to $2n\\times2n$ ones, thus reducing exponentially the size of the target matrix. Moreover, we rigorously show that this scheme is efficient, as an approximation error $\\varepsilon_{\\mathbb{SO}(2n)}$ incurred in this smaller-dimensional representation translates at most into an $O(n \\,\\varepsilon_{\\mathbb{SO}(2n)})$ error in the exponentially large unitary. In addition, we study the exact version of the matchgate synthesis problem, and we prove that all matchgate unitaries $U$ such that $U\\otimes U^*$ has entries in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}\\big[1/\\sqrt 2,i\\big]$ can be exactly synthesized by a finite sequence of gates from the matchgate-Clifford$+\\overline{T}$ set, without ancillas. We then use this insight to map optimal exact matchgate synthesis to Boolean satisfiability, and compile the circuits that diagonalize the free-fermionic $XX$ Hamiltonian on $n=4,\\,8$ qubits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5339\u914d\u95e8\uff08matchgate\uff09\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u7535\u8def\u6765\u7f16\u8bd1\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684Clifford+T\u95e8\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06n\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u7535\u8def\u4e0eSO(2n)\u8868\u793a\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5c06\u7f16\u8bd1\u95ee\u9898\u4ece2^n\u00d72^n\u9149\u77e9\u9635\u964d\u7ef4\u81f32n\u00d72n\u6b63\u4ea4\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5339\u914d\u95e8-Clifford\u7fa4\u52a0\u4e0aT\u95e8\uff08\u5e26\u76f8\u4f4d\uff09\u5bf9\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u7fa4\u662f\u901a\u7528\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u65e0\u5904\u4e0d\u5728\uff08\u4e0e\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u3002\u5728\u5bb9\u9519\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u7c7b\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u5176\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u901a\u7528\u95e8\u96c6\uff08\u5982Clifford+T\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u4ec5\u7528\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u95e8\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u8bd1\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bc1\u660e\u5339\u914d\u95e8-Clifford\u7fa4\u52a0T\u0305\u95e8\u5bf9\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u7fa4\u662f\u901a\u7528\u7684\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528n\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u7535\u8def\u4e0eSO(2n)\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5c062^n\u00d72^n\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\u7f16\u8bd1\u95ee\u9898\u964d\u7ef4\u4e3a2n\u00d72n\u6b63\u4ea4\u77e9\u9635\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3) \u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff1a\u5728SO(2n)\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u03b5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u539f\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\u4e2dO(n\u03b5)\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b4) \u7814\u7a76\u7cbe\u786e\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u53ef\u88ab\u7cbe\u786e\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\u96c6\u5408\uff08U\u2297U*\u5143\u7d20\u5c5e\u4e8eZ[1/\u221a2,i]\uff09\uff1b5) \u5c06\u6700\u4f18\u7cbe\u786e\u5408\u6210\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u5e03\u5c14\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1b6) \u4e3an=4,8\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50XX\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7f16\u8bd1\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u7535\u8def\u3002", "result": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u4ec5\u7528\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u7f16\u8bd1\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\uff1b2) \u5b9e\u73b0\u7f16\u8bd1\u95ee\u9898\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u964d\u7ef4\uff082^n\u00d72^n \u2192 2n\u00d72n\uff09\uff1b3) \u8bef\u5dee\u7f29\u653e\u4e3aO(n\u03b5)\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\uff1b4) \u5b8c\u5168\u523b\u753b\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\u96c6\u5408\uff1b5) \u6210\u529f\u4e3aXX\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7f16\u8bd1n=4,8\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u7535\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u7535\u8def\u7f16\u8bd1\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53c8\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5339\u914d\u95e8\u9149\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We present Transolver-3, a new member of the Transolver family as a highly scalable framework designed for high-fidelity physics simulations. To bridge the gap between limited GPU capacity and the resolution requirements of complex engineering tasks, we introduce two key architectural optimizations: faster slice and deslice by exploiting matrix multiplication associative property and geometry slice tiling to partition the computation of physical states. Combined with an amortized training strategy by learning on random subsets of original high-resolution meshes and a physical state caching technique during inference, Transolver-3 enables high-fidelity field prediction on industrial-scale meshes.

To enable a data-driven benchmarking methodology for quantum devices that accounts for both solution quality and the classical computational cost of inference from noisy measurements, we introduce deterministic error mitigation (DEM), a shot-level inference procedure informed by experimentally characterized noise. We demonstrate this approach using the decision version of the $k$-independent set problem. Within a Hamming-shell framework, the DEM candidate volume is governed by the binary entropy of the bit-flip error rate, yielding an entropy-controlled classical postprocessing cost.

We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth.

However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce \u03c0-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that \u03c0-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI.

In this paper, we focus on the single-shot discrimination of two noisy quantum channels using two distinct classes of probes: single-system (product) probes and entangled probes. Our aim is to identify optimal probing state for specific discrimination tasks and to analyze the necessity and role of entanglement in enhancing channel distinguishability. We show that maximally entangled probes are optimal for discriminating two qubit depolarizing channels, with any nonzero entanglement providing an advantage over single-system probes. In contrast, for dephasing channels in arbitrary dimensions, we prove that single-system probe can be optimal and that entanglement offers no improvement, even when the dephasing unitary is generalized. For qubit amplitude-damping channels, we identify distinct noise-dependent regimes in which either single-system probe outperforms maximally entangled probes and vice-versa. Moreover, we demonstrate that non-maximally entangled probes can act as the optimum probe if the noise parameters restricted to certain values in this task. We also present examples of noisy unitary channels for which discrimination is possible using non-maximally entangled probe, while both single-systems and maximally entangled probes fail.

Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6781\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u95f4\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRaBiT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u5f3a\u5236\u6b8b\u5dee\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e8c\u503c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5404\u8def\u5f84\u5bf9\u524d\u5e8f\u8def\u5f84\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9010\u5c42\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5728RTX 4090\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f974.49\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6781\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u3002\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u867d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u65e0\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8def\u5f84\u95f4\u9002\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e76\u884c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8def\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\u5197\u4f59\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u8bef\u5dee\u8865\u507f\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRaBiT\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f3a\u5236\u5efa\u7acb\u6b8b\u5dee\u5c42\u7ea7\uff1a\u4ece\u5171\u4eab\u7684FP\u6743\u91cd\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u5bfc\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e8c\u503c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u6821\u6b63\u524d\u5e8f\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u8c03\u529f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e862\u6bd4\u7279\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u786c\u4ef6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u77e2\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728RTX 4090\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b04.49\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "RaBiT\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\uff082-bit\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents.

If the bosons are injected periodically into the input modes of the interferometer and optical feedback lines' length match the period of injection, it allows for interference between bosons injected at the consequent time iterations. We propose several methods methods for computing the output photon distributions in both output spacial and temporal modes, including not only standard spatiotemporal mode-unfolding technique, but also the Kraus-operator formalism, and a correlation-tensor-based approach. The two latter approaches help us to reveal that for random interferometers this system evolves to a unique stationary state over time.

However, the mathematical understanding of its principles, as well as the optimization of its solution speed and accuracy, remain unclear. In this work, we for the first time systematically discuss multiple implementations of AIM and establish a unified mathematical formulation. On this basis, by treating the binarization constraint of AIM (such as injection locking) as a Lagrange multiplier in optimization theory and combining it with a Lyapunov analysis from dynamical systems theory, an analytical framework for evaluating solution speed and accuracy is constructed, and further demonstrate that conventional AIMs possess a theoretical performance upper bound. Subsequently, by elevating the binarization constraint to a control variable, we propose the controllable analog Ising machine (CAIM), which integrates control Lyapunov functions and momentum-based optimization algorithms to realize adaptive sampling-feedback control, thereby surpassing the performance limits of conventional AIMs. In a proof-of-concept CAIM demonstration implemented using an FPGA-controlled LC-oscillator Ising machine, CAIM achieves a twofold speedup and a 7\\% improvement in accuracy over AIM on a 50-node all-to-all weighted MaxCut problem, validating both the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed theoretical framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u63a7\u6a21\u62df\u4f0a\u8f9b\u673a(CAIM)\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edfAIM\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u5347\u7ef4\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a7\u5236Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u52a8\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u572850\u8282\u70b9MaxCut\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u7ffb\u500d\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u53477%", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u4f0a\u8f9b\u673a(AIM)\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u4e0d\u6e05\uff0c\u89e3\u901f\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42", "method": "1) \u5efa\u7acbAIM\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6 2) \u5c06\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u4e58\u5b50 3) \u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edfLyapunov\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb 4) \u63d0\u51faCAIM\u5c06\u7ea6\u675f\u5347\u7ef4\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236", "result": "FPGA\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684LC\u632f\u8361\u5668CAIM\u539f\u578b\u572850\u8282\u70b9\u5168\u8fde\u63a5MaxCut\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfAIM\u5b9e\u73b02\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u548c7%\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "CAIM\u6210\u529f\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edfAIM\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u5efa\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model.

Moreover, in comparison with the Choi-state scheme, the process-matrix representation is employed to simultaneously reconstruct sparse noise and a broader range of target quantum gates. Our results demonstrate that significant reduction in experimental configurations is achievable even under corrupted noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c42\u6790\u6210\u50cf\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0 corrupted \u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u91cd\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5b9e\u9a8c\u914d\u7f6e\u9700\u6c42", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c42\u6790\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u542b corrupted \u566a\u58f0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8/\u901a\u9053\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u672c", "method": "1) \u57fa\u4e8eChoi\u6001\u8868\u793a\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e7f\u4e49\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u8ddd\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u540c\u6b65\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u91cd\u5efa\u7a00\u758f\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u8fc7\u7a0b", "result": "\u5728 corrupted \u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u914d\u7f6e\u9700\u6c42\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u77e9\u9635\u65b9\u6848\u6bd4Choi\u6001\u65b9\u6848\u9002\u7528\u66f4\u5e7f", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c42\u6790\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u542b\u566a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u65bd\u4f18\u52bf"}}

Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c16\u5cf0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(TSFMs)\uff0c\u5728\u6ce2\u52a8\u5267\u70c8\u7684\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86TSFMs\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347MAPE\u8fbe37.4%\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u529b\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4ef7\u683c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u6574\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u901a\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u6ce2\u52a8\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u65e5\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c16\u5cf0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30Tiny Time Mixers\u3001MOIRAI\u3001MOMENT\u548cTimesFM\u7b49TSFMs\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eARIMA\u3001LSTM\u3001CNN-LSTM\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u6ce2\u52a8\u5267\u70c8\u7684\u534a\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ea7\u6279\u53d1\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u5929\u6c14\u548c\u65e5\u5386\u7b49\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "TSFMs\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0bMAPE\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534737.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6ce2\u52a8\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, in-context examples may contain privacy-sensitive information that should not be revealed through model outputs. Existing differential privacy (DP) approaches to ICL are either computationally expensive or rely on heuristics with limited effectiveness, including context oversampling, synthetic data generation, or unnecessary thresholding.

This is enabled by their long longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) coherence times and precise control using radio frequency pulses. In this thesis, I present my work using nuclear spins to explore these themes.\n  First, I study temporal quantum correlations quantified by the Leggett Garg inequality (LGI) for a qubit evolving under a superposition of unitary operators. Using a three qubit quantum register, we experimentally realized superposed unitaries and observed LGI violations exceeding the maximal quantum bound of 1.5, indicating enhanced non-classicality. Notably, this superposed unitary dynamics also showed improved robustness against decoherence.\n  Next, I investigate Lee Yang zeros, which are zeros of the partition function in the complex plane that reveal thermodynamic behavior near criticality. We proposed and experimentally demonstrated a method to determine the full set of Lee Yang zeros of an asymmetric Ising model using a single quantum probe in a three-qubit nuclear spin register. We further showed that the mutual information between the probe and system peaks at times corresponding to these zeros.\n  I then report our study of the quantum Mpemba effect in nuclear spin relaxation, where systems farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to steady state, verified both theoretically and experimentally using NMR. Finally, I discuss our work on entanglement localization and delocalization induced by local interactions, leading to an apparent violation of the quantum data processing inequality. We showed that this violation is only apparent by constructing a completely positive and trace preserving map describing the dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NMR\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\uff1a1)\u53e0\u52a0\u5e7a\u6b63\u6f14\u5316\u4e0b\u7684Leggett-Garg\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8d85\u91cf\u5b50\u754c\u8fdd\u53cd\uff1b2)\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0Ising\u6a21\u578bLee-Yang\u96f6\u70b9\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u63a2\u6d4b\uff1b3)\u91cf\u5b50Mpemba\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b4)\u7ea0\u7f20\u5b9a\u57df\u5316/\u53bb\u5b9a\u57df\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8868\u89c2\u8fdd\u53cd\u53ca\u5176CPTP\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u5176\u8d85\u957f\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4(T1/T2)\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5c04\u9891\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u60f3\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u591a\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f(NMR)\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u591a\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53e0\u52a0\u5e7a\u6b63\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001Ising\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u5f1b\u8c6b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5c40\u57df\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u53e0\u52a0\u5e7a\u6b63\u6f14\u5316\u4e0b\u7684Leggett-Garg\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8fdd\u53cd\u503c\u8d85\u8fc71.5\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0Ising\u6a21\u578bLee-Yang\u96f6\u70b9\u96c6\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6d4b\u5b9a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u5bf9\u5e94\u65f6\u523b\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u8a00\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50Mpemba\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5c40\u57df\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u5b9a\u57df\u5316/\u53bb\u5b9a\u57df\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8868\u89c2\u4e0a\u8fdd\u53cd\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u5b9a\u4fdd\u8ff9\u6620\u5c04\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8be5\u8fdd\u53cd\u4ec5\u662f\u8868\u89c2\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u91cf\u5b50\u57fa\u7840\u68c0\u9a8c\u5230\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP).

To this end, we consider different programs based on the restriction of the evolution to the set of separable (i.e., non-entangled) states, together with the discretization of the space of variables for numerical computations. As a first approach, we apply linear splitting methods to the restricted, continuous equations of motion derived from variational principles. We utilize an exchange interaction Hamiltonian to confirm that the numerical and analytical solutions coincide in the limit of small time steps. The application to different Hamiltonians shows the wide applicability of the method to detect dynamical entanglement. To avoid the derivation of analytical solutions for complex dynamics, we consider variational, numerical integration schemes, introducing a variational discretization for Lagrangians linear in velocities. Here, we examine and compare two approaches: one in which the system is discretized before the restriction is applied, and another in which the restriction precedes the discretization. We find that the \"first-discretize-then-restrict\" method becomes numerically unstable, already for the example of an exchange-interaction Hamiltonian, which can be an important consideration for the numerical analysis of constrained quantum dynamics.

This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \\textbf{ALIVE} (\\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \\emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates.

Numerical results for inverse noise channels used in quantum error mitigation, including bosonic photon loss, confirm substantial reductions in resources and highlight scalability in higher-dimensional settings.

Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial.

In decision-time planning, state representations are critical as they must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. In this paper, we show that the Laplacian representation provides an effective latent space for planning by capturing state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances and naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, also mitigating the compounding errors that arise over long prediction horizons.

Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification.

This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics.

However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning.

However, the choice of base material also influences the sensitivity to quasiparticle-induced decoherence. In this study, we investigate quasiparticle tunneling rates in niobium and tantalum-based offset-charge-sensitive qubits. Using a source of thermal radiation, we characterize the sensitivity of either material to infrared radiation and explore the impact of the infrared background through the targeted use of in-line filters in the wiring and ambient infrared absorbers. We identify both radiation channels as significant contributions to decoherence for tantalum but not for niobium qubits and achieve tunneling rates of 100 Hz and 300 Hz for niobium and tantalum respectively upon installation of infrared filters. Additionally, we find a time-dependence in the observed tunneling rates on the scale of days, which we interpret as evidence of slowly cooling, thermally radiating components in the experimental setup.

One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance.

Our framework is based on a Galerkin discretization of the underlying variational forms, and its high efficiency stems from a novel highly-optimized and GPU-compliant TensorGalerkin framework for linear system assembly (stiffness matrices and load vectors). TensorGalerkin operates by tensorizing element-wise operations within a Python-level Map stage and then performs global reduction with a sparse matrix multiplication that performs message passing on the mesh-induced sparsity graph. It can be seamlessly employed downstream as i) a highly-efficient numerical PDEs solver, ii) an end-to-end differentiable framework for PDE-constrained optimization, and iii) a physics-informed operator learning algorithm for PDEs. With multiple benchmarks, including 2D and 3D elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on unstructured meshes, we demonstrate that the proposed framework provides significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains over a variety of baselines in all the targeted downstream applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3d\u8fbd\u91d1\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u548cTensorGalerkin\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u57282D/3D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u5927\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u5b9e\u73b0GPU\u52a0\u901f\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u4f3d\u8fbd\u91d1\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662fTensorGalerkin\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5728Python\u5c42\u9762\u5bf9\u5355\u5143\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u5f20\u91cf\u5316\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u7ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0GPU\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u521a\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u8f7d\u8377\u5411\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7ec4\u88c5\u3002", "result": "\u57282D/3D\u692d\u5706\u3001\u629b\u7269\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u578b\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u7f51\u683c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u3001\u53ef\u5fae\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4e2d\u5747\u76f8\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cTensorGalerkin\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7ec4\u88c5\u662f\u5176\u5173\u952e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742PDEs\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Given access to an unknown channel, a central problem is whether these transformations can be implemented physically with quantum supermaps. While such supermaps are known for unitary operations, the situation for general quantum channels is fundamentally different. In this work, we establish a strict hierarchy of physical realizability for the transposition, complex conjugation, and adjoint transformation of an unknown quantum channel. We present a probabilistic protocol that exactly implements the transpose with a single query. In contrast, we prove no-go theorems showing that neither the complex conjugate nor the adjoint can be implemented by any completely positive supermap, even probabilistically. We then overcome this impossibility by designing a virtual protocol for the complex conjugate based on quasi-probability decomposition, and show its optimality in terms of the diamond norm. As a key application, we propose a protocol to estimate the expectation values resulting from the Petz recovery map of an unknown channel, achieving an improved query complexity compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u8f6c\u7f6e\u3001\u590d\u5171\u8f6d\u3001\u4f34\u968f\uff09\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8d85\u6620\u5c04\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u8f6c\u7f6e\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u67e5\u8be2\u6982\u7387\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u590d\u5171\u8f6d\u548c\u4f34\u968f\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u4efb\u4f55\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u8d85\u6620\u5c04\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u590d\u5171\u8f6d\u7684\u865a\u62df\u534f\u8bae\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbPetz\u6062\u590d\u6620\u5c04\u671f\u671b\u503c\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5982\u8f6c\u7f6e\uff09\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u6362\u5982\u4f55\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u901a\u9053\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u8d85\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u901a\u9053\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8f6c\u7f6e\u7684\u6982\u7387\u534f\u8bae\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5355\u67e5\u8be2\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u590d\u5171\u8f6d\u548c\u4f34\u968f\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u8d85\u6620\u5c04\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u5171\u8f6d\u7684\u865a\u62df\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u94bb\u77f3\u8303\u6570\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u5f00\u53d1Petz\u6062\u590d\u6620\u5c04\u671f\u671b\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f6c\u7f6e\u7684\u5355\u67e5\u8be2\u6982\u7387\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u590d\u5171\u8f6d\u548c\u4f34\u968f\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\uff1b\u865a\u62df\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u94bb\u77f3\u8303\u6570\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\uff1bPetz\u6620\u5c04\u671f\u671b\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u534f\u8bae\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9650\u5236\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0c\u865a\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u514b\u670d\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u3002"}}

This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types. The model's ability to respond to changing weather conditions and generalize across road segments shows promise for real-world deployment, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u8350\u5b89\u5168\u8f66\u901f\u533a\u95f4", "motivation": "\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u548c\u8def\u9762\u6469\u64e6\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b89\u5168\u8f66\u901f\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8b\u6545\u98ce\u9669", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e03\u6cd5\u7f572022-2023\u5e74660\u4e07\u6761\u7f51\u8054\u8f66\u548c\u9053\u8def\u5929\u6c14\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u68ee\u6797(QRF)\u9884\u6d4b\u8f66\u901f\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8def\u9762\u9644\u7740\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9650\u901f\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u56fa\u5b9a\u9650\u901f\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u5b89\u5168\u8f66\u901f\u533a\u95f4", "result": "QRF\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee1.55 mph\uff0c96.43%\u7684\u4e2d\u4f4d\u8f66\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u57285 mph\u5185\uff0c50%\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e3a48.55%\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5929\u6c14\u548c\u8def\u6bb5\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u54cd\u5e94\u5929\u6c14\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8f66\u901f\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5929\u6c14\u76f8\u5173\u4e8b\u6545"}}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) achieves information-theoretic security, without relying on computational assumptions, by distributing quantum states. To establish secret bits, two honest parties exploit key distillation protocols over measurement outcomes resulting after the the distribution of quantum states. In this work, we establish a rigorous connection between the key rate achievable by applying two-way key distillation, such as advantage distillation, and quantum asymptotic hypothesis testing, via an integral representation of the relative entropy. This connection improves key rates at small to intermediate blocklengths relative to existing fidelity-based bounds and enables the computation of entropy bounds for intermediate to large blocklengths. Moreover, this connection allows one to close the gap between known sufficient and conjectured necessary conditions for key generation in the asymptotic regime, while the precise finite blocklegth conditions remain open.

Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

Based on this channel, we present a measurement-controlled sampling algorithm that generates thermal states together with their Hamiltonian \"labels\" for general physical models. We prove that the total gate count of our algorithm scales cubically with system size, quadratically with inverse temperature, and as the inverse error tolerance to the two-thirds power, with logarithmic dependence on the allowed failure probability. We also show that the induced label distribution approaches a normal distribution reweighted by the thermal partition function, which makes an explicit trade-off between accuracy and effective range. Numerical simulations for a 2D Heisenberg model validate the predicted scaling and distribution. As an application, we compute unfolding-free level-spacing ratio statistics from sampled thermal states of a 2D transverse-field Ising model and observe a crossover toward the Wigner--Dyson prediction, demonstrating a practical and scalable route to chaos diagnostics and random matrix universality studies on near-term quantum hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u70ed\u6f02\u79fb\u901a\u9053\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4f53\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u70ed\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u5316\u548c\u6df7\u6c8c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6848", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u70ed\u6001\u751f\u6210\u9700\u9010\u4e2a\u5236\u5907\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u70ed\u5316\u3001\u6df7\u6c8c\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "1. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u70ed\u6f02\u79fb\u901a\u9053\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u9149\u6f02\u79fb\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6cbf\u9009\u5b9a\u6ce1\u5229\u9879\u53ef\u8c03\u6f14\u5316 2. \u6784\u5efa\u53d7\u63a7\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u70ed\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6807\u7b7e 3. \u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6 4. \u901a\u8fc72D\u6d77\u68ee\u5821\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1", "result": "\u2022 \u603b\u95e8\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u7f29\u653e\uff1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7acb\u65b9\u7ea7(n\u00b3)\uff0c\u9006\u6e29\u5ea6\u5e73\u65b9\u7ea7(\u03b2\u00b2)\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u5bb9\u9650-2/3\u6b21\u65b9\u7ea7(1/\u03b5^{2/3})\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u6982\u7387\u5bf9\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56 \u2022 \u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u914d\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u8303\u56f4 \u2022 2D\u6a2a\u573a\u4f0a\u8f9b\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u7ea7\u95f4\u8ddd\u7edf\u8ba1\u5411Wigner-Dyson\u9884\u6d4b\u4ea4\u53c9", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u70ed\u6001\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df7\u6c8c\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u666e\u9002\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u70ed\u6f02\u79fb\u901a\u9053\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411"}}

However, the application of quantum algorithms to integer optimization problems remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we study the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) applied to integer problems on graphs, with each integer variable encoded in a qudit. We derive a general iterative formula for depth-$p$ QAOA expectation on high-girth $d$-regular graphs of arbitrary size. The cost of evaluating the formula is exponential in the QAOA depth $p$ but does not depend on the graph size. Evaluating this formula for Max-$k$-Cut problem for $p\\leq 4$, we identify parameter regimes ($k=3$ with degree $d \\leq 10$ and $k=4$ with $d \\leq 40$) in which QAOA outperforms the Frieze-Jerrum semi-definite programming (SDP) algorithm, which provides the best worst-case guarantee on the approximation ratio. To strengthen the classical baseline we introduce a new heuristic algorithm, based on the degree-of-saturation, that empirically outperforms both the Frieze-Jerrum algorithm and shallow-depth QAOA. Nevertheless, we provide numerical evidence that QAOA may overtake this heuristic at depth $p\\leq 20$.

This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7535\u8def(RCs)\u548cResin\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u590d\u6742\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a8\u65ad\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u901f\u7387", "method": "1) \u5f00\u53d1Resin\u6982\u7387\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6982\u7387\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7f16\u7a0b\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7535\u8def(RCs)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u6570\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5143\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u968f\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u53f7\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u5316\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5272\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5b50\u95ee\u9898", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u9891\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u7ed3\u6784\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u4ec5\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u6d41\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u5904\u7406\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

A Reliability Metric for XAI", "comment": null, "summary": "In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets.

In this model, both the encoding and decoding of classical information in quantum systems are implemented by measurements in either the computational or the Hadamard basis. Using the quantum wiretap channel theory, we study the secure net bit rates and certify information-theoretic security of different implementations of our model when the quantum channel is subjected to BB84-symmetric attacks.

Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.\n  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional \"anxiety\" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.\n  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt (\"bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem\"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.\n  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology. We argue that constraints do not limit creativity but enable it: just as grammar makes poetry possible, ontology makes structured generation possible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u672c\u4f53\"\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6267\u884cPydantic\u6a21\u5f0f\u548cDSPy\u7b7e\u540d\u7ea6\u675fLLM\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5bcc\u6709\u521b\u610f\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5GameGrammar\u684c\u6e38\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u672c\u4f53\u64c5\u957f\u9886\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u5185\u5bb9\uff0cLLM\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7545\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff08\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff09\u3002\u9700\u878d\u5408\u4e8c\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\uff1a\u672c\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ea6\u675f\uff0cLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u521b\u9020\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884cPydantic\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528DSPy\u7b7e\u540d\u7ea6\u675fLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5404\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u627f\u62c5\u4e13\u4e1a\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u673a\u68b0\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u7f16\u7ec7\u8005\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\uff09\u5e76\u690d\u5165\u804c\u4e1a\"\u7126\u8651\"\u9632\u6b62\u80a4\u6d45\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u786e\u4fdd\u673a\u5236-\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0GameGrammar\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u4e3b\u9898\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5982\"\u6d1e\u7a74\u4e2d\u751f\u7269\u53d1\u5149\u771f\u83cc\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\"\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u53ef\u73a9\u7684\u684c\u6e38\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u673a\u5236\u3001\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u80dc\u5229\u6761\u4ef6\u7b49\uff0c\u65e2\u6ee1\u8db3\u672c\u4f53\u7ea6\u675f\u53c8\u5177\u771f\u5b9e\u521b\u610f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5177\u5907\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bcd\u6c47\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5e93\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u97f3\u4e50\u3001\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u70f9\u996a\u7b49\uff09\u3002\u8bba\u8bc1\u7ea6\u675f\u8d4b\u80fd\u800c\u975e\u9650\u5236\u521b\u9020\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u4f53\u4f7f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u5982\u8bed\u6cd5\u4f7f\u8bd7\u6b4c\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoDiscover adapts active learning for systematic literature reviews by combining heterogeneous graph attention networks with discounted Thompson sampling to dynamically optimize document screening, significantly improving efficiency especially in cold-start scenarios.", "motivation": "Manual screening in SLRs is a bottleneck due to growing scientific output, low prevalence of relevant studies, and scarce expert decisions.

Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency \"Sweet Spots\" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u4f30\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u6548\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u8bbf\u5b58\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff081B-9B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b01.79%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\"\u80fd\u6548\u751c\u70b9\u533a\"\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u7b97LLM\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u80fd\u6548\u533a\u95f4\uff1a\u77ed\u81f3\u4e2d\u7b49\u8f93\u5165\u914d\u5408\u4e2d\u7b49\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u80fd\u6548\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fc7\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u8fc7\u77ed\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u80fd\u6548\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u6548\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528TensorRT-LLM\u5728NVIDIA H100 GPU\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd56\u7c7b1B-9B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff08OPT/LLaMA/Gemma\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d664-4096 token\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u52301.79%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAPE\uff09\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\"\u751c\u70b9\u533a\"\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u622a\u65ad\u3001\u6458\u8981\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u751c\u70b9\u533a\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA.

However, rubric generation remains hard to control: rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, misalign preference direction, and contain redundant or highly correlated criteria, degrading judge accuracy and producing suboptimal rewards during RFT. We propose RRD, a principled framework for rubric refinement built on a recursive decompose-filter cycle. RRD decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained, discriminative criteria, expanding coverage while sharpening separation between responses. A complementary filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant rubrics, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representing highly correlated criteria, yielding rubric sets that are informative, comprehensive, and non-redundant. Empirically, RRD delivers large, consistent gains across both evaluation and training: it improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE for both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B judges, achieving top performance in all settings with up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench. When used as the reward source for RFT on WildChat, it yields substantially stronger and more stable learning signals, boosting reward by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus 10-20% for prior rubric baselines, with gains that transfer to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench.

However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51faRLVR\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u7a7a\u95f4\u574d\u7f29(RSC)\u95ee\u9898\uff0cKL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f1a\u56e0\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u7ea6\u675f\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u951a\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316(APO)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u652f\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\u7a81\u7834\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u75c5\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u9012\u5f52\u7a7a\u95f4\u574d\u7f29(RSC)\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u6548\u9009\u9879\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6982\u7387\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u5730\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u4f20\u7edfKL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u91c7\u7528\u521a\u6027\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6240\u9700\u7684\u9510\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ea7\u751f\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u951a\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316(APO)\uff0c\u5c06\u8303\u5f0f\u4ece\u5168\u5c40\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u8f6c\u5411\u652f\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u652f\u6301\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b89\u5168\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7684\u9510\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u6b63\u671f\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u65bd\u52a0\u91cd\u6784\u529b\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u574d\u7f29\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eAPO\u662f\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f39\u6027\u6062\u590d\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6709\u6548\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAPO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347Pass@1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u4e27\u5931\u7684Pass@K\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "APO\u901a\u8fc7\u652f\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u800c\u975e\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RLVR\u4e2d\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u7a7a\u95f4\u574d\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Designing these pipelines requires substantial domain expertise and engineering effort, motivating the question of how large language models (LLMs) can support tabular ML through code synthesis. We introduce SemPipes, a novel declarative programming model that integrates LLM-powered semantic data operators into tabular ML pipelines. Semantic operators specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. This design enables the automatic optimization of data operations in a pipeline via LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search. We evaluate SemPipes across diverse tabular ML tasks and show that semantic operators substantially improve end-to-end predictive performance for both expert-designed and agent-generated pipelines, while reducing pipeline complexity.

Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model.

Although AdamW decouples weight decay from adaptive gradient scaling, a fundamental conflict remains: the Radial Tug-of-War. In deep learning, gradients tend to increase parameter norms to expand effective capacity while steering directions to learn features, whereas weight decay indiscriminately suppresses norm growth. This push--pull interaction induces radial oscillations, injecting noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and potentially degrading delicate tangential feature learning. We argue that magnitude and direction play distinct roles and should be decoupled in optimizer dynamics.

We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals.

This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks.

A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain.

Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies.

Although many existing fault classification studies rely solely on direct fault labels, the aforementioned signals naturally embed additional information shaped by other physically coupled information. Herein, we leverage this coupling through a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly learns fault conditions and the related physical variables. Among MTL architectures, crosstalk structures have distinct advantages because they allow for controlled information exchange between tasks through the cross-talk layer while preventing negative transfer, in contrast to shared trunk architectures that often mix incompatible features. We build on our previously introduced residual neural dimension reductor model, and extend its application to two benchmarks where physical coupling is prominent. The first benchmark is a drone fault dataset, in which machine type and maneuvering direction significantly alter the frequency components of measured signals even under the same nominal condition. By learning fault classification together with these physical attributes, the cross-talk architecture can better classify faults. The second benchmark dataset is the motor compound fault dataset.

Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families. Across these settings, CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u8fbe\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u7684CoSA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6838\u5fc3\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u572810\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c5\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7SOTA\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982LoRA\u548cPiSSA\u4f9d\u8d56\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u914d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u5bf9\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u4f4e\u79e9\u5047\u8bbe\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoSA\uff08Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\u5c06\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6838\u5fc3\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f4\u63a5\u7ea6\u675f\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528RoBERTa\u3001Llama\u3001Qwen\u7b495\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCoSA\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CoSA\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u4f4e\u79e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This position paper argues that capability control -- imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior -- should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. While alignment is often context and preference-driven, capability control aims to impose hard operational limits on permissible behaviors, including under adversarial elicitation. We organize capability control mechanisms across the model lifecycle into three layers: (i) data-based control of the training distribution, (ii) learning-based control via weight- or representation-level interventions, and (iii) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails over inputs, outputs, and actions. Because each layer has characteristic failure modes when used in isolation, we advocate for a defense-in-depth approach that composes complementary controls across the full stack.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints.

However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEBPO\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3GRPO\u7684\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6536\u7f29\u878d\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u5df2\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46GRPO\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u5173\u952e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u5c0f\u7ec4\u89c4\u6a21\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5168\u90e8\u5931\u8d25\u573a\u666f\uff08\u6240\u6709\u54cd\u5e94\u96f6\u5956\u52b1\uff09\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316(EBPO)\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6536\u7f29\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec4\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5229\u7528Welford\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u65b0\u5168\u5c40\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIME\u548cOlympiadBench\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cEBPO\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8eGRPO\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c0f\u7ec4\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u53d7\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "EBPO\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5168\u5c40\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e2d\u501f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86GRPO\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684MSE\u548c\u975e\u6d88\u5931\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Seasonal models offer coarse forecasts that miss the fine-scale variability needed for daily, responsive ecosystem management. We present study that compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Medformer (Medical Transformer), Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). We trained our models with twelve years of daily hindcast data from 2009-2020 Our training data consists of 2009-2020 hindcast data from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(SAE)\u4e0eLLM\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u538b\u5916\u4ea4\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u6790\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Meta-Autointerp\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06SAE\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u7c7b\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u867d\u713690%\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u65e0\u76ca\uff0c\u800c\u90e8\u5206\u5b50\u96c6\u80fd\u4f7f\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534714.2%\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4f7f\u5f97\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u786e\u4fdd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5168\u538b\u5916\u4ea4\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(SAE)\u548cLLM\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faMeta-Autointerp\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06SAE\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u7c7b\u4e3a\u5173\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u9000\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u5c42\u6218\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5b9a\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a90%\u7684SAE\u5143\u7279\u5f81\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51fa\u4eba\u610f\u6599\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4e24\u9879\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u770b\u4f3c\u6709\u8da3\u7684SAE\u7279\u5f81\u548cLLM\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u800c\u8a00\u4e5f\u6bd4\u65e0\u7528\u66f4\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u90e8\u5206\u5b50\u96c6\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u672a\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u5347\u4e86+14.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "SAE\u4e0eLLM\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8d77\u70b9\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming.

Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDouble-P\u5206\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c07\u7ea7\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6top-p\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94token\u7ea7\u7cbe\u4fee\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500", "motivation": "\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u56e0\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u589e\u957f\u6210\u4e3a\u89e3\u7801\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u73b0\u6709top-p\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u5c0f\u52a0\u6743\u8d28\u5fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u7c07\u7ea7\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6top-p\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b2) \u4ec5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ea7top-p\u8fdb\u884ctoken\u7ea7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7cbe\u4fee", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4e4e\u96f6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u8fdb\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e1.8\u500d\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89e3\u7801\u52a0\u901f1.3\u500d", "conclusion": "Double-P\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e09\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications.

Accepted in Artificial Intelligence in Modeling and Simulation, Philippe J. Giabbanelli and Istvan David (eds). Series on Simulation Foundations, Methods and Applications. Springer, Cham. Series ISSN: 2195-2817", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information.

The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions.

Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem.

Accepted at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Linear attention methods offer Transformers $O(N)$ complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention. We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals.

This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large.

However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering.

However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies.

However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse.

As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude.

Despite their popularity, existing analyses for these algorithms are disparate, relying on different proof techniques tailored to each method. Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling.

In this work, we study the problem of synthesizing \\emph{robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates} that maintain their guarantees under perturbations in system dynamics. We formally define a robust Lyapunov barrier function and specify sufficient conditions based on Lipschitz continuity that ensure robustness against bounded perturbations. We propose practical training objectives that enforce these conditions via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization. We validate our approach in two practically relevant environments, Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking. The former is a widely studied benchmark, while the latter is a safety-critical task in autonomous systems.

While diffusion and flow-matching models are capable of modeling complex, multi-modal trajectories, their deployment in real-time streaming environments typically relies on repeated sampling from a non-informative initial distribution, incurring substantial inference latency and potential system backlogs. In this work, we introduce Sequential Flow Matching, a principled framework grounded in Bayesian filtering. By treating streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, our approach naturally aligns with the recursive structure of Bayesian belief updates. We provide theoretical justification that initializing generation from the previous posterior offers a principled warm start that can accelerate sampling compared to na\u00efve re-sampling. Across a wide range of forecasting, decision-making and state estimation tasks, our method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, therefore with faster sampling. It suggests that framing sequential inference via Bayesian filtering provides a new and principled perspective towards efficient real-time deployment of flow-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSequential Flow Matching\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4e0e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u524d\u4e00\u65f6\u523b\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d41\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u6837", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5728\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d41\u5f0f\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u53cd\u590d\u4ece\u975e\u4fe1\u606f\u521d\u59cb\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u79ef\u538b\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6d41\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u6982\u7387\u6d41\u6765\u4f20\u9012\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7528\u4e0a\u4e00\u65f6\u523b\u540e\u9a8c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u65f6\u523b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\"\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\"\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSequential Flow Matching\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u97001\u6b21\u6216\u6781\u5c11\u6570\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6b65\u6570\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6ee4\u6ce2\u89d2\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f0f\u90e8\u7f72\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861"}}

Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to \"stitch\" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of GAS, demonstrating superior performance in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b50\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u62fc\u63a5\u548c\u5956\u52b1-\u6210\u672c\u5e73\u8861\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGoal-Assisted Stitching (GAS)\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u79fb\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u91cd\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u53ef\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\uff0cGAS\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u7684OSRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ece\u5b50\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\"\u62fc\u63a5\"\u6700\u4f18\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "GAS\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65b9\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\uff1a(1)\u5728\u8f6c\u79fb\u7ea7\u522b\u589e\u5f3a\u5e76\u91cd\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u5b50\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b(2)\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u53ef\u8fbe\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6210\u672c\u76ee\u6807\uff1b(3)\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b(4)\u91cd\u5851\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1GAS\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GAS\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u62fc\u63a5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL. These properties yield a new theoretical perspective on pool-based AL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u6c60\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6807\u7b7e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e0e\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6c60\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6839\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8fb9\u754c", "method": "\u5c06\u6c60\u89c2\u6d4b\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u542b\u566a\u7b26\u53f7\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c6\u4e3a\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5757\u957f\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e-\u4efb\u52a1\u5931\u914d\u9879\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8be5\u754c\u9650\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u754c\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6c60\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6c60\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u754c\u9650\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u5339\u914d\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1"}}

Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN.

We analyze this node-level optimization and, for a backtracking line-search variant, prove that the local objective decreases monotonically and converges; in practice, both fixed and adaptive damping yield fast, stable convergence and can be combined with optional ridge regularization.

Accepted to AI4TS Workshop @ AAAI'26 as an oral presentation (see https://ai4ts.github.io/aaai2026)", "summary": "Time-series foundation models have emerged as a new paradigm for forecasting, yet their ability to effectively leverage exogenous features -- critical for electricity demand forecasting -- remains unclear. This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons.

However, the distributed nature of this approach still raises privacy and security issues, such as the exposure of sensitive data due to inference attacks and the influence of Byzantine behaviors on the trained model. In particular, achieving both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience remains challenging, as existing solutions often address these aspects independently. In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Propose a federated learning framework combining homomorphic encryption with meta-classifiers to simultaneously achieve privacy-preserving aggregation and Byzantine resilience, achieving 90-94% attack detection accuracy with minimal utility loss.", "motivation": "Federated Learning faces dual challenges of privacy leakage from inference attacks and model poisoning from Byzantine participants.

However, existing LLM reranking methods either rely on heuristics that fail to fully exploit the information revealed by each ranking decision or are inefficient when they do. We introduce a tournament graph framework that provides a principled foundation for $k$-wise reranking. Our key observation is that each $k$-document comparison reveals a complete tournament of $\\binom{k}{2}$ pairwise preferences. These tournaments are aggregated into a global preference graph, whose transitive closure yields many additional orderings without further model invocations. We formalize when a candidate's rank is certifiably determined and design a query schedule that greedily maximizes information gain towards identifying the top-$m$ items. Our framework also gracefully handles non-transitive preferences - cycles induced by LLM judgments - by collapsing them into equivalence classes that yield principled tiered rankings.

However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\\approx$ 20\\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity.

To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6bcf\u7126\u8033\u6bd4\u7279\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u2014\u2014\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u7387\u4e0e\u8d4b\u80fd\u7387\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u80fd\u91cf-\u667a\u80fd\u6548\u7387\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u80fd\u529b\u5353\u8d8a\u4f46\u80fd\u8017\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u6548\u7387\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u4f18\u5316AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1a(1) \u6bcf\u7126\u8033\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u7387\u2014\u2014\u5355\u4f4d\u80fd\u8017\u5185\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u73af\u5883\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff1b(2) \u6bcf\u7126\u8033\u8d4b\u80fd\u7387\u2014\u2014\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8fd0\u52a8\u901a\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u80fd\u8017\u4e4b\u6bd4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u91cd\u7f6e\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faLandauer\u5c3a\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u660e\u786e\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u7684Landauer\u5c3a\u5ea6\u95ed\u5408\u5faa\u73af\u57fa\u51c6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684\u63a8\u8bba\uff1b\u9610\u660eLandauer\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6210\u672c\u5728\u95ed\u5408\u5faa\u73af\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u82e5\u65e0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u4e14\u4e0d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5916\u90e8\u4f4e\u71b5\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u8017\u6563\u65e0\u9700\u7d27\u5bc6\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u754cMDL\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6548\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u62a5\u544a\u4e24\u4e2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u8fb9\u754c/\u80fd\u91cf\u6838\u7b97\u3001\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6/\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4/\u91cd\u7f6e\u7b49\u6700\u5c0f\u68c0\u67e5\u6e05\u5355\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6b67\u4e49\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6bcf\u7126\u8033\u6bd4\u7279\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52fe\u52d2\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u7f29\u653e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002"}}

The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods.

Code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/EUQ", "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \\emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

Existing methods primarily target resolving conflicts between task updates, leaving the failure mode of over-counting shared knowledge unaddressed. We show that when tasks share aligned spectral directions (i.e., overlapping singular vectors), a simple linear combination repeatedly accumulates these directions, inflating the singular values and biasing the merged model toward shared subspaces. To mitigate this issue, we propose Singular Value Calibration (SVC), a training-free and data-free post-processing method that quantifies subspace overlap and rescales inflated singular values to restore a balanced spectrum. Across vision and language benchmarks, SVC consistently improves strong merging baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by modifying only the singular values, SVC improves the performance of Task Arithmetic by 13.0%.

Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, FlowSteer demonstrates strong task performance and token efficiency compared to leading inference-time baselines.

However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones.

Existing domain generalization methods rely on fixed structural augmentations or training on globally perturbed graphs, mechanisms that do not pinpoint which specific edges encode domain-invariant information. We argue that domain-invariant structural information is not rigidly tied to a single topology but resides in the consensus across multiple graph structures derived from topology and feature similarity. To capture this, we first propose EdgeMask-DG, a novel min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns to find worst-case continuous masks subject to a sparsity constraint, compelling a task GNN to perform effectively under these adversarial structural perturbations. Building upon this, we introduce EdgeMask-DG*, an extension that applies this adversarial masking principle to an enriched graph. This enriched graph combines the original topology with feature-derived edges, allowing the model to discover invariances even when the original topology is noisy or domain-specific. EdgeMask-DG* is the first to systematically combine adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs. We provide a formal justification for our approach from a robust optimization perspective. We demonstrate that EdgeMask-DG* achieves new state-of-the-art performance on diverse graph domain generalization benchmarks, including citation networks, social networks, and temporal graphs. Notably, on the Cora OOD benchmark, EdgeMask-DG* lifts the worst-case domain accuracy to 78.0\\%, a +3.8 pp improvement over the prior state of the art (74.2\\%).

We propose \\emph{Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM)}, the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, which enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps. PGFM conducts flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution. Particularly, we develop a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, which allows trajectories to reliably land on assigned prototypes while preserving diversity and efficiency. Extensive experiments across high-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches with fewer steps of sampling while delivering competitive performance with remarkably improved efficiency, e.g., 7.6$\\times$ more efficient than the diffusion-based counterparts with 78\\% mode coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5bfc\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08PGFM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u66ff\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6b65ODE\u6c42\u89e3\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u6216\u539f\u578b\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u8017\u65f6\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f3a\u63a7\u5236\u6216\u4f4eIPC\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d", "method": "1) \u5728\u51bb\u7ed3VAE\u7684\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b2) \u5f00\u53d1\u8fde\u7eed\u8def\u5f84\u5230\u539f\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0ODE\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u9760\u843d\u70b9\u81f3\u6307\u5b9a\u539f\u578b", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u6570\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53477.6\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630178%\u6a21\u5f0f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "PGFM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5408\u6210\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6848"}}

Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively.

Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains.

Theoretical analysis of behavioral alignment evaluation", "summary": "Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.\n  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.\n  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.\n  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u6cd5\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\"\u5bf9\u9f50\"\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5408\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u7531\u6b64\u65ad\u5b9a\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u884c\u4e3a\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5316\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\"\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\"\u548c\"\u89c4\u8303\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u523b\u753b\u4e0d\u540c\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u5b9a\u7406\uff1a\u5728\u6709\u9650\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u611f\u77e5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u4e0d\u80fd\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u6027\u5730\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u884c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ea\u80fd\u7f29\u5c0f\u517c\u5bb9\u5047\u8bbe\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u5176\u574d\u7f29\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e94\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7279\u5b9a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u5236\u4e0b\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u5e95\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8981\u6c42\u9886\u57df\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \\in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{\u03b2_p}/\\log(t)}$, where $\u03b2_p = \\frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \\in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{\u03b2_p/2}}$, $p \\in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76SGD\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u4ee3\u4ef7\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff0cSGD\u548c\u88c1\u526aSGD\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u4e3ae^(-t/log(t))\u548ce^(-t^\u03b2_p/log(t))\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u9650(e^(-\u221at)\u7b49)\u5feb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e0b\u754ce^(-t)\u7684\u7d27\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8SGD\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff08\u56fa\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bef\u5dee\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\u6982\u7387\uff08\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u7387\uff09\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u591a\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\uff09\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u957f\u671f\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8eSGD\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "1) \u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u51f8\u4ee3\u4ef7\u548c\u6709\u754c\u566a\u58f0\uff0cvanilla SGD\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8fed\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u5e73\u65b9\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e0a\u754c\u5177\u6709e^(-t/log(t))\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8870\u51cf\u7387\uff1b2) \u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u754cp\u9636\u77e9(p\u2208(1,2])\u7684\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\uff0cc-SGD\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e0a\u754c\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u4e3ae^(-t^\u03b2_p/log(t))\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u03b2_p = 4(p-1)/(3p-2)\uff0c\u5f53p=2\u65f6\u4e3ae^(-t/log\u00b2(t))\uff1b3) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u4e0b\u754ce^(-t)\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u901f\u7387\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u610f\u4e49\u4e0b\u662f\u7d27\u7684\uff1b4) \u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u9650(e^(-\u221at)\u548ce^(-t^(\u03b2_p/2)))\uff0c\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5feb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86SGD\u548cc-SGD\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5c3e\u90e8\u8870\u51cf\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u8ba4\u77e5\u5feb\u5f97\u591a\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k).

Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity.

Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPBP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u878d\u5165POMDP\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPOMDP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08\u5982\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u611f\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51faPerception-based Beliefs for POMDPs (PBP)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2. \u5c06\u5206\u5e03\u76f4\u63a5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6821\u51c6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bef\u5dee\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u504f\u5dee", "result": "1. \u5728\u6807\u51c6POMDP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0PBP\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "PBP\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6865\u63a5\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5316\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89c6\u89c9POMDP\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

Additionally, the activation function can significantly alter the implicit inductive bias of the architecture, controlling its non-linear behavior. In this paper, in line with previous work, we argue that evolutionary search provides a useful framework for finding new activation functions, while we also make two novel observations. The first is that modern pipelines, such as AlphaEvolve, which relies on frontier LLMs as a mutator operator, allows for a much wider and flexible search space; e.g., over all possible python functions within a certain FLOP budget, eliminating the need for manually constructed search spaces. In addition, these pipelines will be biased towards meaningful activation functions, given their ability to represent common knowledge, leading to a potentially more efficient search of the space. The second observation is that, through this framework, one can target not only performance improvements but also activation functions that encode particular inductive biases. This can be done by using performance on out-of-distribution data as a fitness function, reflecting the degree to which the architecture respects the inherent structure in the data in a manner independent of distribution shifts. We carry an empirical exploration of this proposal and show that relatively small scale synthetic datasets can be sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activations.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper uses evolutionary search with LLMs (AlphaEvolve) to automatically discover activation functions, showing it can explore a much larger space of Python functions and find those with specific inductive biases by using out-of-distribution performance as the fitness metric.", "motivation": "Activation functions significantly impact optimization, expressivity, and inductive bias, but current research relies on manually constructed search spaces; there's a need for automated discovery of functions that encode desired biases for better generalization.", "method": "Proposes using evolutionary search frameworks like AlphaEvolve with frontier LLMs as mutators to explore vast Python function spaces within FLOP budgets, using out-of-distribution performance as fitness to bias toward specific inductive biases.", "result": "Empirical exploration shows that small synthetic datasets are sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activation functions that improve performance and encode targeted inductive biases.", "conclusion": "Evolutionary search with LLMs provides an efficient, automated framework for discovering novel activation functions that can explore larger search spaces and be guided to encode specific inductive biases beyond mere performance metrics."}}

Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem.

In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering.

However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6709\u754c\u641c\u7d22\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8bbf\u95ee\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u820d\u5165\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d2\u503c\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0e\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u81ea\u7136\u878d\u5408\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u9010\u6b21\u820d\u5165\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u754c\u641c\u7d22\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f\u5e73\u8861\u91cf\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u4f4d\u5bbd\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebfPTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f\u9002\u5ea6\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6709\u754c\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, shifting across tasks often introduces a context mismatch. Hence, existing approaches either discard the trajectories or manipulate them using heuristics, leading to a non-negligible fine-tuning cost or unguaranteed performance. To bridge this gap, we reveal a context-trajectory correlation, where shifts of context are highly parallel with shifts of trajectory. Based on this finding, we propose BrIdge contextual gap FoR imprOvised trajectory STeering (Bifrost), a training-free method that leverages context differences to precisely guide the adaptation of previously solved trajectories towards the target task, mitigating the misalignment caused by context shifts. Our trajectory adaptation is conducted at the representation level using agent hidden states, ensuring trajectory transformation accurately aligns with the target context in a shared space.

Code, datasets, and models are available at https://github.com/szegedai/world-model-verification", "summary": "Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods.

A lot of research has been done in leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation. However, the resulting models are either not accurate enough or are still vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA) or dataset reconstruction attacks since the original data has been leveraged in the training process. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of producing a synthetic test dataset with the same statistical properties as the original one, with only indirectly leveraging the original data in the generation process. The approach is inspired by GANs, with a generation step and a discrimination step. However, in our approach, we use a test generator (a fuzzer) to produce test data from an input specification, preserving constraints set by the original data; a discriminator model determines how close we are to the original data. By evolving samples and determining \"good samples\" with the discriminator, we can generate privacy-preserving data that follows the same statistical distributions are the original dataset, leading to a similar utility as the original data. We evaluated our approach on four datasets that have been used to evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques.

We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose \"Diamond Maps\", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function.

First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \\citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \\ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \\citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting.

While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference.

We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control.

Submitted to Mathematical Programming", "summary": "Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization.

Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "DFPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ef7\u503c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u76d1\u7763\u548cOOD\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u4e34\u566a\u58f0\u76d1\u7763\u548cOOD\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ef7\u503c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548cOOD\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDFPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4ef7\u503c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u573a\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6cbf\u4ef7\u503c\u6d41\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cDFPO\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8ePPO\u3001FlowRL\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "DFPO\u901a\u8fc7\u4ef7\u503c\u6d41\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce ContextBench, a process-oriented evaluation of context retrieval in coding agents. ContextBench consists of 1,136 issue-resolution tasks from 66 repositories across eight programming languages, each augmented with human-annotated gold contexts. We further implement an automated evaluation framework that tracks agent trajectories and measures context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution. Using ContextBench, we evaluate four frontier LLMs and five coding agents. Our results show that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval (\"The Bitter Lesson\" of coding agents), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process.

While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$\u03c7^2$ regularizer.

However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging.

Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers.

Hydraulic cylinders, as actuators in these systems, apply force and position through the displacement of hydraulic fluid, but their operation is significantly influenced by friction force. Achieving precision in hydraulic cylinders requires an accurate friction model under various operating conditions. Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation. The algorithm effectively combines feature detection and estimation processes using training data acquired from an experimental hydraulic test setup. It achieves a consistent and stable model error of less than 10% across diverse operating conditions and external load variations, ensuring robust performance in complex situations. The computational cost of the algorithm is 1.51 milliseconds per estimation, making it suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method addresses the limitations of analytical models by delivering high precision and computational efficiency. The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model. The comparison highlights that while the LuGre model offers a theoretical foundation for friction modeling, its performance is limited by its inability to dynamically adjust to varying operational conditions of the hydraulic cylinder, further emphasizing the advantages of the proposed hybrid approach in real-time applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLSTM\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6db2\u538b\u7f38\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8bef\u5dee<10%\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8017\u65f61.51\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eLuGre\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u6db2\u538b\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u63a7\u5236\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684LSTM-\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5de5\u51b5\u53ca\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f4e\u4e8e10%\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u4f30\u8ba1\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f41.51\u6beb\u79d2\uff1b\u8f83LuGre\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6db2\u538b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

Empirically, AP-OOD sets a new state of the art in OOD detection for text: in the unsupervised setting, it reduces the FPR95 (false positive rate at 95% true positives) from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM summarization, and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAP-OOD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528token\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884cOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u7a81\u51fa", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684token\u5d4c\u5165\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528token\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u8f85\u52a9\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAP-OOD\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528token\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u95f4\u7075\u6d3b\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u8f85\u52a9\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cXSUM\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1FPR95\u4ece27.84%\u964d\u81f34.67%\uff0cWMT15\u82f1\u8bd1\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u4ece77.08%\u964d\u81f370.37%\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6587\u672cOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0SOTA", "conclusion": "AP-OOD\u901a\u8fc7token\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672cOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72ML\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848"}}

Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions. We find that models trained on one task do not reliably generalize to related tasks, even if the tasks share visual statistics and physical principles, and regardless of whether the models are trained through interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u65e2\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u76f4\u89c9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5173\u952e", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff09", "result": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bad\u7ec3\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u5f53\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u89c6\u89c9/\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u73b0\u8c61\u5747\u5b58\u5728", "conclusion": "\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c9\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\"\u4ea4\u4e92\u5fc5\u7136\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u5b66\u4e60\"\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027"}}
