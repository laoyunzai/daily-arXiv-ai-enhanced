[KKMP21] observed that many of the natural problems considered so far in the second level of the total function polynomial hierarchy (TF$Σ_2$) reduce to the Strong Avoid problem. In this work, we prove that the Linear Ordering Principle does not reduce to Strong Avoid in the black-box setting, exhibiting the first TF$Σ_2$ problem that lies outside of the class of problems reducible to Strong Avoid.\n  The proof of our separation exploits a connection between total search problems in the polynomial hierarchy and proof complexity, recently developed by Fleming, Imrek, and Marciot [FIM25]. In particular, this implies that to show our separation, it suffices to show that there is no small proof of the Linear Ordering Principle in a $Σ_2$-variant of the Sherali-Adams proof system. To do so, we extend the classical pseudo-expectation method to the $Σ_2$ setting, showing that the existence of a $Σ_2$ pseudo-expectation precludes a $Σ_2$ Sherali-Adams proof. The main technical challenge is in proving the existence of such a pseudo-expectation, we manage to do so by solving a combinatorial covering problem about permutations. We also show that the extended pseudo-expectation bound implies that the Linear Ordering Principle cannot be reduced to any problem admitting a low-degree Sherali-Adams refutation."}

Vega"], "title": "A Generalization of the Parametric Amplifier with Dunkl Derivative: Spectral and Statistical Properties", "comment": "17 pages", "summary": "We study the parametric amplifier Hamiltonian within the framework of the Dunkl formalism. We introduce the Dunkl creation and annihilation operators and show that their quadratic combinations generate an $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. The spectral problem is solved exactly using two algebraic methods: the $su(1,1)$ tilting transformation and the generalized Bogoliubov transformation. The exact energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions are obtained in terms of the Dunkl number coherent states. Furthermore, we compute the Mandel $Q$ parameter and the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ to analyze the statistical properties of the Dunkl squeezed states. We show that, for the squeezed vacuum, the Mandel parameter remains independent of the Dunkl deformation, whereas the correlation function exhibits an explicit dependence on the Dunkl parameter $μ$, which modifies the photon bunching effects. Finally, we show that our results reduce to the standard parametric amplifier case in the limit of vanishing Dunkl deformation parameter."}

Submitted to Acta Astronautica", "summary": "Dynamical structures in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) are fundamental for designing low-energy transfers, as they aid in analyzing phase space transport and designing desirable trajectories. This study focuses on lobe dynamics to exploit local chaotic transport around celestial bodies, and proposes a new method for systematically designing low-energy transfers by combining multiple lobe dynamics. A graph-based framework is constructed to explore possible transfer paths between departure and arrival orbits, reducing the complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem for designing fuel-efficient transfers. Based on this graph, low-energy transfer trajectories are constructed by connecting chaotic orbits within lobes. The resulting optimal trajectory in the Earth--Moon CR3BP is then converted into an optimal transfer in the bicircular restricted four-body problem using multiple shooting. The obtained transfer is compared with existing optimal solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

We identify the transformations of the auxiliary (commuting and anticommuting) variables that ensure covariance under such transformations. The subtleties induced by the non-differentiable trajectories of the stochastic dynamics are encoded in the fermionic statistics. Upon integrating out the auxiliary variables, we derive the Onsager-Machlup formulation, which agrees with the one recently obtained using a higher-order discretization scheme. In contrast to the latter, the construction proposed here is formulated directly in continuous time."}

Unlike curriculum learning approaches that require predefined difficulty metrics or hard example mining methods that demand expensive per-sample loss tracking, PBS employs a lightweight linear predictor trained online to estimate sample difficulty from static token-level features. Our predictor achieves 0.44 correlation with actual loss using only four simple features: token frequency, sequence length, vocabulary diversity, and rare token ratio. Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer demonstrate that PBS achieves 6-13\\% faster convergence measured by evaluation loss across training checkpoints, with the predictor's correlation improving from 0.14 to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps. These results validate that token frequency statistics encode meaningful information about sample difficulty, enabling effective curriculum learning with negligible computational overhead."}

Here, we present a complete framework for the fault-tolerant preparation of arbitrary logical states encoded in the four-legged cat code. This framework is engineered to suppress the dominant incoherent errors, including excitation decay and dephasing in both the bosonic mode and the ancilla via error detection. Numerical simulations with experimentally realistic parameters on a 3D superconducting cavity platform yield logical infidelities on the order of $10^{-4}$. A scaling analysis confirms that the logical error rate grows nearly quadratically with the physical error rate, confirming that all first-order errors are fully suppressed. Our protocol is compatible with current hardware and is scalable to multiple bosonic modes, providing a resource-efficient foundation for magic state preparation and higher-level concatenated quantum error correction."}
