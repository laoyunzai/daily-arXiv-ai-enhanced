The thermalization appears due to a variety of interactions between countries with conservation of two integrals being total GDP and probability (norm). In such a case there is an emergence of Rayleigh-Jeans condensation at states with low GDP. This phenomenon has been studied theoretically and experimentally in multimode optical fibers and we argue that it is at the origin of emergence of poverty and oligarchic phases for GDP of countries. A similar phenomenon has been discussed recently in the framework of the Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis to explain the high inequality of wealth distribution in human society and companies at Stock Exchange markets. We show that the Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization well describes the GDP distribution during the last 50 years."}

For such nonlocal dynamics, the free energy admits a full dissipation formula that decomposes into entropy production and housekeeping heat. A central result is a decomposition of the generator into symmetric and anti-symmetric parts with respect to the invariant measure $ρ_{ss}$. The symmetric sector corresponds to a reversible dynamics and yields a nonlocal Fisher information governing free-energy decay, whereas the anti-symmetric sector generates a canonical conservative flow that produces circulation but no dissipation. Several numerical examples demonstrate how this decomposition clarifies the structure of nonequilibrium stationary states in jump-driven systems."}

In this paper, we ground this capacity functionally in the generative process of intrinsic dynamics, characterized as a self-referential loop generated by internal coarse-graining and downward causation. This process allows the system to autonomously compress microscopic states into macroscopic variables that subsequently constrain microscopic temporal evolution. By distinguishing the intrinsic dynamics of the system from the external coarse-graining of an observer's interpretation, we define agency through the dynamics of the predictive gap. This gap constitutes the internal divergence between the system's anticipation and its realization, as well as the limited reducibility of the system's generated constraints within the observer's interpretive model. This framework outlines a spectrum of agency that distinguishes biological systems, whose teleological constraints are generated through their own regulatory dynamics, from artificial systems, whose organization is designed to satisfy externally specified objectives. Finally, we extend this interface to the social domain, proposing that these generative divergences underpin participatory sense-making and emergent coordination."}

Pilot study. Data, prompts, and code available at https://osf.io/dc24t/", "summary": "Large language models are increasingly used to evaluate other models, yet these judgments typically lack any representation of confidence. This pilot study tests whether framing an evaluation task as a betting game (a fictional prediction market with its own LLM currency) improves forecasting accuracy and surfaces calibrated confidence signals. We generated 100 math and logic questions with verifiable answers. Six Baseline models (three current-generation, three prior-generation) answered all items. Three Predictor models then forecasted, for each question-baseline pair, if the baseline would answer correctly. Each predictor completed matched runs in two conditions: Control (simple correct/incorrect predictions) and Incentive (predictions plus wagers of 1-100,000 LLMCoin under even odds, starting from a 1,000,000 LLMCoin bankroll). Across 5,400 predictions per condition, Incentive runs showed modestly higher accuracy (81.5% vs. 79.1%, p = .089, d = 0.86) and significantly faster learning across rounds (12.0 vs. 2.9 percentage-point improvement from Round 1 to Round 4, p = .011). Most notably, stake size tracked confidence. \"Whale\" bets of 40,000+ coins were correct ~99% of the time, while small bets (<1,000 coins) showed only ~74% accuracy. The key finding is not that fictional money makes models smarter; accuracy gains were modest and did not reach statistical significance (p = .089) in this pilot. Rather, the betting mechanic created a legible confidence signal absent from binary yes/no outputs. This suggests that simple financial framing may help transform LLMs into risk-aware forecasters, making their internal beliefs visible and usable. The protocol offers a foundation for future work for meta-evaluation systems and what may become LLM-to-LLM prediction markets."}

While systematic analysis reveals key design principles, such as field-induced localization for trapping the mobile hole, it becomes computationally intractable for optimization. We show that an autonomous RL agent, benchmarked across five 3D lattices from tetrahedron to FCC, achieves human-competitive accuracy (R^2 > 0.97) and 95.5 percent success on held-out tasks.

We show that the single-species model features a random mass term, or equivalently a random space-time averaged growth rate, poising some species very close to extinction. This introduces a hierarchy of ever larger correlation times and lengths as the extinction threshold is approached. In turn, every species, even those far from extinction, are coupled to these near-critical fields which combine to make fluctuations of population sizes generically scale-free. We argue that these correlations are described by exponents derived from those of directed percolation in spatial dimension $d=3$, but not in lower dimensions."}

Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in automating ASD diagnosis, but most existing models operate as black boxes and are typically trained on a single dataset, limiting their generalizability. In this study, we introduce a transparent and interpretable ML approach that leverages BioBERT, a state-of-the-art language model, to analyze unstructured clinical text. The model is trained to label descriptions of behaviors and map them to diagnostic criteria, which are then used to assign a final label (ASD or not). We evaluate transfer learning, the ability to transfer knowledge to new data, using two distinct real-world datasets. We trained on datasets sequentially and mixed together and compared the performance of the best models and their ability to transfer to new data. We also created a black-box approach and repeated this transfer process for comparison. Our transparent model demonstrated robust performance, with the mixed-data training strategy yielding the best results (97 % sensitivity, 98 % specificity). Sequential training across datasets led to a slight drop in performance, highlighting the importance of training data order. The black-box model performed worse (90 % sensitivity, 96 % specificity) when trained sequentially or with mixed data. Overall, our transparent approach outperformed the black-box approach. Mixing datasets during training resulted in slightly better performance and should be the preferred approach when practically possible. This work paves the way for more trustworthy, generalizable, and clinically actionable AI tools in neurodevelopmental diagnostics."}

In this theoretical work, we propose \\textbf{Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI)}, a formal framework rooted in algebraic topology that unifies learning and memory as phase transitions of a single geometric substrate. Central to our theory is the \\textbf{Homological Parity Principle}, which posits a fundamental dichotomy: even-dimensional homology ($H_{even}$) physically instantiates stable \\textbf{Content} (stable scaffolds or ``what''), while odd-dimensional homology ($H_{odd}$) instantiates dynamic \\textbf{Context} (dynamic flows or ``where''). We derive the logical flow of MAI as a topological trinity transformation: \\textbf{Search $\\to$ Closure $\\to$ Structure}. Specifically, we demonstrate that cognition operates by converting high-complexity recursive search (modeled by \\textit{Savitch's Theorem} in NPSPACE) into low-complexity lookup (modeled by \\textit{Dynamic Programming} in P) via the mechanism of \\textbf{Topological Cycle Closure}. We further show that this consolidation process is governed by a topological generalization of the Wake-Sleep algorithm, functioning as a coordinate descent that alternates between optimizing the $H_{odd}$ flow (inference/wake) and condensing persistent cycles into the $H_{even}$ scaffold (learning/sleep). This framework offers a rigorous explanation for the emergence of fast-thinking (intuition) from slow-thinking (reasoning) and provides a blueprint for post-Turing architectures that compute via topological resonance."}

In this architecture, the workflow manager enforces reproducibility and determinism, while the agent autonomously generates, executes, and iteratively corrects analysis code in response to user instructions. We define quantitative evaluation metrics including success rate, error distribution, costs per specific task, and average number of API calls, to assess agent performance across multi-stage workflows. To characterize variability across architectures, we benchmark a representative selection of state-of-the-art LLMs spanning the Gemini and GPT-5 series, the Claude family, and leading open-weight models. While the workflow manager ensures deterministic execution of all analysis steps, the final outputs still show stochastic variation.

Effective alignment in such settings requires reward models that are interpretable so that stakeholders can understand and audit model objectives. Moreover, reward models must be capable of steering agents at interaction time, allowing preference shifts to be incorporated without retraining. We introduce ARCANE, a framework that frames alignment as a multi-agent collaboration problem that dynamically represents stakeholder preferences as natural-language rubrics: weighted sets of verifiable criteria that can be generated on-the-fly from task context. Inspired by utility theory, we formulate rubric learning as a reconstruction problem and apply a regularized Group-Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) procedure that balances interpretability, faithfulness, and computational efficiency. Using a corpus of 219 labeled rubrics derived from the GDPVal benchmark, we evaluate ARCANE on challenging tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and tool use. The learned rubrics produce compact, legible evaluations and enable configurable trade-offs (e.g., correctness vs. conciseness) without retraining. Our results show that rubric-based reward models offer a promising path toward interpretable, test-time adaptive alignment for complex, long-horizon AI systems."}

To further increase the amount of spectra and their diversity in term of VOC concentration, we augment the experimental dataset with synthetic spectra created via conditional generative NNs. This allows us to train robust discriminative NNs, able to reliably identify the nine VOCs, as well as to precisely predict their concentrations. The trained NN is suitable to be incorporated into sensing devices for VOCs recognition and analysis."}

In experiments, velocity distributions are typically obtained by particle tracking, which however becomes limited at moderate and high particle densities. As a way forward, we propose a new technique for measuring particle velocities in situ by using a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor, which remains applicable at significantly higher particle densities.The FBG sensor detects strain pulses induced by particle-fiber collisions, from which the velocity of the impacting particle can be derived. Applying this method to an ensemble of granular particles allows to extract its velocity distributions as we present for a granular system excited by a vibrational shaker. We validate the extracted velocity distribution against conventional particle-tracking measurements, confirming the reliability of the FBG-based technique."}

Early NPD measurements on the monoclinic phase Cr$_3$Te$_4$ ($x=0.5$) presented evidence for competing FM and AFM phases. Here we apply neutron diffraction to a single crystal of Cr$_{3+δ}$Te$_4$ with $δ=-0.10$ and discover that it consists of two distinct monoclinic phases, one with FM order below $T_{\\rm C} \\approx 321$ K and another that develops AFM order below $T_{\\rm N} \\approx 86$ K. In contrast, we find that a crystal with $δ=-0.26$ exhibits only FM order. The single-crystal analysis is complemented by results obtained with NPD, XPD, and TEM measurements on the $δ=-0.10$ composition. From observations of spontaneous magnetostriction of opposite sign at $T_{\\rm C}$ and $T_{\\rm N}$, along with the TEM evidence for both monoclinic phases in a single thin ($\\approx$ 100 nm) grain, we conclude that the two phases must have a fine-grained ($\\lesssim$ 100 nm) intergrowth character, as might occur from high-temperature spinodal decomposition during the growth process. Calculations of the relaxed lattice structures for the FM and AFM phases with DFT provide a rationalization of the observed spontaneous magnetostrictions. Correlations between the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic moments with lattice parameter variation demonstrate that the magnetic orders are sensitive to strain, thus explaining why magnetic ordering temperatures and anisotropies can be different between bulk and thin-film samples, when the latter are subject to epitaxial strain. Our results point to the need to investigate the supposed coexistence FM and AFM phases reported elsewhere in the Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$ system, such as in the Cr$_5$Te$_8$ phase ($x=0.25$)."}

Studying unitaries and their generators from the Lie algebraic perspective has given rise to several algorithms for synthesis based on a Cartan decomposition of the dynamical Lie algebra. For unitaries of the form $e^{-itH}$, such as time-independent Hamiltonian simulation, the resulting circuits have depth that does not depend on simulation time $t$. However, finding such circuits has a large classical overhead in the cost function evaluation and the high dimensional optimization problem. In this work, by further partitioning the dynamical Lie algebra, we break down the optimization problem into smaller independent subproblems. Moreover, the resulting algebraic structure allows us to easily shift the evaluation of the cost function to the quantum computer, further cutting the classical overhead of the algorithm. As an application of the new hybrid algorithm, we synthesize the time evolution unitary for the 4-site transverse field Ising model on several IBM devices and Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum computer."}

It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition."}

We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition.

However, we demonstrate that such synthetic releases can still leak information about the underlying training samples through structural overlap in the data manifold. We propose a black-box membership inference attack that exploits this vulnerability without requiring access to model internals or real data. The attacker repeatedly queries the generative model to obtain large numbers of synthetic samples, performs unsupervised clustering to identify dense regions of the synthetic distribution, and then analyzes cluster medoids and neighborhoods that correspond to high-density regions in the original training data. These neighborhoods act as proxies for training samples, enabling the adversary to infer membership or reconstruct approximate records. Our experiments across healthcare, finance, and other sensitive domains show that cluster overlap between real and synthetic data leads to measurable membership leakage-even when the generator is trained with differential privacy or other noise mechanisms. The results highlight an under-explored attack surface in synthetic data generation pipelines and call for stronger privacy guarantees that account for distributional neighborhood inference rather than sample-level memorization alone, underscoring its role in privacy-preserving data publishing.

Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations.

Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation.

Toward reflecting both perspectives, we propose a novel evaluation framework (PROBE), which consists of a rank transformer (RT) estimating the score of each prediction based on a required level of predictive sharpness and a rank aggregator (RA) aggregating all the scores in a popularity-aware manner.

Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking.

However, the fully etched rings of conventional CBGs restrict the implementation of charge and Stark tuning via electrical contacts. To overcome this limitation, a labyrinth CBG geometry with four bridges has been proposed, yet the added bridges significantly degraded optical performance. In this work, we numerically demonstrate that a periodic labyrinth CBG design preserves both high coupling efficiency and strong Purcell enhancement while enabling electrical integration if optimized after introducing the bridges. We show three optimized designs at emission wavelengths of 780 nm, 930 nm, and 1550 nm, because these wavelengths are among the most relevant for quantum dots and show the general applicability of our approach. At all three wavelengths collection efficiencies exceeding 90% into a numerical aperture of 0.7 and Purcell factors greater than 25 are achieved. Furthermore, we propose a device layout incorporating a barrier layer that separates p- and n-doped semiconductor regions, which is incorporated to prevent tunneling of one of the charge carriers for selective charging. Also this design can be reoptimized to retain the performance of a device without tunnel barrier. These results establish labyrinth CBGs as a platform for electrically tunable quantum dot single-photon sources with high efficiency and scalability."}

While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for eliciting such post-training reasoning capabilities due to its exceptional performance, it remains plagued by significant training instability and poor sample efficiency. We theoretically identify the root cause of these issues as the lack of distinctiveness within on-policy rollouts: for routine queries, highly homogeneous samples induce destructive gradient conflicts; whereas for hard queries, the scarcity of valid positive samples results in ineffective optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose Distinctiveness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (DaGRPO). DaGRPO incorporates two core mechanisms: (1) Sequence-level Gradient Rectification, which utilizes fine-grained scoring to dynamically mask sample pairs with low distinctiveness, thereby eradicating gradient conflicts at the source; and (2) Off-policy Data Augmentation, which introduces high-quality anchors to recover training signals for challenging tasks. Extensive experiments across 9 mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization benchmarks demonstrate that DaGRPO significantly surpasses existing SFT, GRPO, and hybrid baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art performance (e.g., a +4.7% average accuracy gain on math benchmarks). Furthermore, in-depth analysis confirms that DaGRPO effectively mitigates gradient explosion and accelerates the emergence of long-chain reasoning capabilities."}

However, many U.S. DOTs struggle to obtain accurate AADT, especially for unmonitored roads. While continuous count (CC) stations offer accurate traffic volume data, their implementation is expensive and difficult to deploy widely, compelling agencies to rely on short-duration traffic counts. This study proposes a machine learning framework, the first to our knowledge, to identify optimal representative days for conducting short count (SC) data collection to improve AADT prediction accuracy. Using 2022 and 2023 traffic volume data from the state of Texas, we compare two scenarios: an 'optimal day' approach that iteratively selects the most informative days for AADT estimation and a 'no optimal day' baseline reflecting current practice by most DOTs. To align with Texas DOT's traffic monitoring program, continuous count data were utilized to simulate the 24 hour short counts. The actual field short counts were used to enhance feature engineering through using a leave-one-out (LOO) technique to generate unbiased representative daily traffic features across similar road segments. Our proposed methodology outperforms the baseline across the top five days, with the best day (Day 186) achieving lower errors (RMSE: 7,871.15, MAE: 3,645.09, MAPE: 11.95%) and higher R^2 (0.9756) than the baseline (RMSE: 11,185.00, MAE: 5,118.57, MAPE: 14.42%, R^2: 0.9499).

We show that the single-species model features a random mass term, or equivalently a random space-time averaged growth rate, poising some species very close to extinction. This introduces a hierarchy of ever larger correlation times and lengths as the extinction threshold is approached. In turn, every species, even those far from extinction, are coupled to these near-critical fields which combine to make fluctuations of population sizes generically scale-free.

Our study reveals that electron spin lattice relaxation is governed at lowest temperatures by phonon-bottlenecked process and at high temperature by the chain dimerization gap.

In DQC, after partitioning quantum circuits, they must be scheduled and executed on heterogenous QPUs while balancing latency, overhead, QPU communication resource limits. However, since fully functioning quantum communication networks have not been realized yet, near-term quantum clouds will only rely on local operations and classical communication settings between QPUs, without entangled quantum links. Additionally, existing DQC scheduling frameworks do not account for user-defined execution deadlines and adopt inefficient wire cutting techniques. Accordingly, in this work, a deadline aware DQC scheduling framework with efficient wire cutting for near-term quantum cloud is proposed. The proposed framework schedules partitioned quantum subcircuits while accounting for circuit deadlines and QPU capacity limits. It also captures dependencies between partitioned subcircuits and distributes the execution of the sampling shots on different QPUs to have efficient wire cutting and faster execution. In this regard, a deadline-aware circuit scheduling optimization problem is formulated, and solved using simulated annealing. Simulation results show a marked improvement over existing shot-agnostic frameworks under urgent deadlines, reaching a 12.8% increase in requests served before their deadlines. Additionally, the proposed framework serves 8.16% more requests, on average, compared to state-of-the-art dependency-agnostic baseline frameworks, and by 9.60% versus the dependency-and-shot-agnostic baseline, all while achieving a smaller makespan of the DQC execution.

We prove that this map yields a smooth Riemannian structure $g_{ij}$ if and only if the short-distance mutual information (MI) follows the anisotropic inverse-quadratic law (local exponent $X_{\\text{loc}}=2$). A key insight is that anisotropy is necessary to activate tensor geometry; isotropic MI forces conformal flatness $g_{ij} \\propto δ_{ij}$, suppressing shear degrees of freedom. We employ a parameterization-invariant unimodular split $g_{ij} = V^{2/D}γ_{ij}$, which rigorously separates local density fluctuations (volume $V$) from directional anisotropy (shape/shear $γ_{ij}$). We introduce ``MI Tomography,'' an operational protocol to reconstruct these geometric components from finite directional measurements. The protocol is validated using the equal-time ground state of an anisotropic 2D quantum harmonic lattice (massless relativistic scalar) on a torus, where the reconstructed shape tensor $γ_{ij}$ quantitatively recovers the physical coupling anisotropy. We work strictly in the local, fixed-coarse-graining $X_{\\text{loc}}=2$ branch; the line element is used solely to extract the local kinematic structure (the local metric tensor), deferring global distance claims."}

Our experiments reveal a strikingly consistent pattern: all models achieve perfect accuracy on the base tasks and remain fully generalise to redundant rule deletion and all equivalence-based rewrites (single or multi-law), but fail sharply under essential rule deletion (dropping to 25% accuracy) and collapse completely in the presence of explicit contradictions (0% accuracy). These results demonstrate that LLMs possess stable invariance to semantic-preserving logical transformations, yet remain fundamentally brittle to missing or conflicting evidence. Our framework provides a clean diagnostic tool for isolating such reasoning failure modes and highlights persistent gaps in the logical generalisation abilities of current LLMs."}

NKM integrates analytical ($α$) and biological ($β$) knowledge to guide feature grouping and control the hierarchical attention mechanisms to extract relevant patterns.

To demonstrate NKM's efficacy, we applied it to study the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our results suggest that NKM consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in forecasting trajectories of cognitive decline. Specifically, NKM (1) forecasts changes of multiple cognitive scores simultaneously, (2) quantifies differential biomarker contributions to predicting distinctive cognitive scores, and (3) identifies brain regions most predictive of cognitive deterioration.

By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons.

Here, we propose a methodology we term \\emph{gp2Scale} that scales exact Gaussian processes to more than 10 million data points without relying on inducing points, kernel interpolation, or neighborhood-based approximations, and instead leveraging the existing capabilities of a GP: its kernel design. Highly flexible, compactly supported, and non-stationary kernels lead to the identification of naturally occurring sparse structure in the covariance matrix, which is then exploited for the calculations of the linear system solution and the log-determinant for training. We demonstrate our method's functionality on several real-world datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art approximation algorithms.

This quasi-classical formulation enables us to isolate the role of electrons in coarsening dynamics. Following a thermal quench, CDW domains grow through the diffusion and annihilation of kinks -- topological defects separating the two symmetry-related CDW orders. While standard diffusive dynamics predicts domain sizes scaling as the square root of time, our large-scale simulations reveal a slower power-law growth with a temperature-dependent exponent. We trace this anomalous behavior to a cooperative kink hopping arising from Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and quasi-conservation of electron numbers. The correlated-hopping of kinks in turn gives rise to an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the kink density. These results uncover a new mechanism for slow coarsening and carry implications for phase-ordering in the full Holstein model and related electron-phonon systems."}

Utilizing the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation, we derive a set of self-consistent equations that evaluate the excitonic and photonic order parameters in a two-band electronic model, accounting equally for both electron-hole Coulomb attraction and light-matter coupling. Analyzing the competition among these condensate order parameters reveals a complex phase structure of coherent states in the ground state. As the mass imbalance is reduced, we observe a transition from a normal disordered electron-hole-photon system to excitoniclike, polariton, and ultimately photoniclike polariton condensation states. The distinct features of these robust condensates can be identified in the momentum distribution of the electron-hole pair amplitude and the photonic density, as well as in the wave-number-resolved photoemission spectra of electrons, holes, and photons. Increasing the excitation density further expands the range of condensation states. Additionally, lowering the mass imbalance leads to the emergence of quantum coherent bound states prior to the formation of robust condensates, which are evidenced by the static and dynamical excitonic and photonic susceptibility functions."}

These carefully engineered logical qubit states are parameter independent stationary states of the effective master equation governing the evolution of the ensemble and, consequently, constitute dark states and are invulnerable to dissipation and correlated collective dephasing. In particular, the logical qubit states are immune to single qutrit decay (the analogous of single photon loss process for qutrits) and simultaneous decay and driving of two qutrits (the analogous two-photon loss and driving processes for qutrits). In addition, we show how to implement the single-qubit quantum NOT gate and the Hadamard gate followed by either the phase gate or the phase and $Z$ gates. We study analytically the case of two qutrits and conclude that the logical qubit states exhibit parity-sensitive inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing: the even logical state is completely immune to these processes, while odd one is vulnerable. Nevertheless, in the presence of these interactions one can also define another odd state with mixed permutation symmetry that is immune to both inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing. We suggest that these results can be extrapolated to an arbitrary number of qutrits. The effective master equation is deduced from a physical system composed of two parametrically coupled cavities with one of them interacting dispersively with an ensemble of three-level atoms (the qutrits). In principle this physical system can be implemented by means of two coplanar waveguide resonators, a SQUID parametrically coupling them, and a cloud of alkali atoms close to one of the resonators."}

This setting encompasses driven soft matter as well as biomolecular, biochemical, and biophysical systems. Despite its central role, direct measurements of entropy production remain challenging - especially in small systems dominated by fluctuations. The main difficulty arises because not all degrees of freedom contributing to entropy production are experimentally accessible. A key question, therefore, is how to infer entropy production from coarse-grained observations, such as time series of experimentally measurable variables. Over the past decade, stochastic thermodynamics has provided several inequalities that yield model-free lower bounds on entropy production from such coarse-grained data. The major approaches rely on observations of coarse-grained states, fluctuating currents or ticks, correlation functions of coarse-grained observables, and waiting-time distributions between so-called Markovian events, which correspond to transitions between mesoscopic states. Here, we systematically review these techniques valid under the sole assumption of a Markovian, i.e., memoryless, dynamics on an underlying, not necessarily observable, network of states or following a possibly high-dimensional Langevin equation. We discuss in detail the large class of non-equilibrium steady states and highlight extensions of these methods to time-dependent and relaxing systems. While our focus is on mean entropy production, we also summarize recent progress in quantifying entropy production along individual coarse-grained trajectories."}

This approach creates city-specific planning criteria and evaluates the current coverage of public facilities. The primary contribution of this study is the successful derivation of a localized planning standards model and the deployment of an automated algorithm to assess service efficiency. Application of this model reveals a general service coverage average of 81.3%. Ambulance stations demonstrated the highest efficiency (99.8%) due to recent upgrades, while parks and open spaces recorded the lowest coverage (10%) caused by limited land availability. Spatial analysis indicates a high service density in midtown (>45 services/km^2), which diminishes significantly towards the outskirts (<5 services/km^2).

Our approach trains a diffusion prior directly on sparsely observed speed fields using two mask-aware training strategies: Single-Mask and Double-Mask. At the inference phase, the physics-guided posterior sampler alternates reverse-diffusion updates, observation projection, and physics-guided projection based on adaptive anisotropic smoothing to reconstruct the missing speed fields. The proposed framework is tested on the I-24 MOTION dataset with varying visibility ratios. Even under severe sparsity, with only 5% visibility, PMA-Diffusion outperforms other baselines across three reconstruction error metrics. Furthermore, PMA-diffusion trained with sparse observation nearly matches the performance of the baseline model trained on fully observed speed fields. The results indicate that combining mask-aware diffusion priors with a physics-guided posterior sampler provides a reliable and flexible solution for traffic state estimation under realistic sensing sparsity."}

Recent advances in quantum computing, particularly quantum linear system solvers, offer promising avenues to accelerate the most computationally intensive steps of IPMs. However, practical challenges such as quantum error, hardware noise, and sensitivity to poorly conditioned systems remain significant obstacles. In response, a series of Quantum IPMs (QIPMs) has been developed to address these challenges, incorporating techniques such as feasibility maintenance, iterative refinement, and preconditioning.

The relaxation time governing the ensemble convergence of the KS entropy displays an essential singularity at the transition, yielding a sharp boundary between the two dynamical regimes. This framework provides a trajectory-independent method for detecting ergodicity breaking that is broadly applicable to nonlinear lattice systems with conserved quantities."}

One simple method for doing so is to include statements describing beliefs maintained in the prompt space (in what we'll call their belief boxes). But when agents have such statements in belief boxes, how does it actually affect their behaviors and dispositions towards those beliefs? And does it significantly affect agents' ability to be persuasive in multi-agent scenarios? Likewise, if the agents are given instructions to be open-minded, how does that affect their behaviors? We explore these and related questions in a series of experiments. Our findings confirm that instructing agents to be open-minded affects how amenable they are to belief change. We show that incorporating belief statements and their strengths influences an agent's resistance to (and persuasiveness against) opposing viewpoints. Furthermore, it affects the likelihood of belief change, particularly when the agent is outnumbered in a debate by opposing viewpoints, i.e., peer pressure scenarios. The results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the belief box technique in reasoning and decision-making tasks."}

However, because LCU generally requires an ancillary system and complex controlled unitary operators, it is not regarded as a hardware-efficient routine. Recently, a randomized LCU implementation with many applications to early FTQC algorithms has been proposed that computes the same expectation values as the original LCU algorithm using a shallower quantum circuit with a single ancilla qubit, at the cost of a quadratically larger sampling overhead. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm intermediate between the original and randomized LCU that manages the tradeoff between sampling cost and the circuit size. Our algorithm divides the set of unitary operators into several groups and then randomly samples LCU circuits from these groups to evaluate the target expectation value. Notably, we analytically prove an underlying monotonicity: larger group sizes entail smaller sampling overhead, by introducing a quantity called the reduction factor, which determines the sampling overhead across all grouping strategies. Our hybrid algorithm not only enables substantial reductions in circuit depth and ancilla-qubit usage while nearly maintaining the sampling overhead of LCU-based non-Hermitian dynamics simulators, but also achieves intermediate scaling between virtual and coherent quantum linear system solvers. It further provides a virtual ground-state preparation scheme that requires only a resettable single-ancilla qubit and asymptotically shows advantages in both virtual and coherent LCU methods. Finally, by viewing quantum error detection as an LCU process, our approach clarifies when conventional and virtual detection should be applied selectively, thereby balancing sampling and hardware overhead."}

However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations."}

Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets (e.g., EdNet, Junyi) show that FlatFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, on the EdNet dataset, compared to the strongest hierarchical baseline (HiTSKT), its absolute AUC increased by 8.3%, while using less than 15% of parameters, and inference speed was about three times faster.

Empirically, we find that curvature systematically rises away from minima, producing effective forces that bias noisy dynamics back toward the endpoints - even when the loss remains nearly flat. These barriers persist longer than energetic barriers, shaping the late-time localization of solutions in parameter space. Our results highlight the role of curvature-induced entropic forces in governing both connectivity and confinement in deep learning landscapes."}

Telecom-band spin-photonic qubits, operating in the 1260-1675 nm wavelength range, are particularly well-suited for long-distance quantum communication due to minimal loss in standard optical fibers. Achieving scalability, however, hinges on fulfilling several stringent criteria: coherent spin-state control, deterministic and indistinguishable single-photon emission, and integration with nanophotonic structures that enhance radiative properties, such as lifetime, coherence, and photon indistinguishability. This study explores the state-of-the-art spin-photonic qubits across solid-state platforms, including diamond color centers, silicon carbide defect centers, quantum dots, and two-dimensional materials. Special attention is given to silicon-based emitters, particularly G, T, C- and Ci-centers, which promise monolithic integration with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology and telecom-band operation. We classify these systems based on spin-photon interface availability, CMOS process compatibility, and emitter scalability. We also discuss recent advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED), including Purcell enhancement and quality factor engineering in integrated photonic (circuits) environments. The work highlights emerging demonstrations of quantum networking over metropolitan scales and outlines the trajectory toward chip-scale quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs). It combines deterministic emitter creation, coherent spin manipulation, and quantum information processing. These developments pave the way for global quantum networks, enabling secure communication, distributed quantum computing, and quantum-enhanced sensing."}

In $1T$-TaS$_2$, this competition is tied to a sequence of CDW phases and a hysteretic metal-insulator transition, but details of the transition, especially the role of interlayer coupling, remain unresolved. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to determine the uniaxial dielectric response of bulk $1T$-TaS$_2$ from room temperature down to the commensurate insulating state. The room-temperature data reveal natural type-II hyperbolic behavior in the visible range, with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane permittivity. Temperature-dependent ellipsometry combined with anisotropic Bruggeman effective medium analysis shows that the metallic domains responsible for percolation evolve from disc-like to needle-like shapes, and that, upon heating, an additional intermediate phase emerges. These results identify the transition in $1T$-TaS$_2$ as a three-dimensional, interlayer-driven percolation process and establish this material as a natural, tunable hyperbolic medium."}

High-accuracy variational wavefunctions for the lowest states are used to compute two-dimensional phase-space structures, one-dimensional marginals, and the corresponding Shannon entropies, mutual information, and Cumulative Residual Jeffreys divergences. The analysis shows that the Wigner representation is uniquely responsive to interference effects and displays clear, nonmonotonic entropic behavior as the wells separate, whereas the modulus-Wigner and Husimi distributions account only for geometric splitting or coarse-grained delocalization. These findings establish a quantitative hierarchy in the ability of $W$, $|W|$, and $H$ to resolve structural changes in a quantum state and provide a general framework for assessing the descriptive power of different phase-space representations in systems with emerging bimodality or tunneling."}

Yet current evaluation practice, reporting a single accuracy number from a single run, obscures the variance underlying these results, making it impossible to distinguish genuine capability improvements from lucky sampling. We propose adopting Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), a metric from measurement science, to characterize this variance. ICC decomposes observed variance into between-query variance (task difficulty) and within-query variance (agent inconsistency), highlighting whether reported results reflect true capability or measurement noise. We evaluated on GAIA (Levels 1-3, measuring agentic capabilities across varying reasoning complexity) and FRAMES (measuring retrieval and factuality across multiple documents). We found that ICC varies dramatically with task structure, with reasoning and retrieval tasks (FRAMES) exhibit ICC=0.4955-0.7118 across models, and agentic tasks (GAIA) exhibiting ICC=0.304-0.774 across models. For sub-agent replacement decisions in agentic systems, accuracy improvements are only trustworthy if ICC also improves. We demonstrate that ICC converges by n=8-16 trials for structured tasks and n>=32 for complex reasoning, enabling practitioners to set evidence-based resampling budgets. We recommend reporting accuracy alongside ICC and within-query variance as standard practice, and propose updated Evaluation Cards capturing these metrics. By making evaluation stability visible, we aim to transform agentic benchmarking from opaque leaderboard competition to trustworthy experimental science.

Due to its simultaneously breaking U(1)-gauge and translational symmetries, intriguing vestigial phases which restore only one broken symmetry can emerge at an intermediate temperature regime. Previously, investigations on the vestigial phases of PDW were mainly focused on incommensurate PDW. However, the experimentally observed PDW is usually commensurate, whose vestigial phases have not been systematically investigated. Here we study the vestigial phases of 2D commensurate PDW with $n$-times expanded unit vectors, hosting different numbers of wave vectors. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we get the low energy effective model Hamiltonian. Subsequent renormalization group (RG) and Monte-Carlo (MC) studies are conducted to obtain the phase diagram and spatial dependent correlation functions. Our RG and MC calculations consistently yield the following result. For $n\\le 4$, besides the charge-4e/2e superconductivity, there exists the translational symmetry broken charge-density-wave (CDW) vetigial phase. Intriguingly, for $n\\ge 5$, the restore of the translational symmetry with increasing temperature is realized through two successive Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Such a two-step process leads into two critical vestigial phases, i.e. the critical-PDW and the critical-CDW phases, in which the discrete translational symmetry is quasily broken, leading into a power-law decaying density-density correlation even at 2D.

In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators."}

These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses demonstrate some effectiveness, most defense architectures are inherently fragmented. Consequently, they fail to provide full integrity assurance across the entire task execution pipeline, forcing unacceptable multi-dimensional compromises among security, functionality, and efficiency. Our method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory, distinct from the expected legitimate plan. Based on this, we propose the Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA), a holistic framework achieving full-lifecycle cognitive supervision. CCA constructs an efficient, dual-layered defense system through two synergistic pillars: (i) proactive and preemptive control-flow and data-flow integrity enforcement via a pre-generated \"Intent Graph\"; and (ii) an innovative \"Tiered Adjudicator\" that, upon deviation detection, initiates deep reasoning based on multi-dimensional scoring, specifically designed to counter complex conditional attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark substantiate that CCA not only effectively withstands sophisticated attacks that challenge other advanced defense methods but also achieves uncompromised security with notable efficiency and robustness, thereby reconciling the aforementioned multi-dimensional trade-off."}

At the same time, real-world deployments almost never serve full-precision models: post-training quantization to INT8 or lower precision is now standard practice for reducing memory and latency. This work asks a simple question: how do existing backdoor defenses behave under standard quantization pipelines? We conduct a systematic empirical study of five representative defenses across three precision settings (FP32, INT8 dynamic, INT4 simulated) and two standard vision benchmarks using a canonical BadNet attack. We observe that INT8 quantization reduces the detection rate of all evaluated defenses to 0% while leaving attack success rates above 99%. For INT4, we find a pronounced dataset dependence: Neural Cleanse remains effective on GTSRB but fails on CIFAR-10, even though backdoors continue to survive quantization with attack success rates above 90%. Our results expose a mismatch between how defenses are commonly evaluated (on FP32 models) and how models are actually deployed (in quantized form), and they highlight quantization robustness as a necessary axis in future evaluations and designs of backdoor defenses."}

This common origin implies that extreme crystal distortion, by narrowing bandwidths, enhancing correlations and reshaping the symmetries of altermagnetic spin splittings, could unify flat-band and altermagnetic physics in a single material; in practice, however, achieving such large distortions in a crystalline altermagnet is a formidable challenge. Here we combine a dedicated strain device with a tailored single-crystal mounting scheme to impose a highly tensile strain gradient in bulk CrSb, a prototypical altermagnet, creating a near-surface layer in which the in-plane lattice is strongly distorted relative to the weakly strained bulk, while the average bulk distortion remains small. Angle-resolved photoemission reveals a reversible regime at moderate strain, where a deeper flat-band feature, attributed to a strain-gradient-driven suppression of Cr-Sb hybridization, coexists with a correlation-enhanced Cr 3d flat band, and an irreversible regime at larger strain where partial bond decoupling drives a predominantly insulating spectral response. Density-functional calculations show that an orbital-selective altermagnetic spin texture persists across this correlated regime despite strong bandwidth renormalisation. These results define a strain-symmetry-correlation map for CrSb and establish extreme tensile strain as a route to co-engineer flat-band tendencies and spin-textured, zero-net-moment correlated states in altermagnets, pointing toward strain-adaptive, spin-selective Mott filtering and related device concepts."}

We here study the topological features of the LEPs in the system consisting of a qubit coupled to a non-Markovian reservoir.

By driving this material with an intense terahertz electromagnetic field, we bring its magnetisation into a non-equilibrium state and follow its evolution. We measure the sample's low temperature magnetic response in the time domain which leads to an unexpectedly rich multi-peaked spectrum in the Fourier domain, that cannot be explained by established models.

To resolve these limitations, we introduce a new class of methods with auto-exploration, or methods that automatically explore both state and action spaces in a parameter-free way, i.e.,~without a priori knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. We present two variants: one for the tabular setting and one for linear function approximation. Under algorithm-independent assumptions on the existence of an exploring optimal policy, both methods attain $O(ε^{-2})$ sample complexity to solve to $ε$ error. Crucially, these complexities are novel since they are void of algorithm-dependent parameters seen in prior works, which may be arbitrarily large. The methods are also simple to implement because they are parameter-free and do not directly estimate the unknown parameters. These feats are achieved by new algorithmic innovations for RL, including a dynamic mixing time, a discounted state distribution for sampling, a simple robust gradient estimator, and a recent advantage gap function to certify convergence."}

Central to our approach is the construction of a Hermitian generator from experimentally measurable spectra, which allows us to compute the quantum Fisher information (QFI) available in spin--orbital systems. The resulting QFI provides upper bounds for $k$-producible states and thus serves as a robust witness of spin--orbital entanglement. To account for realistic experimental limitations, we further extend our framework to include relaxed QFI bounds applicable to measurements lacking full polarization resolution."}

After general considerations on the significance of tests of the WEP using quantum states and the need for considering inertial and gravitational masses as operators, we develop a model to derive the matrix elements of the free-fall operator, showing that the variance of the acceleration operator, in addition to its mean, enables estimation of violations of the WEP due to quantum coherence in a way that is robust with respect to shot-to-shot fluctuations. Building on this analysis, we demonstrate how the validity of the WEP may be tested in a torsion balance setup, by accessing the mean and variance of a torque operator we introduce and quantize. Due to the long acquisition times of the signal as compared to the timescale on which coherent superposition states may survive, we further propose a dynamical setting, where the torsion balance is subject to a time-dependent gravitational field, and measurements of angular acceleration encode possible violations of the WEP."}

The prevailing practice is to leverage LLMs for log-based failure localization, attributing errors to a specific agent and step. However, this paradigm has two key limitations: (i) log-only debugging lacks validation, producing untested hypotheses, and (ii) single-step or single-agent attribution is often ill-posed, as we find that multiple distinct interventions can independently repair the failed task. To address the first limitation, we introduce DoVer, an intervention-driven debugging framework, which augments hypothesis generation with active verification through targeted interventions (e.g., editing messages, altering plans). For the second limitation, rather than evaluating on attribution accuracy, we focus on measuring whether the system resolves the failure or makes quantifiable progress toward task success, reflecting a more outcome-oriented view of debugging. Within the Magnetic-One agent framework, on the datasets derived from GAIA and AssistantBench, DoVer flips 18-28% of failed trials into successes, achieves up to 16% milestone progress, and validates or refutes 30-60% of failure hypotheses. DoVer also performs effectively on a different dataset (GSMPlus) and agent framework (AG2), where it recovers 49% of failed trials. These results highlight intervention as a practical mechanism for improving reliability in agentic systems and open opportunities for more robust, scalable debugging methods for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

This research introduces a reinforcement learning technique to learn switching thresholds between two orthogonal navigation policies. Using maze navigation as a case study, this work demonstrates how an agent can dynamically transition between systematic exploration (coverage) and goal-directed pathfinding (convergence) to improve task performance. Unlike fixed-threshold approaches, the agent uses Q-learning to adapt switching behavior based on coverage percentage and distance to goal, requiring only minimal domain knowledge: maze dimensions and target location. The agent does not require prior knowledge of wall positions, optimal threshold values, or hand-crafted heuristics; instead, it discovers effective switching strategies dynamically during each run. The agent discretizes its state space into coverage and distance buckets, then adapts which coverage threshold (20-60\\%) to apply based on observed progress signals. Experiments across 240 test configurations (4 maze sizes from 16$\\times$16 to 128$\\times$128 $\\times$ 10 unique mazes $\\times$ 6 agent variants) demonstrate that adaptive threshold learning outperforms both single-strategy agents and fixed 40\\% threshold baselines.

It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition."}

However, RL for VLMs requires abundant high-quality multimodal data, especially challenging in specialized domains like chemistry, earth sciences, and multimodal mathematics. Existing strategies such as synthetic data and self-rewarding mechanisms suffer from limited distributions and alignment difficulties, ultimately causing reward hacking: models exploit high-reward patterns, collapsing policy entropy and destabilizing training. We propose DoGe (Decouple to Generalize), a dual-decoupling framework that guides models to first learn from context rather than problem solving by refocusing on the problem context scenarios overlooked by synthetic data methods. By decoupling learning process into dual components (Thinker and Solver), we reasonably quantify the reward signals of this process and propose a two-stage RL post-training approach from freely exploring context to practically solving tasks. Second, to increase the diversity of training data, DoGe constructs an evolving curriculum learning pipeline: an expanded native domain knowledge corpus and an iteratively evolving seed problems pool. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms the baseline across various benchmarks, providing a scalable pathway for realizing self-evolving LVLMs."}

Although they can enable the learning of complex intelligent behaviors, such task accessories can result in unnatural task setups and hinder long-term performance in the real world. In this work, we explore the challenges of learning without episode terminations and robot embodiment resets using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. To learn without terminations, we present a continuing version of the SAC algorithm and show that, with simple modifications to the reward functions of existing tasks, continuing SAC can perform as well as or better than episodic SAC while reducing the sensitivity of performance to the value of the discount rate $γ$. On a modified Gym Reacher task, we investigate possible explanations for the failure of continuing SAC when learning without embodiment resets. Our results suggest that embodiment resets help with exploration of the state space in the SAC algorithm, and removing embodiment resets can lead to poor exploration of the state space and failure of or significantly slower learning. Finally, on additional simulated tasks and a real-robot vision task, we show that increasing the entropy of the policy when performance trends worse or remains static is an effective intervention for recovering the performance lost due to not using embodiment resets."}

However, when subject to resonant optical excitation, they can inadvertently transfer into a zero-spin optically dark state. We show that this unwanted change of charge state can be quickly reversed by the resonant laser itself in combination with static electric fields. By defining interdigitated metallic contacts on the diamond surface, we increase the steady-state SiV$^-$ photoluminescence under resonant excitation by a factor $\\ge3$ for most emitters, making it practically constant for certain individual emitters. We electrically activate single \\sivs near the positively biased electrode, which are entirely dark without applying local electric fields. Using time-resolved 3-color experiments, we show that the resonant laser not only excites the SiV$^-$, but also creates free holes that convert SiV$^{2-}$ to SiV$^-$ on a timescale of milliseconds. Through analysis of several individual emitters, our results show that the degree of electrical charge state controllability differs between individual emitters, indicating that their local environment plays a key role. Our proposed electric-field-based stabilization scheme enhances deterministic charge state control in group-IV color centers and improves its understanding, offering a scalable path toward quantum applications such as entanglement generation and quantum key distribution."}

This paper introduces Networked RMAB, a novel framework that integrates the RMAB model with the independent cascade model to capture interactions between arms in networked environments. We define the Bellman equation for networked RMAB and present its computational challenge due to exponentially large action and state spaces. To resolve the computational challenge, we establish the submodularity of Bellman equation and apply the hill-climbing algorithm to achieve a $1-\\frac{1}{e}$ approximation guarantee in Bellman updates. Lastly, we prove that the approximate Bellman updates are guaranteed to converge by a modified contraction analysis. We experimentally verify these results by developing an efficient Q-learning algorithm tailored to the networked setting. Experimental results on real-world graph data demonstrate that our Q-learning approach outperforms both $k$-step look-ahead and network-blind approaches, highlighting the importance of capturing and leveraging network effects where they exist."}

At half-filling, the zero-temperature ground state is a commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) with alternating occupied and empty sites. This quasi-classical formulation enables us to isolate the role of electrons in coarsening dynamics. Following a thermal quench, CDW domains grow through the diffusion and annihilation of kinks -- topological defects separating the two symmetry-related CDW orders. While standard diffusive dynamics predicts domain sizes scaling as the square root of time, our large-scale simulations reveal a slower power-law growth with a temperature-dependent exponent. We trace this anomalous behavior to a cooperative kink hopping arising from Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and quasi-conservation of electron numbers. The correlated-hopping of kinks in turn gives rise to an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the kink density. These results uncover a new mechanism for slow coarsening and carry implications for phase-ordering in the full Holstein model and related electron-phonon systems."}

In the diagnosis phase, a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 classification models (Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine) are used. Each model progressively classifies the patient's brain into increasingly specific categories, with the final step being named diagnosis. For treatment planning, an RL system consisting of 3 generative models is used. First, the resection model (diffusion model) analyzes the diagnosed GBM MRI and predicts a possible resection outcome. Second, the radiotherapy model (Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer) generates an MRI of the brain's progression after a user-defined number of weeks. Third, the chemotherapy model (Diffusion Model) produces the post-treatment MRI. A survival rate calculator (Convolutional Neural Network) then checks if the generated post treatment MRI has a survival rate within 15% of the user defined target. If not, a feedback loop using proximal policy optimization iterates over this system until an optimal resection location is identified.

We resolve this paradox by identifying entropic barriers arising from the interplay between curvature variations along these paths and noise in optimization dynamics. Empirically, we find that curvature systematically rises away from minima, producing effective forces that bias noisy dynamics back toward the endpoints - even when the loss remains nearly flat. These barriers persist longer than energetic barriers, shaping the late-time localization of solutions in parameter space. Our results highlight the role of curvature-induced entropic forces in governing both connectivity and confinement in deep learning landscapes."}

Existing scheduling approaches use dedicated bus qubits for routing and separate peripheral ancilla qubit factories for magic state preparation, leading to inefficient resource utilization. With the advent of magic state cultivation, preparation qubits can be placed anywhere within the surface code architecture. We introduce Pure Magic scheduling, which dynamically re-purposes magic state cultivation qubits for routing operations, eliminating dedicated bus infrastructure. By interrupting cultivation when qubits are needed for routing, Pure Magic naturally favors shorter cultivation times while ensuring no ancilla qubit remains idle. Our evaluation across 17 benchmark circuits improves scheduling efficiency by 19% to 223% compared to traditional bus routing and decreases average magic state preparation time by 2.6x to 9.7x. Benefits scale with circuit parallelism, making Pure Magic particularly valuable for highly parallel quantum algorithms. The Pure Magic architecture represents a paradigm shift from static to dynamic, demand-driven scheduling in fault-tolerant quantum architectures."}

Although clinical notes contain rich, detailed patient information and make up a large portion of electronic health records (EHRs), they remain underutilized for HF readmission risk analysis. Traditional computational models for HF readmission often rely on expert-crafted rules, medical thesauri, and ontologies to interpret clinical notes, which are typically written under time pressure and may contain misspellings, abbreviations, and domain-specific jargon. We present ClinNoteAgents, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that transforms free-text clinical notes into (1) structured representations of clinical and social risk factors for association analysis and (2) clinician-style abstractions for HF 30-day readmission prediction. We evaluate ClinNoteAgents on 3,544 notes from 2,065 patients (readmission rate=35.16%), demonstrating strong performance in extracting risk factors from free-text, identifying key contributing factors, and predicting readmission risk. By reducing reliance on structured fields and minimizing manual annotation and model training, ClinNoteAgents provides a scalable and interpretable approach to note-based HF readmission risk modeling in data-limited healthcare systems."}

These algorithms typically begin by transforming the original nonlinear ODE into a higher-dimensional linear ODE using a linearization technique, most commonly Carleman linearization. Existing works restrict their analysis to ODEs where the nonlinearities are polynomial functions of the dependent variables, significantly limiting their applicability. In this work we construct an efficient quantum algorithm for solving ODEs with `Fourier' nonlinear terms expressible as $d{\\bf u}/dt = G_0 + G_1 e^{i{\\bf u}}$, where ${\\bf u}$ denotes a vector of $n$ complex variables evolving with $t$, $G_0$ is an $n$-dimensional complex vector, $G_1$ is an $n \\times n$ complex matrix and $e^{i{\\bf u}}$ denotes the vector with entries $\\{e^{iu_j}\\}$. To tackle the Fourier nonlinear term, which is not expressible as a finite sum of polynomials of ${\\bf u}$, our algorithm employs a generalization of the Carleman linearization technique known as Koopman linearization. We also make other methodological advances towards relaxing the stringent dissipativity condition required for efficient solution extraction and towards integrated readout of classical quantities from the solution state. Our results open avenues to the development of efficient quantum algorithms for a significantly wider class of high-dimensional nonlinear ODEs, thereby broadening the scope of their applications."}

In practice, many agent stacks degrade into decorated chains of LLM calls with no structural mechanisms for reliability. We present VIGIL (Verifiable Inspection and Guarded Iterative Learning), a reflective runtime that supervises a sibling agent and performs autonomous maintenance rather than task execution. VIGIL ingests behavioral logs, appraises each event into a structured emotional representation, maintains a persistent EmoBank with decay and contextual policies, and derives an RBT diagnosis that sorts recent behavior into strengths, opportunities, and failures. From this analysis, VIGIL generates both guarded prompt updates that preserve core identity semantics and read only code proposals produced by a strategy engine that operates on log evidence and code hotspots. VIGIL functions as a state gated pipeline. Illegal transitions produce explicit errors rather than allowing the LLM to improvise. In a reminder latency case study, VIGIL identified elevated lag, proposed prompt and code repairs, and when its own diagnostic tool failed due to a schema conflict, it surfaced the internal error, produced a fallback diagnosis, and emitted a repair plan. This demonstrates meta level self repair in a deployed agent runtime."}

Temporal evolution is captured via fractional stochastic differential operators embedded within graph-based recurrent networks, enabling the modeling of long-term dependencies and stochastic fluctuations in network dynamics. Attention mechanisms fuse multimodal information and generate interpretable biomarkers, including network energy entropy, graph curvature, fractional memory indices, and modality-specific attention scores. These biomarkers are combined into a composite prognostic index to quantify individual risk of network instability or cognitive decline.

Although TSP has been studied extensively on quantum computers, it is rare to find quantum solutions of TSP network with more than a dozen locations. In this paper, we present high quality solutions in noise-free Qiskit simulations of networks with up to twelve locations using a hybrid penalty-free, circuit-model, Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA). Noisy qubits are also simulated. To our knowledge, this is the first successful VQA simulation of a twelve-location TSP on circuit-model devices. Multiple encoding strategies, including factorial, non-factorial, and Gray encoding are evaluated. Our formulation scales as $\\mathcal{O}(nlog_2(n))$ qubits, requiring only 29 qubits for twelve locations, compared with over 100 qubits for conventional approaches scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Computational time is further reduced by almost two orders of magnitude through the use of Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) gradient estimation and cost-function caching. We also introduce a novel machine-learning model, and benchmark both quantum and classical approaches against a Monte Carlo baseline. The VQA outperforms the classical machine-learning approach, and performs similarly to Monte Carlo for the small networks simulated.

We prove the taxonomy's visual coherence by training a CNN on raw grid pixels (95.24% accuracy on S3, 36.25% overall, 3.3x chance), then apply the taxonomy diagnostically to the original ARC-AGI-2 test set. Our curriculum analysis reveals 35.3% of tasks exhibit low neural affinity for Transformers--a distributional bias mirroring ARC-AGI-2. To probe this misalignment, we fine-tuned a 1.7M-parameter Transformer across 302 tasks, revealing a profound Compositional Gap: 210 of 302 tasks (69.5%) achieve >80% cell accuracy (local patterns) but <10% grid accuracy (global synthesis). This provides direct evidence for a Neural Affinity Ceiling Effect, where performance is bounded by architectural suitability, not curriculum. Applying our framework to Li et al.'s independent ViTARC study (400 specialists, 1M examples each) confirms its predictive power: Very Low affinity tasks achieve 51.9% versus 77.7% for High affinity (p<0.001), with a task at 0% despite massive data.

Among various XAI approaches, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has gained prominence due to its ability to provide both global and local explanations across different machine learning models. While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds. To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations. This integration is guided by user-defined parameters (such as feature aliases, descriptions, and additional background) to tailor the explanation to both the model context and the user perspective. We hypothesize that this enhancement can improve the perceived understandability of SHAP explanations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed package, we applied it in a healthcare-related case study and conducted user evaluations involving real end-users. The results, based on Likert-scale surveys and follow-up interviews, indicate that the generated explanations were perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate compared to visual-only outputs. While the findings are preliminary, they suggest that combining visualization with contextualized text may support more user-friendly and trustworthy model explanations."}

The standard objective used in reward modeling is the Bradley-Terry (BT) loss, which learns from pairwise data consisting of a pair of chosen and rejected responses. In this work, we analyze the per-sample gradient of BT-loss and show that its norm scales with two distinct components: (1) the difference in predicted rewards between chosen and rejected responses, which reflects the prediction error, and critically, (2) representation distance between the pair measured in the output space of the final layer. While the first term captures the intended training signal, we show that the second term can significantly impact the update magnitude and misalign learning. Specifically, pairs with small representation distance often receive vanishingly weak updates, even when misranked, while pairs with large distance receive disproportionately strong updates. This leads to gradients from large-distance pairs to overshadow those from small-distance pairs, where fine-grained distinctions are especially important. To overcome this limitation, we propose NormBT, an adaptive pair-wise normalization scheme that balances representation-driven effects and focuses learning signals on prediction error. NormBT is a lightweight, drop-in integration to BT loss with negligible overhead. Across various LLM backbones and datasets, NormBT improves reward model performance consistently, with notable gains of over 5% on the Reasoning category of RewardBench, which contains numerous small-distance pairs. This work reveals a key limitation in the widely used BT objective and provides a simple, effective correction."}

The signal to be protected can be retrieved with a minimal distortion after having been transmitted through a noisy channel. Demonstrated by typical examples of encoding signal on two-level superposition state or Einstein-Podolsky-Rossen state transmitted through random telegraph noise and decoherence noises channel, the mean squared error distortion may be close to $0$ and the fault-tolerant capability could reach $1$ with finite quantum resources.

To overcome these limitations, a Practical Interlinked Concept Knowledge Tracing (PICKT) model that can effectively process multiple types of input data is proposed. Specifically, a knowledge map structures the relationships among concepts considering the question and concept text information, thereby enabling effective knowledge tracing even in cold start situations. Experiments reflecting real operational environments demonstrated the model's excellent performance and practicality. The main contributions of this research are as follows. First, a model architecture that effectively utilizes diverse data formats is presented. Second, significant performance improvements are achieved over existing models for two core cold start challenges: new student enrollment and new question addition. Third, the model's stability and practicality are validated through delicate experimental design, enhancing its applicability in real-world product environments.

Understanding the high generalization ability of large-scale models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) remains one of the central open problems in machine learning theory. While recent theoretical studies have attributed this phenomenon to the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) toward well-generalizing solutions, empirical evidences indicate that it primarily stems from properties of the model itself. Specifically, even randomly sampled interpolators, which are parameters that achieve zero training error, have been observed to generalize effectively. In this study, under a teacher-student framework, we prove that the generalization error of randomly sampled interpolators becomes exactly zero once the number of training samples exceeds a threshold determined by the geometric structure of the interpolator set in parameter space.

However, existing approaches typically treat observations as high-level conditioning inputs to the denoising network, rather than integrating them into the stochastic dynamics of the diffusion process itself. As a result, sampling must begin from random Gaussian noise, weakening the coupling between perception and control and often yielding suboptimal performance. We introduce BridgePolicy, a generative visuomotor policy that explicitly embeds observations within the stochastic differential equation via a diffusion-bridge formulation. By constructing an observation-informed trajectory, BridgePolicy enables sampling to start from a rich, informative prior rather than random noise, substantially improving precision and reliability in control. A key challenge is that classical diffusion bridges connect distributions with matched dimensionality, whereas robotic observations are heterogeneous and multi-modal and do not naturally align with the action space. To address this, we design a multi-modal fusion module and a semantic aligner that unify visual and state inputs and align observation and action representations, making the bridge applicable to heterogeneous robot data. Extensive experiments across 52 simulation tasks on three benchmarks and five real-world tasks demonstrate that BridgePolicy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative policies."}

Meanwhile, to establish and maintain high-visibility GHZ measurement among three independent users, we developed a three-party phase compensation scheme combined with precise temporal and polarization alignment within a time-bin-phase encoding framework. Furthermore, we designed an efficient pairing strategy to simplify subsequent data processing and enhance processing efficiency. Based on these techniques, we successfully performed QCC experiments over total channel losses of 66.3 dB, corresponding to 331.5 km of commercial fiber (0.2 dB/km), achieving secure key rates of 5.4 bit/s, whereas previous QCC experiments have been limited to 100 km.

By building knowledge graphs (KGs), the product matching problem can be converted to the Entity Alignment (EA) task, which aims to discover the equivalent entities from diverse KGs.

This paper introduces a two-stage pipeline consisting of rough filter and fine filter to match products from eBay and Amazon. For fine filtering, a new framework for Entity Alignment, Relation-aware and Attribute-aware Graph Attention Networks for Entity Alignment (RAEA), is employed. RAEA focuses on the interactions between attribute triples and relation triples, where the entity representation aggregates the alignment signals from attributes and relations with Attribute-aware Entity Encoder and Relation-aware Graph Attention Networks. The experimental results indicate that the RAEA model achieves significant improvements over 12 baselines on EA task in the cross-lingual dataset DBP15K (6.59% on average Hits@1) and delivers competitive results in the monolingual dataset DWY100K.

Feature propagation (FP) is a well-known method that performs well for imputation of missing node features on graphs, but it still has the following three issues: 1) it struggles with graphs that are not fully connected, 2) imputed features face the over-smoothing problem, and 3) FP is tailored for transductive tasks, overlooking the feature distribution shift in inductive tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce DDFI, a Diverse and Distribution-aware Missing Feature Imputation method that combines feature propagation with a graph-based Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) in a nontrivial manner. It first designs a simple yet effective algorithm, namely Co-Label Linking (CLL), that randomly connects nodes in the training set with the same label to enhance the performance on graphs with numerous connected components. Then we develop a novel two-step representation generation process at the inference stage. Specifically, instead of directly using FP-imputed features as input during inference, DDFI further reconstructs the features through the whole MAE to reduce feature distribution shift in the inductive tasks and enhance the diversity of node features. Meanwhile, since existing feature imputation methods for graphs only evaluate by simulating the missing scenes with manually masking the features, we collect a new dataset called Sailing from the records of voyages that contains naturally missing features to help better evaluate the effectiveness. Extensive experiments conducted on six public datasets and Sailing show that DDFI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under both transductive and inductive settings."}

Artificial intelligence techniques, which use a neural network component in various forms, have recently frequently been used to accomplish this step. However, the complexity of the neural network structure still stands up as a critical problem against prediction accuracy. In this paper, a method inspired by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control approach is investigated to enhance the performance of neural network models used for multi-step ahead prediction of periodic time-series information while maintaining a negligible impact on the complexity of the system. The PID-based method is applied to the predicted value at each time step to bring that value closer to the real value. The water demand forecasting problem is considered as a case study, where two deep neural network models from the literature are used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed boosting method. Furthermore, to prove the applicability of this PID-based booster to other types of periodic time-series prediction problems, it is applied to enhance the accuracy of a neural network model used for multi-step forecasting of hourly energy consumption. The comparison between the results of the original prediction models and the results after using the proposed technique demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in terms of prediction accuracy and system complexity."}

We show that both paradigms instantiate the same geometric structure: each learns a set of linear directions in activation space whose nonnegative combinations form a concept cone. Supervised and unsupervised methods thus differ not in kind but in how they select this cone. Building on this view, we propose an operational bridge between the two paradigms.

This paper proposes a novel successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based Kennedy receiver for uplink NOMA-OQC systems, along with a new approach for power allocation of the coherent states emitted by users. The key idea is to rigorously derive the asymptotic sum-rate of the considered systems, taking into account the impact of atmospheric turbulence, background noise, and lossy photon channel. With the asymptotic sum-rate, we optimize the average number of photons (or powers) of the coherent states emitted by the users. Variable substitution and successive convex approximation (SCA) are employed to convexify and maximize the asymptotic sum-rate iteratively. A new coherent-state power allocation algorithm is developed for a small-to-medium number of users. We further develop its low-complexity variant using adaptive importance sampling, which is suitable for scenarios with a medium-to-large number of users.

Rather than focusing on aggregate scores, we perform fine-grained, per-trial behavioral analysis to surface the strategies that enable successful multi-step tool execution and the recurrent failure modes that undermine reliability. Our findings show that model scale alone does not predict agentic robustness: Llama 4 Maverick (400B) performs only marginally better than Granite 4 Small (32B) in some uncertainty-driven tasks, while DeepSeek V3.1's superior reliability derives primarily from post-training reinforcement learning rather than architecture or size. Across models, we identify four recurring failure archetypes: premature action without grounding, over-helpfulness that substitutes missing entities, vulnerability to distractor-induced context pollution, and fragile execution under load. These patterns highlight the need for agentic evaluation methods that emphasize interactive grounding, recovery behavior, and environment-aware adaptation, suggesting that reliable enterprise deployment requires not just stronger models but deliberate training and design choices that reinforce verification, constraint discovery, and adherence to source-of-truth data."}

To achieve this, we identify a closed-form expression for the initialisation of the parameters, differing from the original \\texttt{SIREN} scheme. This expression is derived from fixed points obtained through the convergence of pre-activation distribution and the variance of Jacobian sequences. Controlling both gradients and targeting vanishing pre-activation helps preventing the emergence of inappropriate frequencies during estimation, thereby improving generalization.

Each Floquet period consists of ground-state coupling followed by a pulse driving the transition from the ground state to the Rydberg state. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that after a defined evolution time, neutral atoms within Rydberg ensembles can collectively form a $W$ state in the ground-state manifold.

The quantum Mpemba effect is present for tilted ferromagnetic states at all interaction ranges, but absent for tilted antiferromagnetic states, and occurs for the domain-wall state only in effectively short-ranged circuits, where the Mpemba time $t_{\\rm M}$ is found to scale with the subsystem size $N_A$ as $t_{\\rm M}\\!\\sim\\!N_{A}^{\\,z}$, with the dynamical exponent $z=\\min(α-1,2)$. These results reveal how the quantum Mpemba effect is governed by the interplay between interaction range and initial-state charge bias in long-ranged chaotic systems."}

Scaling RL to this size exposes critical inefficiencies-zero-variance prompts that waste rollouts, unstable importance sampling over long horizons, advantage inversion from standard reward models, and systemic bottlenecks in rollout processing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce several unified innovations: (1) Multi-Stage Zero-Variance Elimination, which filters out non-informative prompts and stabilizes group-based policy optimization (e.g. GRPO) by removing wasted rollouts; (2) ESPO, an entropy-adaptive optimization method that balances token-level and sequence-level importance sampling to maintain stable learning dynamics; (3) a Router Replay strategy that aligns training-time MoE router decisions with inference-time behavior to mitigate train-infer discrepancies, coupled with a reward model adjustment to prevent advantage inversion; (4) a high-throughput RL system with FP8-precision rollouts, overlapped reward computation, and length-aware scheduling to eliminate performance bottlenecks. Together, these contributions form a cohesive pipeline that makes RL on hundred-billion-scale MoE models stable and efficient. The resulting model delivers strong performance across both internal and public evaluations."}

Dynamic sparsity (DS) attention mitigates this, yet its hardware efficiency is limited by the added prediction stage and the heavy memory traffic it entails. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BitStopper, a fine-grained algorithm-architecture co-design that operates without a sparsity predictor. First, a bit-serial enable stage fusion (BESF) mechanism is proposed to reuse and minimize the memory access by progressively terminating trivial tokens and merging the prediction stage into the execution stage. Second, a lightweight and adaptive token selection (LATS) strategy is developed to work in concert with the bit-level sparsity speculation. Third, a bit-level asynchronous processing (BAP) strategy is employed to improve compute utilization during the on-demand bit-grained memory fetching. Finally, an elaborate architecture is designed to translate the theoretical complexity reduction into practical performance improvement. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer accelerators, BitStopper achieves 2.03x and 1.89x speedups over Sanger and SOFA, respectively, while delivering 2.4x and 2.1x improvements in energy efficiency."}

Motivated by this behavior, we construct a QCA combining a pure dissipative phase with a constraint-preserving unitary evolution that redistributes probability within this manifold. Tensor Network simulations reveal that repeated dissipative--unitary cycles concentrate population on MIS configurations. We also provide an empirical estimate of how the convergence time scales with graph size, suggesting that QCA dynamics can provide an efficient alternative to adiabatic and variational quantum optimization methods based exclusively on local and translationally invariant rules."}

To bridge this gap, we formulate the problem as a multi-turn reinforcement learning task, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn output as the outcome reward. To mitigate sparse supervision and promote long-term attack strategies, we propose two heuristic process rewards: (1) controlling the harmfulness of intermediate outputs to prevent triggering the black-box model's rejection mechanisms, and (2) maintaining the semantic relevance of intermediate outputs to avoid drifting into irrelevant content. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show consistently improved attack success rates across multiple models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

QCSC leverages quantum computers to perform the classically intractable task of sampling the dominant fermionic configurations from the Hilbert space that have substantial support to a target state, followed by Hamiltonian diagonalization on a classical processor. However, noisy quantum hardware produces erroneous samples upon measurements, making robust and efficient configuration-recovery strategies essential for a scalable QCSC pipeline. Toward this, in this work, we introduce PIGen-SQD, an efficiently designed QCSC workflow that utilizes the capability of generative machine learning (ML) along with physics-informed configuration screening via implicit low-rank tensor decompositions for accurate fermionic state reconstruction. The physics-informed pruning is based on a class of efficient perturbative measures that, in conjunction with hardware samples, provide a substantial overlap with the target state. This distribution induces an anchoring effect on the generative ML models to stochastically explore only the dominant sector of the Hilbert space for effective identification of additional important configurations in a self-consistent manner. Our numerical experiments performed on IBM Heron R2 quantum processors demonstrate this synergistic workflow produces compact, high-fidelity subspaces that substantially reduce diagonalization cost while maintaining chemical accuracy under strong electronic correlations. By embedding classical many body intuitions directly into the generative ML model, PIGen-SQD advances the robustness and scalability of QCSC algorithms, offering a promising pathway toward chemically reliable quantum simulations on utility-scale quantum hardware."}

This omission creates a blind spot because practitioners cannot reliably assess whether a method's reported performance is stable, reproducible, or cost-consistent. We introduce ReasonBENCH, the first benchmark designed to quantify the underlying instability in LLM reasoning. ReasonBENCH provides (i) a modular evaluation library that standardizes reasoning frameworks, models, and tasks, (ii) a multi-run protocol that reports statistically reliable metrics for both quality and cost, and (iii) a public leaderboard to encourage variance-aware reporting. Across tasks from different domains, we find that the vast majority of reasoning strategies and models exhibit high instability. Notably, even strategies with similar average performance can display confidence intervals up to four times wider, and the top-performing methods often incur higher and less stable costs. Such instability compromises reproducibility across runs and, consequently, the reliability of reported performance. To better understand these dynamics, we further analyze the impact of prompts, model families, and scale on the trade-off between solve rate and stability. Our results highlight reproducibility as a critical dimension for reliable LLM reasoning and provide a foundation for future reasoning methods and uncertainty quantification techniques.

Supercond", "summary": "As quantum computing processors increase in size, there is growing interest in developing cryogenic electronics to overcome significant challenges to system scaling. Single flux-quantum (SFQ) circuits offer a promising alternative to remote, bulky, and power-hungry room temperature electronics. To meet the need for digital qubit control, readout, and co-processing, SFQ circuits must be adapted to operate at millikelvin temperatures near quantum processors. SEEQC's SFQuClass digital quantum management approach proximally places energy-efficient SFQ (ERSFQ) circuits and qubits in a multi-chip module. This enables extremely low power dissipation, compatible with a typical dilution cryostat's limited cooling power, while maintaining high processing speed and low error rates. We report on systematic testing from 4 K to 10 mK of a comprehensive set of ERSFQ cells, as well as more complex circuits such as programmable counters and demultiplexers used in digital qubit control. We compare the operating margins and error rates of these circuits and find that, at millikelvin, bias margins decrease and the center of the margins (i.e., the optimal bias current value) increases by ~15%, compared to 4.2 K. The margins can be restored by thermal annealing by reducing Josephson junction (JJ) critical current Ic. To provide guidance for how circuit parameters vary from 4.2 K to millikelvin, relevant analog process control monitors (PCMs) were tested in the temperature range of interest. The measured JJ critical current (of the PCM JJ arrays) increases by ~15% when decreasing temperature from 4.2 K to millikelvin, in good agreement with both theory and the empirically measured change in the center of bias margins for the tested digital circuits."}

A high-quality LLM is used to propose topics, generate causal questions, and extract plausible causal statements from a diverse range of domains. The technical challenge is then to take these isolated, fragmented, potentially ambiguous and possibly conflicting causal claims, and weave them into a coherent whole, converting them into relational causal triples and embedding them into a LCM. Addressing this technical challenge required inventing new categorical machine learning methods, which we can only briefly summarize in this paper, as it is focused more on the systems side of building DEMOCRITUS. We describe the implementation pipeline for DEMOCRITUS comprising of six modules, examine its computational cost profile to determine where the current bottlenecks in scaling the system to larger models.

Second, a blue team used black-box, model-internals, or training-based approaches to identify sandbagging models. We found that the blue team could not reliably discriminate sandbaggers from benign models. Black-box approaches were defeated by effective imitation of a weaker model. Linear probes, a model-internals approach, showed more promise but their naive application was vulnerable to behaviours instilled by the red team. We also explored capability elicitation as a strategy for detecting sandbagging. Although Prompt-based elicitation was not reliable, training-based elicitation consistently elicited full performance from the sandbagging models, using only a single correct demonstration of the evaluation task. However the performance of benign models was sometimes also raised, so relying on elicitation as a detection strategy was prone to false-positives. In the short-term, we recommend developers remove potential sandbagging using on-distribution training for elicitation. In the longer-term, further research is needed to ensure the efficacy of training-based elicitation, and develop robust methods for sandbagging detection.

However, we demonstrate that such synthetic releases can still leak information about the underlying training samples through structural overlap in the data manifold. We propose a black-box membership inference attack that exploits this vulnerability without requiring access to model internals or real data. The attacker repeatedly queries the generative model to obtain large numbers of synthetic samples, performs unsupervised clustering to identify dense regions of the synthetic distribution, and then analyzes cluster medoids and neighborhoods that correspond to high-density regions in the original training data. These neighborhoods act as proxies for training samples, enabling the adversary to infer membership or reconstruct approximate records. Our experiments across healthcare, finance, and other sensitive domains show that cluster overlap between real and synthetic data leads to measurable membership leakage-even when the generator is trained with differential privacy or other noise mechanisms.

Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes. The two-atom configuration thus realizes a genuine quantum-enhanced cooling mechanism absent in the single-atom case. We further outline an experimental implementation using two superconducting qubits repeatedly prepared, coupled, and reset inside a 3D cavity. Realistic reset and flux-tuning protocols support MHz-rate interaction cycles, enabling engineered reservoirs to impose cavity temperatures of 50-120 mK even when the cryostat is at ~1 K, offering a pathway to autonomous, on-chip refrigeration of microwave modes in scalable quantum hardware."}

Despite advances, it is as of yet challenging for existing methodological frameworks to integrate multimodal data for longitudinal personalized forecasting while maintaining interpretability. To address this gap, we present the Neural Koopman Machine (NKM), a new machine learning architecture inspired by dynamical systems and attention mechanisms, designed to forecast multiple cognitive scores simultaneously using multimodal genetic, neuroimaging, proteomic, and demographic data. NKM integrates analytical ($α$) and biological ($β$) knowledge to guide feature grouping and control the hierarchical attention mechanisms to extract relevant patterns. By implementing Fusion Group-Aware Hierarchical Attention within the Koopman operator framework, NKM transforms complex nonlinear trajectories into interpretable linear representations. To demonstrate NKM's efficacy, we applied it to study the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our results suggest that NKM consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in forecasting trajectories of cognitive decline. Specifically, NKM (1) forecasts changes of multiple cognitive scores simultaneously, (2) quantifies differential biomarker contributions to predicting distinctive cognitive scores, and (3) identifies brain regions most predictive of cognitive deterioration. Together, NKM advances personalized, interpretable forecasting of future cognitive decline in AD using past multimodal data through an explainable, explicit system and reveals potential multimodal biological underpinnings of AD progression."}

Once fixed coordinates and operators are removed, a neural network appears as a learnable numerical computation shaped by manifold complexity, high--order nonlinearity, and boundary conditions. Real--world data impose strong data complexity, near-infinite scope, scale, and minibatch fragmentation, while training dynamics produce learning complexity through shifting node covers, curvature accumulation, and the rise and decay of plasticity. These forces constrain learnability and explain why capability emerges only when fixed--point regions stabilize. Neural networks do not begin with fixed points; they construct them through residual--driven iteration. This perspective clarifies the limits of monolithic models under geometric and data--induced plasticity and motivates architectures and federated systems that distribute manifold complexity across many elastic models, forming a coherent world--modeling framework grounded in geometry, algebra, fixed points, and real--data complexity."}

In this work, we present a consistent formalism which has the traditional state-observable framework integrated with the desirable features of dBBT. We adopt ensemble interpretation for the Schrodinger wave function. Given a Schrodinger wave function, we use its value u at some fixed time (say, t = 0) to define the probability measure |u|sqdx on the system configuration space. On the resulting probability space M0, we introduce a stochastic process xi(t) corresponding to the Heisenberg position operator XH(t) such that, in the Heisenberg state phi corresponding to u, the expectation value of XH(t) equals that of xi(t) in M0. This condition leads to the de Broglie-Bohmguidance equation for the sample paths of the process xi(t) which are, therefore, Bohmian trajectories supposedly representing time-evolutions of individual members of the u-ensemble. Stochastic processes and Bohmian trajectories corresponding to observables with discrete eigenvalues (in particular spin) are treated by extending the configuration space to the spectral space of the commutative algebra obtained by adding appropriate discrete observables to the position observables. Pauli's equation is treated as an example. A straightforward derivation of von Neumann's projection rule employing the Schrodinger - Bohm evolution of individual systems along their Bohmian trajectories is given. Some comments on the potential application of the formalism developed here to quantum mechanics of the universe are included."}

We identify limitations in existing approaches for invariant representation learning that solely rely on classical information-theoretic measures, motivating the need to precisely focus on redundant information about the target $Y$ shared between spurious subgraphs $G_s$ and invariant subgraphs $G_c$ obtained via PID. Next, we propose a new multi-level optimization framework that we call -- Redundancy-guided Invariant Graph learning (RIG) -- that maximizes redundant information while isolating spurious and causal subgraphs, enabling OOD generalization under diverse distribution shifts. Our approach relies on alternating between estimating a lower bound of redundant information (which itself requires an optimization) and maximizing it along with additional objectives. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our proposed RIG framework."}

The Hierarchical Gated Recurrence with Additive Skip Connections component adds a multiplication-free pathway that improves long-range information flow and reduces forget-gate degradation. We evaluate QL-LSTM on sentiment classification using the IMDB dataset with extended document lengths, comparing it to LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM reference models. QL-LSTM achieves competitive accuracy while using substantially fewer parameters.

We show that this mechanism naturally gives rise to classical chaotic behavior, most notably sensitivity to initial conditions.

We propose \\emph{Temporal Range}, a model-agnostic metric that treats first-order sensitivities of multiple vector outputs across a temporal window to the input sequence as a temporal influence profile and summarizes it by the magnitude-weighted average lag. Temporal Range is computed via reverse-mode automatic differentiation from the Jacobian blocks $\\partial y_s/\\partial x_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^{c\\times d}$ averaged over final timesteps $s\\in\\{t+1,\\dots,T\\}$ and is well-characterized in the linear setting by a small set of natural axioms.

We also report Temporal Range for a compact Long Expressive Memory (LEM) policy trained on the task, using it as a proxy readout of task-level memory. Our axiomatic treatment draws on recent work on range measures, specialized here to temporal lag and extended to vector-valued outputs in the RL setting. Temporal Range thus offers a practical per-sequence readout of memory dependence for comparing agents and environments and for selecting the shortest sufficient context."}

Such systems can be described by non-Hermitian quantum mechanics (NHQM), where the Hamiltonian includes dissipative terms. Within NHQM, one can also formulate the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Kohn-Sham (KS) methods and, as in the conventional theory, an effective independent-particle picture is employed. The crucial observation of the present work is that even for systems that are not coupled to an environment, in the HF or KS equation a single electron is coupled to a bath of the remaining electrons which can act as an environment, opening up the possibility for the exchange of current density between the one-electron and the remaining N-1 electron system. The corresponding self-consistent states represent a new uncharted space of solutions to the HF and KS equations. We show that the additional solutions can have a physical interpretation and thus extend the range of problems HF and KS can be applied to.

Existing algorithms for finite state and action discounted RL problems address this by assuming sufficient exploration over both state and action spaces. However, this yields non-implementable algorithms and sub-optimal performance. To resolve these limitations, we introduce a new class of methods with auto-exploration, or methods that automatically explore both state and action spaces in a parameter-free way, i.e.,~without a priori knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. We present two variants: one for the tabular setting and one for linear function approximation. Under algorithm-independent assumptions on the existence of an exploring optimal policy, both methods attain $O(ε^{-2})$ sample complexity to solve to $ε$ error. Crucially, these complexities are novel since they are void of algorithm-dependent parameters seen in prior works, which may be arbitrarily large. The methods are also simple to implement because they are parameter-free and do not directly estimate the unknown parameters. These feats are achieved by new algorithmic innovations for RL, including a dynamic mixing time, a discounted state distribution for sampling, a simple robust gradient estimator, and a recent advantage gap function to certify convergence."}

We define the Bellman equation for networked RMAB and present its computational challenge due to exponentially large action and state spaces. To resolve the computational challenge, we establish the submodularity of Bellman equation and apply the hill-climbing algorithm to achieve a $1-\\frac{1}{e}$ approximation guarantee in Bellman updates.

This work diagnoses atomic-scale limitations preventing superconducting NbN/AlN/NbN JJs from reaching their full potential. Electrical measurements reveal suppressed critical current density and soft onset of quasiparticle current. However, inverse proportionality between resistance and junction area confirms homogenous barrier thickness. This isolates structural and chemical variations in electrodes and barrier as the source of performance limitation.

We show that two of the most commonly used benchmark data sets - GossipCop and PolitiFact - are poorly suited to evaluating the utility of models that use propagation structure. Specifically, these data sets exhibit shallow, ego-like graph topologies that provide little or no ability to differentiate among modeling methods. We systematically benchmark five GNN architectures against a structure-agnostic multilayer perceptron (MLP) that uses the same node features. We show that MLPs match or closely trail the performance of GNNs, with performance gaps often within 1-2% and overlapping confidence intervals. To isolate the contribution of structure in these datasets, we conduct controlled experiments where node features are shuffled or edge structures randomized. We find that performance collapses under feature shuffling but remains stable under edge randomization. This suggests that structure plays a negligible role in these benchmarks. Structural analysis further reveals that over 75% of nodes are only one hop from the root, exhibiting minimal structural diversity. In contrast, on synthetic datasets where node features are noisy and structure is informative, GNNs significantly outperform MLPs.

This involves appealing to symmetries to make a principled distinction between properties of a system which are meaningful only relative to an external reference system and properties which are meaningful without further relativization. Thus we may propose that there are always well-defined facts about what observers have observed, but there are not necessarily well-defined facts about the relations between their reference frames, so there will not always exist a joint distribution over their outcomes which can meaningfully be compared to the predictions of quantum mechanics. In addition, this approach also offers a general argument against the idea that there should be a regress of relativization."}

The standard objective used in reward modeling is the Bradley-Terry (BT) loss, which learns from pairwise data consisting of a pair of chosen and rejected responses. In this work, we analyze the per-sample gradient of BT-loss and show that its norm scales with two distinct components: (1) the difference in predicted rewards between chosen and rejected responses, which reflects the prediction error, and critically, (2) representation distance between the pair measured in the output space of the final layer. While the first term captures the intended training signal, we show that the second term can significantly impact the update magnitude and misalign learning. Specifically, pairs with small representation distance often receive vanishingly weak updates, even when misranked, while pairs with large distance receive disproportionately strong updates. This leads to gradients from large-distance pairs to overshadow those from small-distance pairs, where fine-grained distinctions are especially important. To overcome this limitation, we propose NormBT, an adaptive pair-wise normalization scheme that balances representation-driven effects and focuses learning signals on prediction error. NormBT is a lightweight, drop-in integration to BT loss with negligible overhead. Across various LLM backbones and datasets, NormBT improves reward model performance consistently, with notable gains of over 5% on the Reasoning category of RewardBench, which contains numerous small-distance pairs. This work reveals a key limitation in the widely used BT objective and provides a simple, effective correction."}

Fraud is difficult to detect because of covert tactics and the high labor and time costs of audits. Traditional statistical models are interpretable but struggle with nonlinear feature interactions, while machine learning models are powerful but often opaque. In addition, most existing methods judge fraud only for the current year based on current year data, limiting timeliness.\n  This paper proposes a financial fraud detection framework for Chinese A-share listed companies based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We design a feature engineering scheme that transforms firm-year panel data into image like representations, enabling the CNN to capture cross-sectional and temporal patterns and to predict fraud in advance. Experiments show that the CNN outperforms logistic regression and LightGBM in accuracy, robustness, and early-warning performance, and that proper tuning of the classification threshold is crucial in high-risk settings.\n  To address interpretability, we analyze the model along the dimensions of entity, feature, and time using local explanation techniques. We find that solvency, ratio structure, governance structure, and internal control are general predictors of fraud, while environmental indicators matter mainly in high-pollution industries. Non-fraud firms share stable feature patterns, whereas fraud firms exhibit heterogeneous patterns concentrated in short time windows. A case study of Guanong Shares in 2022 shows that cash flow analysis, social responsibility, governance structure, and per-share indicators are the main drivers of the model's fraud prediction, consistent with the company's documented misconduct."}

Artificial intelligence techniques, which use a neural network component in various forms, have recently frequently been used to accomplish this step.

In this paper, a method inspired by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control approach is investigated to enhance the performance of neural network models used for multi-step ahead prediction of periodic time-series information while maintaining a negligible impact on the complexity of the system. The PID-based method is applied to the predicted value at each time step to bring that value closer to the real value. The water demand forecasting problem is considered as a case study, where two deep neural network models from the literature are used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed boosting method. Furthermore, to prove the applicability of this PID-based booster to other types of periodic time-series prediction problems, it is applied to enhance the accuracy of a neural network model used for multi-step forecasting of hourly energy consumption.

Because BC monitoring is typically performed using costly and specialized instruments. there is little to no available data on BC from local traffic sources that could help inform policy interventions targeting local factors. By contrast, traffic monitoring systems are widely deployed in cities around the world, highlighting the imbalance between what we know about traffic conditions and what do not know about their environmental consequences. To bridge this gap, we propose a machine learning-driven system that extracts visual information from traffic video to capture vehicles behaviors and conditions. Combining these features with weather data, our model estimates BC at street level, achieving an R-squared value of 0.72 and RMSE of 129.42 ng/m3 (nanogram per cubic meter).

Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such shifts by adapting models dynamically during inference without requiring labeled target-domain data. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Test-Time Training (AdaTTT), an enhanced TTT framework tailored for EHR-based IMV prediction in ICU settings. We begin by deriving information-theoretic bounds on the test-time prediction error and demonstrate that it is constrained by the uncertainty between the main and auxiliary tasks. To enhance their alignment, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework with pretext tasks: reconstruction and masked feature modeling optimized through a dynamic masking strategy that emphasizes features critical to the main task. Additionally, to improve robustness against domain shifts, we incorporate prototype learning and employ Partial Optimal Transport (POT) for flexible, partial feature alignment while maintaining clinically meaningful patient representations.

However, spin qubit devices face a key architectural bottleneck: the large physical footprint of readout components relative to qubits prevents a dense layout where all qubits can be measured simultaneously, complicating the implementation of quantum error correction. This challenge is offset by the platform's unique rapid shuttling capability, which can be used to transport qubits to distant readout ports. In this work, we explore the design constraints and capabilities of spin qubits in silicon and propose the SNAQ (Shuttling-capable Narrow Array of spin Qubits) surface code architecture, which relaxes the 1:1 readout-to-qubit assumption by leveraging spin shuttling to time-multiplex ancilla qubit initialization and readout. Our analysis shows that, given sufficiently high (experimentally demonstrated) qubit coherence times, SNAQ delivers an orders-of-magnitude reduction in chip area per logical qubit. Additionally, by using a denser grid of physical qubits, SNAQ enables fast transversal logic for short-distance logical operations, achieving 4.0-22.3x improvement in local logical clock speed while still supporting global operations via lattice surgery. This translates to a 57-60% reduction in spacetime cost of 15-to-1 magic state distillation, a key fault-tolerant subroutine. Our work pinpoints critical hardware metrics and provides a compelling path toward high-performance fault-tolerant computation on near-term-manufacturable spin qubit arrays."}

Many defenses are typically either black-box guardrails that filter outputs, or internals-based methods that steer hidden activations by operationalizing safety as a single latent feature or dimension. While effective for simple concepts, this assumption is limiting, as recent evidence shows that abstract concepts such as refusal and temporality are distributed across multiple features rather than isolated in one. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders (GSAEs), which extends SAEs with a Laplacian smoothness penalty on the neuron co-activation graph. Unlike standard SAEs that assign each concept to a single latent feature, GSAEs recover smooth, distributed safety representations as coherent patterns spanning multiple features. We empirically demonstrate that GSAE enables effective runtime safety steering, assembling features into a weighted set of safety-relevant directions and controlling them with a two-stage gating mechanism that activates interventions only when harmful prompts or continuations are detected during generation. This approach enforces refusals adaptively while preserving utility on benign queries. Across safety and QA benchmarks, GSAE steering achieves an average 82% selective refusal rate, substantially outperforming standard SAE steering (42%), while maintaining strong task accuracy (70% on TriviaQA, 65% on TruthfulQA, 74% on GSM8K). Robustness experiments further show generalization across LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi families and resilience against jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN), consistently maintaining >= 90% refusal of harmful content."}

This leads to a classification of non-local strategies, and a tight boundary where standard self-testing do not apply and complex self-testing is necessary. We further construct a strategy involving quaternions, establishing the first standard self-test for genuinely complex strategy.

However, this procedure is difficult because real-world datasets are rarely homogeneous; they consist of a mixture of diverse information, causing gradient interference, where conflicting gradients pull the model in opposing directions, degrading performance. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to group data based on semantic or embedding similarity. However, this fails to capture how data influences model parameters during learning. While recent works have attempted to cluster gradients directly, they randomly project gradients into lower dimensions to manage memory, which leads to accuracy loss. Moreover, these methods rely on expert ensembles which necessitates multiple inference passes and expensive on-the-fly gradient computations during inference. To address these limitations, we propose GradientSpace, a framework that clusters samples directly in full-dimensional gradient space. We introduce an online SVD-based algorithm that operates on LoRA gradients to identify latent skills without the infeasible cost of storing all sample gradients. Each cluster is used to train a specialized LoRA expert along with a lightweight router trained to select the best expert during inference.

In this paper, we uncover a misalignment between original and distilled datasets, observing that a high-quality original dataset does not necessarily yield a superior synthetic dataset. Through an empirical analysis of policy performance under varying levels of training loss, we show that datasets with greater state diversity outperforms those with higher state quality when training loss is substantial, as is often the case in OBD, whereas the relationship reverses under minimal loss, which contributes to the misalignment. By associating state quality and diversity in reducing pivotal and surrounding error, respectively, our theoretical analysis establishes that surrounding error plays a more crucial role in policy performance when pivotal error is large, thereby highlighting the importance of state diversity in OBD scenario. Furthermore, we propose a novel yet simple algorithm, state density weighted (SDW) OBD, which emphasizes state diversity by weighting the distillation objective using the reciprocal of state density, thereby distilling a more diverse state information into synthetic data. Extensive experiments across multiple D4RL datasets confirm that SDW significantly enhances OBD performance when the original dataset exhibits limited state diversity."}

The stabilizer description, however, restricts the accessible noise one can incorporate into the simulation to Pauli-type noise. More general noise, including coherent errors, may have more severe impact on circuit performance than Pauli noise; yet, such general noise have been difficult to access, much less investigate fully, in numerical simulations. Here, through the use of stratified importance sampling, we show how general noise can be simulated within the stabilizer formalism in reasonable time, with non-unitary noise being nearly as cheap as Pauli noise. Unitary (or coherent) noise can require an order of magnitude more time for the simulation, but nevertheless completes in very reasonable times, a drastic improvement over past approaches that typically fail to converge altogether. Our work thus enables detailed beyond-Pauli understanding of circuit performance in the presence of real device noise, which is rarely Pauli in nature. Among other examples, we present direct simulation results for the performance of the popular rotated planar surface codes under circuit-level general noise, previously available only in limited situations and/or through mappings to efficiently simulatable physical models."}

Fraud is difficult to detect because of covert tactics and the high labor and time costs of audits. Traditional statistical models are interpretable but struggle with nonlinear feature interactions, while machine learning models are powerful but often opaque. In addition, most existing methods judge fraud only for the current year based on current year data, limiting timeliness.\n  This paper proposes a financial fraud detection framework for Chinese A-share listed companies based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We design a feature engineering scheme that transforms firm-year panel data into image like representations, enabling the CNN to capture cross-sectional and temporal patterns and to predict fraud in advance. Experiments show that the CNN outperforms logistic regression and LightGBM in accuracy, robustness, and early-warning performance, and that proper tuning of the classification threshold is crucial in high-risk settings.\n  To address interpretability, we analyze the model along the dimensions of entity, feature, and time using local explanation techniques. We find that solvency, ratio structure, governance structure, and internal control are general predictors of fraud, while environmental indicators matter mainly in high-pollution industries. Non-fraud firms share stable feature patterns, whereas fraud firms exhibit heterogeneous patterns concentrated in short time windows. A case study of Guanong Shares in 2022 shows that cash flow analysis, social responsibility, governance structure, and per-share indicators are the main drivers of the model's fraud prediction, consistent with the company's documented misconduct."}

However, we show that barren plateaus emerge in QuDDPMs due to the use of 2-design states as the input for the denoising process, which severely undermines the performance of QuDDPM. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we confirm the presence of barren plateaus in the original QuDDPM. To address this issue, we introduce an improved QuDDPM that utilizes a distribution maintaining a certain distance from the Haar distribution, ensuring better trainability. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the barren plateau problem and generates samples with higher quality, paving the way for scalable and efficient quantum generative learning."}

In this work, we introduce Adaptive Test-Time Training (AdaTTT), an enhanced TTT framework tailored for EHR-based IMV prediction in ICU settings. We begin by deriving information-theoretic bounds on the test-time prediction error and demonstrate that it is constrained by the uncertainty between the main and auxiliary tasks. To enhance their alignment, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework with pretext tasks: reconstruction and masked feature modeling optimized through a dynamic masking strategy that emphasizes features critical to the main task.

The former one is related to the existence of Lipschitz changes of variables induced by the (heat) flow. The latter one consists of the regularity of the score function in both spatial and temporal directions.\n  These assumptions are valid in the flow-based generative model associated with the Föllmer process and $1$-rectified flow under the Gaussian tail assumption.

We validate the fidelity by simulating the 53-qubit, 14-cycle Sycamore circuit and achieving a linear cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) score of 0.549, exceeding the published XEB score of 0.002 from Google's reference data.

Many defenses are typically either black-box guardrails that filter outputs, or internals-based methods that steer hidden activations by operationalizing safety as a single latent feature or dimension. While effective for simple concepts, this assumption is limiting, as recent evidence shows that abstract concepts such as refusal and temporality are distributed across multiple features rather than isolated in one. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders (GSAEs), which extends SAEs with a Laplacian smoothness penalty on the neuron co-activation graph. Unlike standard SAEs that assign each concept to a single latent feature, GSAEs recover smooth, distributed safety representations as coherent patterns spanning multiple features. We empirically demonstrate that GSAE enables effective runtime safety steering, assembling features into a weighted set of safety-relevant directions and controlling them with a two-stage gating mechanism that activates interventions only when harmful prompts or continuations are detected during generation. This approach enforces refusals adaptively while preserving utility on benign queries. Across safety and QA benchmarks, GSAE steering achieves an average 82% selective refusal rate, substantially outperforming standard SAE steering (42%), while maintaining strong task accuracy (70% on TriviaQA, 65% on TruthfulQA, 74% on GSM8K). Robustness experiments further show generalization across LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi families and resilience against jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN), consistently maintaining >= 90% refusal of harmful content."}

The optical field is split by a 90$^\\circ$ optical hybrid and measured by two balanced photodiodes to obtain both quadratures of the vacuum state simultaneously. The analog outputs are digitized using a dual-channel 12-bit analog-to-digital converter operating at a sampling rate of 3.2 GS/s per channel, and processed in real time by an FPGA implementing Toeplitz hashing for randomness extraction.

In this work, an effective method to alleviate the error at these points is proposed. It is based on extending the data by inserting virtual data within the actual data to relieve the nonlinearity around them. To our knowledge, this is the first work that considers the problem related to the extreme points.

Real data obtained from two different water plants in China are used to train and verify the model proposed. The prediction results and the comparison with the state-of-the-art illustrate that the method proposed reduces the complexity of the model six times of what achieved in the literature while conserving the same accuracy.

However, this procedure is difficult because real-world datasets are rarely homogeneous; they consist of a mixture of diverse information, causing gradient interference, where conflicting gradients pull the model in opposing directions, degrading performance. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to group data based on semantic or embedding similarity. However, this fails to capture how data influences model parameters during learning. While recent works have attempted to cluster gradients directly, they randomly project gradients into lower dimensions to manage memory, which leads to accuracy loss. Moreover, these methods rely on expert ensembles which necessitates multiple inference passes and expensive on-the-fly gradient computations during inference. To address these limitations, we propose GradientSpace, a framework that clusters samples directly in full-dimensional gradient space. We introduce an online SVD-based algorithm that operates on LoRA gradients to identify latent skills without the infeasible cost of storing all sample gradients. Each cluster is used to train a specialized LoRA expert along with a lightweight router trained to select the best expert during inference. We show that routing to a single, appropriate expert outperforms expert ensembles used in prior work, while significantly reducing inference latency.

To address this challenge, we present KV CAR, a unified and architecture agnostic framework that significantly reduces KV cache storage while maintaining model fidelity. KV CAR combines two complementary techniques. First, a lightweight autoencoder learns compact representations of key and value tensors along the embedding dimension, compressing them before they are stored in the KV cache and restoring them upon retrieval. Second, a similarity driven reuse mechanism identifies opportunities to reuse KV tensors of specific attention heads across adjacent layers. Together, these methods reduce the dimensional and structural redundancy in KV tensors without requiring changes to the transformer architecture. Evaluations on GPT 2 and TinyLLaMA models across Wikitext, C4, PIQA, and Winogrande datasets demonstrate that KV CAR achieves up to 47.85 percent KV cache memory reduction with minimal impact on perplexity and zero shot accuracy. System level measurements on an NVIDIA A40 GPU show that the reduced KV footprint directly translates into longer sequence lengths and larger batch sizes during inference. These results highlight the effectiveness of KV CAR in enabling memory efficient LLM inference."}

While so-called non-Markovian dynamics is common in larger systems with interacting components, observations in fundamental physical systems have been confined to specifically engineered cases. Here, we report the experimental observation of non-Markovian dynamics in an elemental material, crystalline cobalt. By driving this material with an intense terahertz electromagnetic field, we bring its magnetisation into a non-equilibrium state and follow its evolution. We measure the sample's low temperature magnetic response in the time domain which leads to an unexpectedly rich multi-peaked spectrum in the Fourier domain, that cannot be explained by established models. We use open quantum system theory, which predicts a non-Markovian memory kernel in the dynamical equations to capture the fundamental interaction between the spin system and the phonon bath. Simulations based on this theory produce a multi-peaked spectrum, which matches the measured one. Our non-Markovian approach is also able to reproduce the modification of the spectrum at higher temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovian effects are observable at a much more fundamental level than previously thought, opening the door to their exploration and control in a broad range of condensed matter systems."}

Deep learning (DL) approaches provide the most accurate solutions for this purpose. However, they suffer from complexity problem due to the massive number of parameters, in addition to the high forecasting error at the extreme points. In this work, an effective method to alleviate the error at these points is proposed. It is based on extending the data by inserting virtual data within the actual data to relieve the nonlinearity around them. To our knowledge, this is the first work that considers the problem related to the extreme points. Moreover, the water demand forecasting model proposed in this work is a novel DL model with relatively low complexity. The basic model uses the gated recurrent unit (GRU) to handle the sequential relationship in the historical demand data, while an unsupervised classification method, K-means, is introduced for the creation of new features to enhance the prediction accuracy with less number of parameters. Real data obtained from two different water plants in China are used to train and verify the model proposed. The prediction results and the comparison with the state-of-the-art illustrate that the method proposed reduces the complexity of the model six times of what achieved in the literature while conserving the same accuracy. Furthermore, it is found that extending the data set significantly reduces the error by about 30%. However, it increases the training time."}

The scattering spectra and the conversion contrast are studied in both the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes.

Altering the photon number $n$ induces the non-reciprocal transmission of single photons in the waveguide, hence, enhance the conversion probability."}

As a case study, we first mainly focus on the specific question of whether the Hamiltonian can uniquely determine a tensor product structure, a crucial challenge in the growing field of quantum mereology. The present paper reviews, clarifies, and critically examines two apparently conflicting theorems by Cotler et al. and Stoica. We resolve the tension, show how the former has been widely misinterpreted and why the latter is correct only in some weaker version. We then propose a correct mathematical way to address the general problem of preferred structures in quantum theory, relative to the characterization of emergent objects by unitary-invariant properties. Finally, we apply this formalism in the particular case we started with, and show that a Hamiltonian and a state are enough structure to uniquely select a preferred tensor product structure."}

A significant challenge is translating application-level requests into the concrete instructions executable at lower layers. In this work, we introduce a RuleSet-based framework that explicitly incorporates the application layer into the layered architecture of the Quantum Internet. Our framework builds on a RuleSet-based protocol, clarifying communication procedures, organizing application request information, and introducing new Rules for application execution by embedding application specifications into RuleSets.

While data-driven methods have advanced predictive modeling for forward design, inverse design, which focuses on determining mix compositions that achieve target performance, remains limited, particularly in design situations where some mix variables are fixed by constraints and only the remaining variables must be determined. This study proposes a cooperative neural network framework for the partial inverse design of high-performance concrete. The framework combines two coupled neural network models, an imputation model that infers the undetermined variables and a surrogate model that predicts compressive strength. Through cooperative learning, the model generates valid and performance-consistent mix designs in a single forward pass while accommodating different constraint combinations without retraining. Its performance is compared with both probabilistic and generative approaches, including Bayesian inference based on a Gaussian process surrogate and autoencoder-based models. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the proposed model achieves stable and higher R-squared values of 0.87-0.92 and reduces mean squared error by an average of 50 percent compared with autoencoder baselines and by an average of 70 percent compared with Bayesian inference.

Since market participants are usually uncertain about their preferences in various online matching platforms, an emerging line of research is dedicated to the online setting where one-side participants (players) learn their unknown preferences through multiple rounds of interactions with the other side (arms). Sankararaman et al. provide an $Ω\\left( \\frac{N\\log(T)}{Δ^2} + \\frac{K\\log(T)}Δ \\right)$ regret lower bound for this problem under serial dictatorship assumption, where $N$ is the number of players, $K (\\geq N)$ is the number of arms, $Δ$ is the minimum reward gap across players and arms, and $T$ is the time horizon. Serial dictatorship assumes arms have the same preferences, which is common in reality when one side participants have a unified evaluation standard. Recently, the work of Kong and Li proposes the ET-GS algorithm and achieves an $O\\left( \\frac{K\\log(T)}{Δ^2} \\right)$ regret upper bound, which is the best upper bound attained so far. Nonetheless, a gap between the lower and upper bounds, ranging from $N$ to $K$, persists. It remains unclear whether the lower bound or the upper bound needs to be improved.

In classical star networks, such mediated coupling gives rise to remote synchronization--where nonadjacent leaf nodes synchronize through a nonsynchronous hub--and to explosive synchronization, characterized by an abrupt collective transition to coherence. In the quantum regime, analogous effects can arise from the interplay between 1:1 phase locking and 2:1 phase-locking blockade in coupled spin-1 oscillators. In this work, we investigate a star network composed of spin-1 oscillators. For identical oscillators, symmetric and asymmetric dissipation lead to distinct transmission behaviors: remote synchronization and quasi-explosive synchronization appear in different coupling regimes, a phenomenon absent in classical counterparts. For nonidentical networks, we find that at large detuning remote synchronization emerges in the weak-coupling regime and evolves into quasi-explosive synchronization as the coupling increases, consistent with classical star-network dynamics. These findings reveal the rich dynamical characteristics of mediated quantum synchronization and point toward new possibilities for exploring synchronization transmission in larger and more complex quantum systems."}

A diverse dataset of 105,000 URLs was curated from PhishTank, OpenPhish, Cloudflare, and other sources, and the model was evaluated using an 80/20 train-test split. The QR-DQN framework achieved a test accuracy of 99.86%, precision of 99.75%, recall of 99.96%, and F1-score of 99.85%, demonstrating high effectiveness. Compared to standard DQN with lexical features, the hybrid QR-DQN with lexical and semantic features reduced the generalization gap from 1.66% to 0.04%, indicating significant improvement in robustness.

Among these, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architectures are particularly effective in capturing complex temporal dependencies. However, the robustness and generalization of such models are highly sensitive to input data characteristics - an aspect that remains underexplored in existing literature. This study presents a systematic empirical analysis of two key data-centric factors: input sequence length and additive noise. To support this investigation, a modular and reproducible forecasting pipeline is developed, incorporating standardized preprocessing, sequence generation, model training, validation, and evaluation. Controlled experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets with varying sampling frequencies to assess BiLSTM performance under different input conditions. The results yield three key findings: (1) longer input sequences significantly increase the risk of overfitting and data leakage, particularly in data-constrained environments; (2) additive noise consistently degrades predictive accuracy across sampling frequencies; and (3) the simultaneous presence of both factors results in the most substantial decline in model stability. While datasets with higher observation frequencies exhibit greater robustness, they remain vulnerable when both input challenges are present. These findings highlight important limitations in current DL-based forecasting pipelines and underscore the need for data-aware design strategies.

A lightweight prediction head generates multi horizon forecasts, and a denormalization mechanism reconstructs outputs by reintegrating local trends to ensure robustness under varying temporal conditions. AdaMamba provides strong representational capacity with modular extensibility, supporting deterministic prediction and compatibility with probabilistic extensions. Its design effectively mitigates covariate shift and enhances predictive reliability across heterogeneous datasets. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AdaMamba's combination of adaptive normalization and expert augmented contextual modeling yields consistent improvements in stability and accuracy over conventional Transformer based baselines."}

We introduce Small-Gain Nash (SGN), a block small-gain condition in a custom block-weighted geometry. SGN converts local curvature and cross-player Lipschitz coupling bounds into a tractable certificate of contraction. It constructs a weighted block metric in which the pseudo-gradient becomes strongly monotone on any region where these bounds hold, even when it is non-monotone in the Euclidean sense. The continuous flow is exponentially contracting in this designed geometry, and projected Euler and RK4 discretizations converge under explicit step-size bounds derived from the SGN margin and a local Lipschitz constant. Our analysis reveals a certified ``timescale band'', a non-asymptotic, metric-based certificate that plays a TTUR-like role: rather than forcing asymptotic timescale separation via vanishing, unequal step sizes, SGN identifies a finite band of relative metric weights for which a single-step-size dynamics is provably contractive. We validate the framework on quadratic games where Euclidean monotonicity analysis fails to predict convergence, but SGN successfully certifies it, and extend the construction to mirror/Fisher geometries for entropy-regularized policy gradient in Markov games. The result is an offline certification pipeline that estimates curvature, coupling, and Lipschitz parameters on compact regions, optimizes block weights to enlarge the SGN margin, and returns a structural, computable convergence certificate consisting of a metric, contraction rate, and safe step-sizes for non-monotone games."}

However, evaluation integrity is often compromised by data leakage, a methodological flaw in which input-output sequences are constructed before dataset partitioning, allowing future information to unintentionally influence training. This study investigates the impact of data leakage on performance, focusing on how validation design mediates leakage sensitivity. Three widely used validation techniques (2-way split, 3-way split, and 10-fold cross-validation) are evaluated under both leaky (pre-split sequence generation) and clean conditions, with the latter mitigating leakage risk by enforcing temporal separation during data splitting prior to sequence construction. The effect of leakage is assessed using RMSE Gain, which measures the relative increase in RMSE caused by leakage, computed as the percentage difference between leaky and clean setups. Empirical results show that 10-fold cross-validation exhibits RMSE Gain values of up to 20.5% at extended lag steps. In contrast, 2-way and 3-way splits demonstrate greater robustness, typically maintaining RMSE Gain below 5% across diverse configurations. Moreover, input window size and lag step significantly influence leakage sensitivity: smaller windows and longer lags increase the risk of leakage, whereas larger windows help reduce it. These findings underscore the need for configuration-aware, leakage-resistant evaluation pipelines to ensure reliable performance estimation."}

While data-driven methods have advanced predictive modeling for forward design, inverse design, which focuses on determining mix compositions that achieve target performance, remains limited, particularly in design situations where some mix variables are fixed by constraints and only the remaining variables must be determined. This study proposes a cooperative neural network framework for the partial inverse design of high-performance concrete. The framework combines two coupled neural network models, an imputation model that infers the undetermined variables and a surrogate model that predicts compressive strength. Through cooperative learning, the model generates valid and performance-consistent mix designs in a single forward pass while accommodating different constraint combinations without retraining. Its performance is compared with both probabilistic and generative approaches, including Bayesian inference based on a Gaussian process surrogate and autoencoder-based models. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the proposed model achieves stable and higher R-squared values of 0.87-0.92 and reduces mean squared error by an average of 50 percent compared with autoencoder baselines and by an average of 70 percent compared with Bayesian inference. The results demonstrate that the cooperative neural network provides an accurate, robust, and computationally efficient foundation for constraint-aware, data-driven mix proportioning in concrete engineering."}

Quantum expectation values are usually calculated via Hilbert space inner products and, thereby, differently from expectation values in classical mechanics, which are weighted phase-space integrals. It is shown that, by using Anti-Wick quantization to associate dynamical variables with self-adjoint linear operators, quantum expectation values can be interpreted as genuine weighted averages over phase space, paralleling their classical counterparts. This interpretation arises naturally in the Segal-Bargmann space, where creation and annihilation operators act as simple multiplication and differentiation operators. In this setting, the Husimi Q-function - the coherent-state representation of the quantum state - can be seen as a true probability density in phase space. Unlike Bohmian mechanics, the present approach retains the standard correspondence between dynamical variables and self-adjoint operators while paving the way for a classical-like probabilistic interpretation of quantum statistics."}

While there has been substantial work on ensuring AI fairness, navigating trade-offs between competing notions of fairness as well as predictive accuracy remains challenging, creating barriers to the practical deployment of fair AI systems. To address this, we introduce a unifying human-centered fairness framework that systematically covers eight distinct fairness metrics, formed by combining individual and group fairness, infra-marginal and intersectional assumptions, and outcome-based and equality-of-opportunity (EOO) perspectives. This structure allows stakeholders to align fairness interventions with their values and contextual considerations. The framework uses a consistent and easy-to-understand formulation for all metrics to reduce the learning curve for non-experts. Rather than privileging a single fairness notion, the framework enables stakeholders to assign weights across multiple fairness objectives, reflecting their priorities and facilitating multi-stakeholder compromises. We apply this approach to four real-world datasets: the UCI Adult census dataset for income prediction, the COMPAS dataset for criminal recidivism, the German Credit dataset for credit risk assessment, and the MEPS dataset for healthcare utilization. We show that adjusting weights reveals nuanced trade-offs between different fairness metrics. Finally, through case studies in judicial decision-making and healthcare, we demonstrate how the framework can inform practical and value-sensitive deployment of fair AI systems."}

The traditional diagnostic methods are facing the challenge of insufficient diagnostic accuracy under complex conditions. To solve these problems, we propose a novel Neural Factorization-based Classification (NFC) framework for bearing fault diagnosis. It is built on two core idea: 1) Embedding vibration time series into multiple mode-wise latent feature vectors to capture diverse fault-related patterns; 2) Leveraging neural factorization principles to fuse these vectors into a unified vibration representation. This design enables effective mining of complex latent fault characteristics from raw time-series data. We further instantiate the framework with two models CP-NFC and Tucker-NFC based on CP and Tucker fusion schemes, respectively. Experimental results show that both models achieve superior diagnostic performance compared with traditional machine learning methods. The comparative analysis provides valuable empirical evidence and practical guidance for selecting effective diagnostic strategies in high-speed train bearing monitoring."}

OGR performs regression of gradients against positions using an exponential moving average to estimate second derivatives online, without requiring Hessian inversion.

A key component of trust is explainability, yet much of the work in Explainable RL (XRL) focuses on local, single-step decisions. This paper addresses the critical need for explaining an agent's long-term behavior through trajectory-level analysis. We introduce a novel framework that ranks entire trajectories by defining and aggregating a new state-importance metric. This metric combines the classic Q-value difference with a \"radical term\" that captures the agent's affinity to reach its goal, providing a more nuanced measure of state criticality. We demonstrate that our method successfully identifies optimal trajectories from a heterogeneous collection of agent experiences. Furthermore, by generating counterfactual rollouts from critical states within these trajectories, we show that the agent's chosen path is robustly superior to alternatives, thereby providing a powerful \"Why this, and not that?\" explanation. Our experiments in standard OpenAI Gym environments validate that our proposed importance metric is more effective at identifying optimal behaviors compared to classic approaches, offering a significant step towards trustworthy autonomous systems."}

The design is based on a charger and a battery, which are coherently coupled and jointly interact with a bad cavity. By introducing the auxiliary bad cavity and exploiting the nonreciprocal condition, this model can harness the environmental dissipation to suppress the reverse energy transfer. Under resonant conditions, we have achieved a four ratio of the battery energy to the charger energy; in contrast, this ratio is significantly reduced under large detuning. Through damping optimization, high efficiency of the short-time charging power is attained. In comparison to the fully nonreciprocal scheme, the QB operating at the exceptional point (EP) exhibits greater resilience to parameter fluctuations.

We employ a self-supervised, joint-embedding pre-training stage to create an ECG representation that is enriched with contextual clinical information, while only requiring the ECG signal at inference time. Furthermore, as an indirect way to explain the model's output we train it to also predict associated laboratory abnormalities directly from the ECG embedding.

We further employ information-theoretic measures to assess the informativeness of pretraining signals and connect them to empirically benchmarked downstream performance. Our findings reveal a surprising insight: sophisticated masking distributions offer no consistent benefit over uniform sampling for common node-level prediction tasks.

However, the robustness and generalization of such models are highly sensitive to input data characteristics - an aspect that remains underexplored in existing literature. This study presents a systematic empirical analysis of two key data-centric factors: input sequence length and additive noise. To support this investigation, a modular and reproducible forecasting pipeline is developed, incorporating standardized preprocessing, sequence generation, model training, validation, and evaluation. Controlled experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets with varying sampling frequencies to assess BiLSTM performance under different input conditions. The results yield three key findings: (1) longer input sequences significantly increase the risk of overfitting and data leakage, particularly in data-constrained environments; (2) additive noise consistently degrades predictive accuracy across sampling frequencies; and (3) the simultaneous presence of both factors results in the most substantial decline in model stability. While datasets with higher observation frequencies exhibit greater robustness, they remain vulnerable when both input challenges are present. These findings highlight important limitations in current DL-based forecasting pipelines and underscore the need for data-aware design strategies.

This study propose AdaMamba, a unified forecasting architecture that integrates adaptive normalization, multi scale trend extraction, and contextual sequence modeling to address these challenges. AdaMamba begins with an Adaptive Normalization Block that removes non stationary components through multi scale convolutional trend extraction and channel wise recalibration, enabling consistent detrending and variance stabilization. The normalized sequence is then processed by a Context Encoder that combines patch wise embeddings, positional encoding, and a Mamba enhanced Transformer layer with a mixture of experts feed forward module, allowing efficient modeling of both long range dependencies and local temporal dynamics. A lightweight prediction head generates multi horizon forecasts, and a denormalization mechanism reconstructs outputs by reintegrating local trends to ensure robustness under varying temporal conditions. AdaMamba provides strong representational capacity with modular extensibility, supporting deterministic prediction and compatibility with probabilistic extensions. Its design effectively mitigates covariate shift and enhances predictive reliability across heterogeneous datasets. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AdaMamba's combination of adaptive normalization and expert augmented contextual modeling yields consistent improvements in stability and accuracy over conventional Transformer based baselines."}

In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures."}

Prevailing alignment methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), rely on stochastic weight updates that often incur an \"alignment tax\" -- degrading general reasoning capabilities.\n  Methods: We propose the Soul Engine, a framework based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis, which posits that personality traits exist as orthogonal linear subspaces. We introduce SoulBench, a dataset constructed via dynamic contextual sampling. Using a dual-head architecture on a frozen Qwen-2.5 base, we extract disentangled personality vectors without modifying the backbone weights.\n  Results: Our experiments demonstrate three breakthroughs. First, High-Precision Profiling: The model achieves a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.011 against psychological ground truth. Second, Geometric Orthogonality: T-SNE visualization confirms that personality manifolds are distinct and continuous, allowing for \"Zero-Shot Personality Injection\" that maintains original model intelligence.

However, evaluation integrity is often compromised by data leakage, a methodological flaw in which input-output sequences are constructed before dataset partitioning, allowing future information to unintentionally influence training. This study investigates the impact of data leakage on performance, focusing on how validation design mediates leakage sensitivity. Three widely used validation techniques (2-way split, 3-way split, and 10-fold cross-validation) are evaluated under both leaky (pre-split sequence generation) and clean conditions, with the latter mitigating leakage risk by enforcing temporal separation during data splitting prior to sequence construction. The effect of leakage is assessed using RMSE Gain, which measures the relative increase in RMSE caused by leakage, computed as the percentage difference between leaky and clean setups. Empirical results show that 10-fold cross-validation exhibits RMSE Gain values of up to 20.5% at extended lag steps. In contrast, 2-way and 3-way splits demonstrate greater robustness, typically maintaining RMSE Gain below 5% across diverse configurations. Moreover, input window size and lag step significantly influence leakage sensitivity: smaller windows and longer lags increase the risk of leakage, whereas larger windows help reduce it. These findings underscore the need for configuration-aware, leakage-resistant evaluation pipelines to ensure reliable performance estimation."}

Once the decision is made on the occurrence of a downward switch, the main cavity mode is let to freely decay to the vacuum, monitored to the production of an integrated charge. In the long-time limit, the charge distribution over an identical collection of pure states generated during the jumps converges to the Q function (heterodyne detection) or marginals of the Wigner function (homodyne detection) dictated by the phase of the local oscillator.

While there has been substantial work on ensuring AI fairness, navigating trade-offs between competing notions of fairness as well as predictive accuracy remains challenging, creating barriers to the practical deployment of fair AI systems. To address this, we introduce a unifying human-centered fairness framework that systematically covers eight distinct fairness metrics, formed by combining individual and group fairness, infra-marginal and intersectional assumptions, and outcome-based and equality-of-opportunity (EOO) perspectives. This structure allows stakeholders to align fairness interventions with their values and contextual considerations. The framework uses a consistent and easy-to-understand formulation for all metrics to reduce the learning curve for non-experts. Rather than privileging a single fairness notion, the framework enables stakeholders to assign weights across multiple fairness objectives, reflecting their priorities and facilitating multi-stakeholder compromises. We apply this approach to four real-world datasets: the UCI Adult census dataset for income prediction, the COMPAS dataset for criminal recidivism, the German Credit dataset for credit risk assessment, and the MEPS dataset for healthcare utilization. We show that adjusting weights reveals nuanced trade-offs between different fairness metrics. Finally, through case studies in judicial decision-making and healthcare, we demonstrate how the framework can inform practical and value-sensitive deployment of fair AI systems."}

Here, we theoretically propose and demonstrate a scheme for generating non-Gaussian mechanical states using a strongly driven hybrid system that combines cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and cavity optomechanics. Our protocol prepares a non-Gaussian cavity state in the dispersive regime of cavity QED and subsequently transfers it to a mechanical oscillator using the optomechanical interaction enhanced by a coherent cavity drive. While non-Gaussian cavity state control in cavity QED is well established in the dispersive regime, its behavior under strong cavity drive, essential for cavity optomechanics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we develop an efficient simulation framework to model cavity QED dynamics in the high-photon-number regime. We show that a strong cavity drive can coherently displace the cavity state with minimal perturbations, effectively decoupling it from the qubit. The resulting large coherent cavity field enhances the optomechanical coupling strength, enabling high-fidelity transfer of non-Gaussian cavity states to the mechanical mode. These results reveal new dynamical features of driven cavity QED and open a pathway toward realizing non-Gaussian mechanical quantum memories and sensors."}

However, state-of-the-art methods of drawing these tickets, like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), are computationally prohibitive, while more efficient saliency-based Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI) techniques suffer from a significant accuracy-sparsity trade-off and fail basic sanity checks. In this work, we argue that PaI's reliance on first-order saliency metrics, which ignore inter-weight dependencies, contributes substantially to this performance gap, especially in the sparse regime. To address this, we introduce Concrete Ticket Search (CTS), an algorithm that frames subnetwork discovery as a holistic combinatorial optimization problem. By leveraging a Concrete relaxation of the discrete search space and a novel gradient balancing scheme (GRADBALANCE) to control sparsity, CTS efficiently identifies high-performing subnetworks near initialization without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning. Motivated by recent works on lottery ticket training dynamics, we further propose a knowledge distillation-inspired family of pruning objectives, finding that minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sparse and dense network outputs (CTS-KL) is particularly effective. Experiments on varying image classification tasks show that CTS produces subnetworks that robustly pass sanity checks and achieve accuracy comparable to or exceeding LTR, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation. For example, on ResNet-20 on CIFAR10, it reaches 99.3% sparsity with 74.0% accuracy in 7.9 minutes, while LTR attains the same sparsity with 68.3% accuracy in 95.2 minutes. CTS's subnetworks outperform saliency-based methods across all sparsities, but its advantage over LTR is most pronounced in the highly sparse regime."}

OGR performs regression of gradients against positions using an exponential moving average to estimate second derivatives online, without requiring Hessian inversion. Unlike BFGS, OGR allows estimation of a general (not necessarily positive definite) Hessian and can thus handle non-convex structures. We evaluate both methods across standard test functions and demonstrate that OGR achieves faster convergence and improved loss, particularly in non-convex settings."}

This paper proposes LUNA, a fast and efficient superconducting qubit readout accelerator that combines low-cost integrator-based preprocessing with Look-Up Table (LUT) based neural networks for classification. The architecture uses simple integrators for dimensionality reduction with minimal hardware overhead, and employs LogicNets (DNNs synthesized into LUT logic) to drastically reduce resource usage while enabling ultra-low-latency inference. We integrate this with a differential evolution based exploration and optimization framework to identify high-quality design points. Our results show up to a 10.95x reduction in area and 30% lower latency with little to no loss in fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art.

For RW-AdaBatch, we exploit the limited-switching behavior induced by LDP to provide a novel form of privacy amplification that grows stronger on easier data, analogous to the shuffle model in offline learning. Drawing on the theory of random walks, we prove that this improvement carries essentially no utility cost. For RW-Meta, we develop a general method for privately selecting between experts that are themselves non-trivial learning algorithms, and we show that in the context of LDP this carries no extra privacy cost.

The action of a quantum channel usually introduces noise in the quantum state and thereby reduces the information contained in it. Concatenating a quantum channel with another quantum channel makes it more noisy and degrades its information and resource preservability. These are mathematically described by completely positive trace-preserving linear maps that represent the generic evolution of quantum systems. These are special cases of Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. In this work, we demonstrate a physically meaningful way to compare a pair of quantum channels using Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. More precisely, given a pair of quantum channels and an arbitrary unknown input state, we show that if the output state of one quantum channel from the pair can be obtained from the output statistics of the other channel from the pair using some quantum measurement, then the latter channel from the pair can be obtained from the former channel by concatenating it with a Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear map. This relation between these two channels is a preorder, and we try to study its characterization in this work.

Therefore, we propose a pre-processing method IFFair based on the influence function. Compared with other fairness optimization approaches, IFFair only uses the influence disparity of training samples on different groups as a guidance to dynamically adjust the sample weights during training without modifying the network structure, data features and decision boundaries. To evaluate the validity of IFFair, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets and metrics. The experimental results show that our approach mitigates bias of multiple accepted metrics in the classification setting, including demographic parity, equalized odds, equality of opportunity and error rate parity without conflicts. It also demonstrates that IFFair achieves better trade-off between multiple utility and fairness metrics compared with previous pre-processing methods."}

In this paper, we introduce OXtal, a large-scale 100M parameter all-atom diffusion model that directly learns the conditional joint distribution over intramolecular conformations and periodic packing. To efficiently scale OXtal, we abandon explicit equivariant architectures imposing inductive bias arising from crystal symmetries in favor of data augmentation strategies.

While reusing past experience is natural, current LLM agents either treat entire trajectories or pre-defined subtasks as indivisible units, or solely exploit tool-to-tool dependencies, hindering adaptation as states and information evolve across turns. In this paper, we propose a State Integrated Tool Graph (SIT-Graph), which enhances multi-turn tool use by exploiting partially overlapping experience. Inspired by human decision-making that integrates episodic and procedural memory, SIT-Graph captures both compact state representations (episodic-like fragments) and tool-to-tool dependencies (procedural-like routines) from historical trajectories. Specifically, we first build a tool graph from accumulated tool-use sequences, and then augment each edge with a compact state summary of the dialog and tool history that may shape the next action. At inference time, SIT-Graph enables a human-like balance between episodic recall and procedural execution: when the next decision requires recalling prior context, the agent retrieves the state summaries stored on relevant edges and uses them to guide its next action; when the step is routine, it follows high-confidence tool dependencies without explicit recall. Experiments across multiple stateful multi-turn tool-use benchmarks show that SIT-Graph consistently outperforms strong memory- and graph-based baselines, delivering more robust tool selection and more effective experience transfer."}

While multi-head mechanisms enhance expressivity in attention, naively applying them to FFNs faces two challenges: memory consumption scaling with the head count, and an imbalanced ratio between the growing intermediate size and the fixed head dimension as models scale, which degrades scalability and expressive power. To address these challenges, we propose Flash Multi-Head FFN (FlashMHF), with two key innovations: an I/O-aware fused kernel computing outputs online in SRAM akin to FlashAttention, and a design using dynamically weighted parallel sub-networks to maintain a balanced ratio between intermediate and head dimensions. Validated on models from 128M to 1.3B parameters, FlashMHF consistently improves perplexity and downstream task accuracy over SwiGLU FFNs, while reducing peak memory usage by 3-5x and accelerating inference by up to 1.08x. Our work establishes the multi-head design as a superior architectural principle for FFNs, presenting FlashMHF as a powerful, efficient, and scalable alternative to FFNs in Transformers."}

In this work, we report that an ill-chosen reference state can induce spurious long-range strange correlators in trivial SPT phases, leading to false positives in SPT diagnosis. Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators."}

Existing methods place all entities on one homogeneous manifold, Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic, or their product/multi-curvature variants, to model linear, symmetric, or hierarchical patterns. Yet a predefined, homogeneous manifold cannot accommodate the sharply varying curvature that real-world graphs exhibit across local regions. Since this geometry is imposed a priori, any mismatch with the knowledge graph's local curvatures will distort distances between entities and hurt the expressiveness of the resulting KGE. To rectify this, we propose RicciKGE to have the KGE loss gradient coupled with local curvatures in an extended Ricci flow such that entity embeddings co-evolve dynamically with the underlying manifold geometry towards mutual adaptation. Theoretically, when the coupling coefficient is bounded and properly selected, we rigorously prove that i) all the edge-wise curvatures decay exponentially, meaning that the manifold is driven toward the Euclidean flatness; and ii) the KGE distances strictly converge to a global optimum, which indicates that geometric flattening and embedding optimization are promoting each other. Experimental improvements on link prediction and node classification benchmarks demonstrate RicciKGE's effectiveness in adapting to heterogeneous knowledge graph structures."}

The main driver of our unlearning methods is the similarity of predictions to a retrained model on both the forget and remain samples. We introduce Adversarial Machine UNlearning (AMUN), which surpasses prior state-of-the-art methods for image classification based on SOTA MIA scores. AMUN lowers the model's confidence on forget samples by fine-tuning on their corresponding adversarial examples. Through theoretical analysis, we identify factors governing AMUN's performance, including smoothness. To facilitate training of smooth models with a controlled Lipschitz constant, we propose FastClip, a scalable method that performs layer-wise spectral-norm clipping of affine layers. In a separate study, we show that increased smoothness naturally improves adversarial example transfer, thereby supporting the second factor above.\n  Following the same principles for class unlearning, we show that existing methods fail in replicating a retrained model's behavior by introducing a nearest-neighbor membership inference attack (MIA-NN) that uses the probabilities assigned to neighboring classes to detect unlearned samples and demonstrate the vulnerability of such methods. We then propose a fine-tuning objective that mitigates this leakage by approximating, for forget-class inputs, the distribution over remaining classes that a model retrained from scratch would produce. To construct this approximation, we estimate inter-class similarity and tilt the target model's distribution accordingly. The resulting Tilted ReWeighting(TRW) distribution serves as the desired target during fine-tuning. Across multiple benchmarks, TRW matches or surpasses existing unlearning methods on prior metrics."}

QuDDPM is capable of efficiently learning and generating quantum data, and it demonstrates excellent performance in learning correlated quantum noise models, quantum many-body phases, and the topological structure of quantum data. However, we show that barren plateaus emerge in QuDDPMs due to the use of 2-design states as the input for the denoising process, which severely undermines the performance of QuDDPM. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we confirm the presence of barren plateaus in the original QuDDPM. To address this issue, we introduce an improved QuDDPM that utilizes a distribution maintaining a certain distance from the Haar distribution, ensuring better trainability. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the barren plateau problem and generates samples with higher quality, paving the way for scalable and efficient quantum generative learning."}

We formalize this distinction as the gap between deep feature-space and shallow classifier-level forgetting. We reveal a critical asymmetry in Experience Replay: while minimal buffers successfully anchor feature geometry and prevent deep forgetting, mitigating shallow forgetting typically requires substantially larger buffer capacities. To explain this, we extend the Neural Collapse framework to the sequential setting. We characterize deep forgetting as a geometric drift toward out-of-distribution subspaces and prove that any non-zero replay fraction asymptotically guarantees the retention of linear separability. Conversely, we identify that the \"strong collapse\" induced by small buffers leads to rank-deficient covariances and inflated class means, effectively blinding the classifier to true population boundaries. By unifying CL with out-of-distribution detection, our work challenges the prevailing reliance on large buffers, suggesting that explicitly correcting these statistical artifacts could unlock robust performance with minimal replay."}

We introduce DynamicLRP, a model-agnostic LRP framework operating at the tensor operation level. By decomposing attribution to individual operations within computation graphs and introducing a novel mechanism for deferred activation resolution, named the Promise System, our approach achieves true architecture agnosticity while maintaining LRP's theoretical guarantees. This design operates independently of backpropagation machinery, enabling operation on arbitrary computation graphs without model modification and side-by-side execution with gradient backpropagation. Being based on computation graphs, this method is theoretically extensible to other deep learning libraries that support auto-differentiation. We demonstrate faithfulness matching or exceeding specialized implementations (1.77 vs 1.69 ABPC on VGG, equivalent performance on ViT, 93.70\\% and 95.06\\% top-1 attribution accuracy for explaining RoBERTa-large and Flan-T5-large answers on SQuADv2, respectively) while maintaining practical efficiency on models with hundreds of millions of parameters.

Despite recent achievements in the realization of isolated and finite spin chains, the potential implementation in quantum devices needs the knowledge of the relaxation and decoherence sources. Our study reveals that electron spin lattice relaxation is governed at lowest temperatures by phonon-bottlenecked process and at high temperature by the chain dimerization gap. We show that the inter edge-state effective dipolar field is reduced by the intrachain exchange coupling leading to a longer coherence time than isolated ions at equivalent concentration. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the homogeneous broadening is governed by the intra-chain dipolar field, and we establish design principles for optimizing coherence in future materials."}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel MSA framework designed for domain generalization. Firstly, the framework incorporates a Mixture of Invariant Experts model to extract domain-invariant features, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to learn synergistic relationships between modalities. Secondly, we design a Cross-Modal Adapter to augment the semantic richness of multimodal representations through cross-modal knowledge injection. Extensive domain experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed MIDG achieves superior performance."}

By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators."}

We employ a self-supervised, joint-embedding pre-training stage to create an ECG representation that is enriched with contextual clinical information, while only requiring the ECG signal at inference time. Furthermore, as an indirect way to explain the model's output we train it to also predict associated laboratory abnormalities directly from the ECG embedding.

We propose an explainability-driven verifier for GNN unlearning that snapshots the model before and after deletion, using attribution shifts and localized structural changes (for example, graph edit distance) as transparent evidence. The verifier uses five explainability metrics: residual attribution, heatmap shift, explainability score deviation, graph edit distance, and a diagnostic graph rule shift.

We present Graph2Image, a framework that transforms large biological networks into sets of two-dimensional images by spatially arranging representative network nodes on a 2D grid. This transformation decouples the nodes as images, enabling the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with global receptive fields and multi-scale pyramids, thus overcoming limitations of existing biological network analysis methods in scalability, memory efficiency, and long-range context capture. Graph2Image also facilitates seamless integration with other imaging and omics modalities and enhances interpretability through direct visualization of node-associated images.

It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition."}

Building on this formalism, we conduct a controlled study of three core design dimensions: masking distribution, prediction target, and encoder architecture, under rigorously controlled settings. We further employ information-theoretic measures to assess the informativeness of pretraining signals and connect them to empirically benchmarked downstream performance. Our findings reveal a surprising insight: sophisticated masking distributions offer no consistent benefit over uniform sampling for common node-level prediction tasks. Instead, the choice of prediction target and its synergy with the encoder architecture are far more critical.

In such settings, conventional model-learning methods are fundamentally inconsistent, as the transition and reward mechanisms generated under a behavioral policy do not correspond to the interventional quantities required for evaluating a state-based policy. To address this issue, we adapt a proximal off-policy evaluation approach that identifies the confounded reward expectation using only observable state-action-reward trajectories under mild invertibility conditions on proxy variables. When combined with a behavior-averaged transition model, this construction yields a surrogate MDP whose Bellman operator is well defined and consistent for state-based policies, and which integrates seamlessly with the maximum causal entropy (MaxCausalEnt) model-learning framework. The proposed formulation enables principled model learning and planning in confounded environments where contextual information is unobserved, unavailable, or impractical to collect."}

However, state-of-the-art methods of drawing these tickets, like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), are computationally prohibitive, while more efficient saliency-based Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI) techniques suffer from a significant accuracy-sparsity trade-off and fail basic sanity checks. In this work, we argue that PaI's reliance on first-order saliency metrics, which ignore inter-weight dependencies, contributes substantially to this performance gap, especially in the sparse regime. To address this, we introduce Concrete Ticket Search (CTS), an algorithm that frames subnetwork discovery as a holistic combinatorial optimization problem. By leveraging a Concrete relaxation of the discrete search space and a novel gradient balancing scheme (GRADBALANCE) to control sparsity, CTS efficiently identifies high-performing subnetworks near initialization without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning. Motivated by recent works on lottery ticket training dynamics, we further propose a knowledge distillation-inspired family of pruning objectives, finding that minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sparse and dense network outputs (CTS-KL) is particularly effective. Experiments on varying image classification tasks show that CTS produces subnetworks that robustly pass sanity checks and achieve accuracy comparable to or exceeding LTR, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation. For example, on ResNet-20 on CIFAR10, it reaches 99.3% sparsity with 74.0% accuracy in 7.9 minutes, while LTR attains the same sparsity with 68.3% accuracy in 95.2 minutes.

The basic principle is to iteratively refine the model with real samples and synthetic ones generated from itself. However, the existing methods primarily focus on the relative gaps between the rewards for two types of data, neglecting their absolute values. Through theoretical analysis, we identify that the gap-based methods suffer from unstable evolution, due to the potentially degenerated objectives. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel self-play fine-tuning method, namely Self-PlAy via Noise Contrastive Estimation (SPACE), which leverages noise contrastive estimation to capture the real-world data distribution. Specifically, SPACE treats synthetic samples as auxiliary components, and discriminates them from the real ones in a binary classification manner. As a result, SPACE independently optimizes the absolute reward values for each type of data, ensuring a consistently meaningful objective and thereby avoiding the instability issue. Theoretically, we show that the optimal solution of the objective in SPACE aligns with the underlying distribution of real-world data, and SPACE guarantees a provably stable convergence to the optimal distribution. Empirically, we show that SPACE significantly improves the performance of LLMs over various tasks, and outperforms supervised fine-tuning that employs much more real-world samples.

Traditional methods typically employ a uniform segmentation strategy, which fails to account for varying physical constraints along roads, such as road conditions, intersections, and points of interest, thereby limiting prediction efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to efficiently and adaptively learn non-uniform road segments for arrival time prediction. Our method decouples the prediction process into two stages: 1) Non-uniform road segments are extracted based on their impact scores using the proposed RL framework; and 2) A linear prediction model is applied to the selected segments to make predictions. This method ensures optimal segment selection while maintaining computational efficiency, offering a significant improvement over traditional uniform approaches. Furthermore, our experimental results suggest that the linear approach can even achieve better performance than more complex methods.

Existing methods, focusing on aggregation or regularization, fail to address this root cause of local training bias. To this end, we propose Geometry-Guided Text Prompt Calibration (GGTPC), a novel framework that directly corrects this bias by providing clients with a global geometric prior. This prior, representing the shape of the global data distribution derived from the covariance matrix, is reconstructed on the server in a privacy-preserving manner. Clients then use a novel Geometry-Prior Calibration Layer (GPCL) to align their local feature distributions with this global prior during training. Extensive experiments show GGTPC's effectiveness. On the label-skewed CIFAR-100 dataset ($β$=0.1), it outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.15\\%. Under extreme skew ($β$=0.01), it improves upon the baseline by 9.17\\%. Furthermore, as a plug-and-play module on the domain-skewed Office-Home dataset, it boosts FedAvg's performance by 4.60\\%. These results demonstrate that GGTPC effectively mitigates data heterogeneity by correcting the fundamental local training bias, serving as a versatile module to enhance various FL algorithms."}

It could be interlinked web data or citation networks of scientific publications. The essential problem for such a data type is to determine nodes that carry greater importance than all the others, a task that markedly enhances system monitoring and management. Traditional methods to identify important nodes in networks introduce centrality measures, such as node degree or more complex PageRank. However, they consider only the network structure, neglecting the rich node attributes. Recent methods adopt neural networks capable of handling node features, but they require supervision. This work addresses the identified gap--the absence of approaches that are both unsupervised and attribute-aware--by introducing a Pipeline for Important Node Exploration (PINE). At the core of the proposed framework is an attention-based graph model that incorporates node semantic features in the learning process of identifying the structural graph properties. The PINE's node importance scores leverage the obtained attention distribution. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed PINE method on various homogeneous and heterogeneous attributed networks. As an industry-implemented system, PINE tackles the real-world challenge of unsupervised identification of key entities within large-scale enterprise graphs."}

However, the data-based pattern makes related algorithms learn and even exacerbate potential bias in samples, resulting in discriminatory decisions against certain unprivileged groups, depriving them of the rights to equal treatment, thus damaging the social well-being and hindering the development of related applications. Therefore, we propose a pre-processing method IFFair based on the influence function. Compared with other fairness optimization approaches, IFFair only uses the influence disparity of training samples on different groups as a guidance to dynamically adjust the sample weights during training without modifying the network structure, data features and decision boundaries. To evaluate the validity of IFFair, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets and metrics. The experimental results show that our approach mitigates bias of multiple accepted metrics in the classification setting, including demographic parity, equalized odds, equality of opportunity and error rate parity without conflicts. It also demonstrates that IFFair achieves better trade-off between multiple utility and fairness metrics compared with previous pre-processing methods."}

It is mainly because intent is clarified progressively and the environment evolves with each tool call. While reusing past experience is natural, current LLM agents either treat entire trajectories or pre-defined subtasks as indivisible units, or solely exploit tool-to-tool dependencies, hindering adaptation as states and information evolve across turns. In this paper, we propose a State Integrated Tool Graph (SIT-Graph), which enhances multi-turn tool use by exploiting partially overlapping experience. Inspired by human decision-making that integrates episodic and procedural memory, SIT-Graph captures both compact state representations (episodic-like fragments) and tool-to-tool dependencies (procedural-like routines) from historical trajectories. Specifically, we first build a tool graph from accumulated tool-use sequences, and then augment each edge with a compact state summary of the dialog and tool history that may shape the next action. At inference time, SIT-Graph enables a human-like balance between episodic recall and procedural execution: when the next decision requires recalling prior context, the agent retrieves the state summaries stored on relevant edges and uses them to guide its next action; when the step is routine, it follows high-confidence tool dependencies without explicit recall. Experiments across multiple stateful multi-turn tool-use benchmarks show that SIT-Graph consistently outperforms strong memory- and graph-based baselines, delivering more robust tool selection and more effective experience transfer."}

Existing methods place all entities on one homogeneous manifold, Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic, or their product/multi-curvature variants, to model linear, symmetric, or hierarchical patterns. Yet a predefined, homogeneous manifold cannot accommodate the sharply varying curvature that real-world graphs exhibit across local regions. Since this geometry is imposed a priori, any mismatch with the knowledge graph's local curvatures will distort distances between entities and hurt the expressiveness of the resulting KGE. To rectify this, we propose RicciKGE to have the KGE loss gradient coupled with local curvatures in an extended Ricci flow such that entity embeddings co-evolve dynamically with the underlying manifold geometry towards mutual adaptation. Theoretically, when the coupling coefficient is bounded and properly selected, we rigorously prove that i) all the edge-wise curvatures decay exponentially, meaning that the manifold is driven toward the Euclidean flatness; and ii) the KGE distances strictly converge to a global optimum, which indicates that geometric flattening and embedding optimization are promoting each other. Experimental improvements on link prediction and node classification benchmarks demonstrate RicciKGE's effectiveness in adapting to heterogeneous knowledge graph structures."}

In this work, we introduce Recover-to-Forget (R2F), a novel framework for efficient unlearning in LLMs based on reconstructing full-model gradient directions from low-rank LoRA adapter updates. Rather than performing backpropagation through the full model, we compute gradients with respect to LoRA parameters using multiple paraphrased prompts and train a gradient decoder to approximate the corresponding full-model gradients. To ensure applicability to larger or black-box models, the decoder is trained on a proxy model and transferred to target models. We provide a theoretical analysis of cross-model generalization and demonstrate that our method achieves effective unlearning while preserving general model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that R2F offers a scalable and lightweight alternative for unlearning in pretrained LLMs without requiring full retraining or access to internal parameters."}

In this work, we introduce LoRA-based Unlearning with Negative Examples (LUNE), a lightweight framework that performs negative-only unlearning by updating only low-rank adapters while freezing the backbone, thereby localizing edits and avoiding disruptive global changes. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), LUNE targets intermediate representations to suppress (or replace) requested knowledge with an order-of-magnitude lower compute and memory than full fine-tuning or direct weight editing. Extensive experiments on multiple factual unlearning tasks show that LUNE: (I) achieves effectiveness comparable to full fine-tuning and memory-editing methods, and (II) reduces computational cost by about an order of magnitude."}

To address these challenges, we introduce Style Invariance as a Correctness Likelihood (SICL), a framework that leverages style-invariance for robust uncertainty estimation. SICL estimates instance-wise correctness likelihood by measuring prediction consistency across style-altered variants, requiring only the model's forward pass. This makes it a plug-and-play, backpropagation-free calibration module compatible with any TTA method. Comprehensive evaluations across four baselines, five TTA methods, and two realistic scenarios with three model architecture demonstrate that SICL reduces calibration error by an average of 13 percentage points compared to conventional calibration approaches."}

We formalize this distinction as the gap between deep feature-space and shallow classifier-level forgetting. We reveal a critical asymmetry in Experience Replay: while minimal buffers successfully anchor feature geometry and prevent deep forgetting, mitigating shallow forgetting typically requires substantially larger buffer capacities. To explain this, we extend the Neural Collapse framework to the sequential setting. We characterize deep forgetting as a geometric drift toward out-of-distribution subspaces and prove that any non-zero replay fraction asymptotically guarantees the retention of linear separability. Conversely, we identify that the \"strong collapse\" induced by small buffers leads to rank-deficient covariances and inflated class means, effectively blinding the classifier to true population boundaries. By unifying CL with out-of-distribution detection, our work challenges the prevailing reliance on large buffers, suggesting that explicitly correcting these statistical artifacts could unlock robust performance with minimal replay."}

Conventional traffic management strategies, including route guidance, ramp metering, and traffic signal control, often rely on state feedback controllers, used for their simplicity and reactivity; however, they lack the adaptability required to cope with complex and time-varying traffic dynamics. This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in which each agent adaptively tunes the parameters of a state feedback traffic controller, combining the reactivity of state feedback controllers with the adaptability of reinforcement learning. By tuning parameters at a lower frequency rather than directly determining control actions at a high frequency, the reinforcement learning agents achieve improved training efficiency while maintaining adaptability to varying traffic conditions. The multi-agent structure further enhances system robustness, as local controllers can operate independently in the event of partial failures. The proposed framework is evaluated on a simulated multi-class transportation network under varying traffic conditions. Results show that the proposed multi-agent framework outperforms the no control and fixed-parameter state feedback control cases, while performing on par with the single-agent RL-based adaptive state feedback control, with a much better resilience to partial failures."}

Can we design a proxy without involving any human experts and training? In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer by proposing a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-driven Training-free Automatic Proxy (dubbed TAP) discovery framework, which reforms the design paradigm of MPQ by utilizing LLMs to find superior TAP tailored for MPQ, automatically. In addition, to bridge the gap between black-box LLMs and the tough MPQ task, we ingeniously propose simple Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) based reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' reasoning by optimizing prompts, which can construct a positive feedback loop between the LLM and the MPQ task, enabling LLMs to generate better TAP in the next evolution. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that TAP achieves state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we truly believe that our TAP will significantly contribute to the MPQ community by providing a new perspective on LLM-driven design algorithms."}

We show how hypervector encoding and similarity-based classification can propagate or even amplify such biases, and we propose a fairness-aware training framework, FairGHDC, to mitigate them. FairGHDC introduces a bias correction term, derived from a gap-based demographic-parity regularizer, and converts it into a scalar fairness factor that scales the update of the class hypervector for the ground-truth label. This enables debiasing directly in the hypervector space without modifying the graph encoder or requiring backpropagation. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairGHDC substantially reduces demographic-parity and equal-opportunity gaps while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard GNNs and fairness-aware GNNs.

We propose an explainability-driven verifier for GNN unlearning that snapshots the model before and after deletion, using attribution shifts and localized structural changes (for example, graph edit distance) as transparent evidence. The verifier uses five explainability metrics: residual attribution, heatmap shift, explainability score deviation, graph edit distance, and a diagnostic graph rule shift. We evaluate two backbones (GCN, GAT) and four unlearning strategies (Retrain, GraphEditor, GNNDelete, IDEA) across five benchmarks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Coauthor-CS, Coauthor-Physics).

To address this issue, we propose a unified optimization framework based on consensus structure. This framework is not only applicable to various loss functions and combined regularization terms but can also be effectively extended to non-convex regularization terms, showing strong scalability. Based on this framework, we develop a distributed parallel alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to efficiently compute CR-SVMs when data is stored in a distributed manner.

Meanwhile, for the integrity of the paper, we introduce a new model, the sparse group lasso support vector machine (SGL-SVM), and apply it to music information retrieval.

Traditional approaches tackle such a problem by performing tensor singular value decomposition, which is computationally expensive and becomes infeasible for large-scale tensors. Recent approaches address this issue by factorizing the tensor into two smaller factor tensors and solving the resulting problem using gradient descent. However, this kind of approach requires an accurate estimate of the tensor rank, and when the rank is overestimated, the convergence of gradient descent and its variants slows down significantly or even diverges. To address this problem, we propose an Alternating Preconditioned Gradient Descent (APGD) algorithm, which accelerates convergence in the over-parameterized setting by adding a preconditioning term to the original gradient and updating these two factors alternately. Based on certain geometric assumptions on the objective function, we establish linear convergence guarantees for more general low-tubal-rank tensor estimation problems. Then we further analyze the specific cases of low-tubal-rank tensor factorization and low-tubal-rank tensor recovery. Our theoretical results show that APGD achieves linear convergence even under over-parameterization, and the convergence rate is independent of the tensor condition number. Extensive simulations on synthetic data are carried out to validate our theoretical assertions."}

It has recently been shown that predefined vector systems, specifically An root system vectors, can be used as targets for latent space configurations (LSC) to ensure the desired LS structure. One of the main LSC advantage is the possibility of training classifier NNs without classification layers, which facilitates training NNs on datasets with extremely large numbers of classes. This paper provides a more general overview of possible vector systems for NN training along with their properties and methods for vector system construction. These systems are used to configure LS of encoders and visual transformers to significantly speed up ImageNet-1K and 50k-600k classes LSC training. It is also shown that using the minimum number of LS dimensions for a specific number of classes results in faster convergence. The latter has potential advantages for reducing the size of vector databases used to store NN embeddings."}

It covers an introduction to machine learning and describes various theoretical advances and practical projects in the field. The Lecture here is presented in its original format, but a few remarks have been added in 2025 to reflect recent developments, and the list of references has been updated to enhance the convenience and accuracy for readers.\n  When did machine learning start? Maybe a good starting point is 1949, when Claude Shannon proposed a learning algorithm for chess-playing programs. Or maybe we should go back to the 1930s when Ronald Fisher developed discriminant analysis - a type of learning where the problem is to construct a decision rule that separates two types of vectors. Or could it be the 18th century when David Hume discussed the idea of induction? Or the 14th century, when William of Ockham formulated the principle of \"simplicity\" known as \"Ockham's razor\" (Ockham, by the way, is a small village not far from Royal Holloway). Or it may be that, like almost everything else in Western civilisation and culture, the origin of these ideas lies in the Mediterranean. After all, it was Aristotle who said that \"we learn some things only by doing things\".\n  The field of machine learning has been greatly influenced by other disciplines and the subject is in itself not a very homogeneous discipline, but includes separate, overlapping subfields. There are many parallel lines of research in ML: inductive learning, neural networks, clustering, and theories of learning. They are all part of the more general field of machine learning."}

In such settings, conventional model-learning methods are fundamentally inconsistent, as the transition and reward mechanisms generated under a behavioral policy do not correspond to the interventional quantities required for evaluating a state-based policy. To address this issue, we adapt a proximal off-policy evaluation approach that identifies the confounded reward expectation using only observable state-action-reward trajectories under mild invertibility conditions on proxy variables. When combined with a behavior-averaged transition model, this construction yields a surrogate MDP whose Bellman operator is well defined and consistent for state-based policies, and which integrates seamlessly with the maximum causal entropy (MaxCausalEnt) model-learning framework. The proposed formulation enables principled model learning and planning in confounded environments where contextual information is unobserved, unavailable, or impractical to collect."}

While manipulating token-level entropy has proven effective for promoting policy exploration, we argue that the latent dynamics underlying token generation encode a far richer computational structure for steering policy optimization toward a more effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To enable tractable analysis and intervention of the latent dynamics of LRMs, we leverage Koopman operator theory to obtain a linearized representation of their hidden-state dynamics. This enables us to introduce Dynamic Spectral Dispersion (DSD), a new metric to quantify the heterogeneity of the model's latent dynamics, serving as a direct indicator of policy exploration. Building upon these foundations, we propose Reasoning with Latent eXploration (ReLaX), a paradigm that explicitly incorporates latent dynamics to regulate exploration and exploitation during policy optimization. Comprehensive experiments across a wide range of multimodal and text-only reasoning benchmarks show that ReLaX significantly mitigates premature convergence and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

We investigate Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), large pre-trained models for generic time series, as an alternative for PMF. Using DF time series derived from real-life event logs, we compare zero-shot use of TSFMs, without additional training, with fine-tuned variants adapted on PMF-specific data. TSFMs generally achieve lower forecasting errors (MAE and RMSE) than traditional and specialized models trained from scratch on the same logs, indicating effective transfer of temporal structure from non-process domains. While fine-tuning can further improve accuracy, the gains are often small and may disappear on smaller or more complex datasets, so zero-shot use remains a strong default. Our study highlights the generalization capability and data efficiency of TSFMs for process-related time series and, to the best of our knowledge, provides the first systematic evaluation of temporal foundation models for PMF."}

On the MASK benchmark, which separates honesty from knowledge, we evaluate seven models spanning the LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral families and find that Gaussian scheduling improves honesty over no-steering and single-layer baselines in six of seven models. Equal-budget ablations on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct show the Gaussian schedule outperforms random, uniform, and box-filter depth allocations, indicating that how intervention is distributed across depth materially affects outcomes beyond total strength.

We use empirical results and theoretical analysis to substantiate this claim. In idealized experiments on empirical risk minimization, we show that SGD is drawn to parameter choices that are robust under resampling and thus avoids spurious solutions even if they lie in wider and deeper minima of the training loss. We prove rigorously that by implicitly regularizing the trace of the gradient covariance matrix, SGD controls the algorithmic variability. This regularization leads to solutions that are less sensitive to sampling noise, thereby improving generalization. Numerical experiments on neural network training show that explicitly incorporating the estimate of the algorithmic variability as a regularizer improves test performance. This fact supports our claim that bootstrap estimation underpins SGD's generalization advantages."}

Here, we argue that several important barriers to adoption can be addressed using Bayesian network modelling. To demonstrate this, we evaluate a model for depression and anxiety symptom prediction from voice and speech features in large-scale datasets (30,135 unique speakers). Alongside performance for conditions and symptoms (for depression, anxiety ROC-AUC=0.842,0.831 ECE=0.018,0.015; core individual symptom ROC-AUC>0.74), we assess demographic fairness and investigate integration across and redundancy between different input modality types. Clinical usefulness metrics and acceptability to mental health service users are explored. When provided with sufficiently rich and large-scale multimodal data streams and specified to represent common mental conditions at the symptom rather than disorder level, such models are a principled approach for building robust assessment support tools: providing clinically-relevant outputs in a transparent and explainable format that is directly amenable to expert clinical supervision."}

Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in adoption and usage across user segments. Earlier adopters, users in countries with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment, and individuals working in digital or knowledge-intensive sectors -- such as digital technology, academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship -- are more likely to adopt or actively use the agent. To systematically characterize the substance of agent usage, we introduce a hierarchical agentic taxonomy that organizes use cases across three levels: topic, subtopic, and task.

The key finding is not that fictional money makes models smarter; accuracy gains were modest and did not reach statistical significance (p = .089) in this pilot. Rather, the betting mechanic created a legible confidence signal absent from binary yes/no outputs. This suggests that simple financial framing may help transform LLMs into risk-aware forecasters, making their internal beliefs visible and usable. The protocol offers a foundation for future work for meta-evaluation systems and what may become LLM-to-LLM prediction markets."}

Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in automating ASD diagnosis, but most existing models operate as black boxes and are typically trained on a single dataset, limiting their generalizability. In this study, we introduce a transparent and interpretable ML approach that leverages BioBERT, a state-of-the-art language model, to analyze unstructured clinical text. The model is trained to label descriptions of behaviors and map them to diagnostic criteria, which are then used to assign a final label (ASD or not). We evaluate transfer learning, the ability to transfer knowledge to new data, using two distinct real-world datasets. We trained on datasets sequentially and mixed together and compared the performance of the best models and their ability to transfer to new data. We also created a black-box approach and repeated this transfer process for comparison. Our transparent model demonstrated robust performance, with the mixed-data training strategy yielding the best results (97 % sensitivity, 98 % specificity). Sequential training across datasets led to a slight drop in performance, highlighting the importance of training data order. The black-box model performed worse (90 % sensitivity, 96 % specificity) when trained sequentially or with mixed data. Overall, our transparent approach outperformed the black-box approach. Mixing datasets during training resulted in slightly better performance and should be the preferred approach when practically possible. This work paves the way for more trustworthy, generalizable, and clinically actionable AI tools in neurodevelopmental diagnostics."}

We recast grounding from a binary judgment into an audit across desiderata, each indexed by an evaluation tuple (context, meaning type, threat model, reference distribution): authenticity (mechanisms reside inside the agent and, for strong claims, were acquired through learning or evolution); preservation (atomic meanings remain intact); faithfulness, both correlational (realized meanings match intended ones) and etiological (internal mechanisms causally contribute to success); robustness (graceful degradation under declared perturbations); compositionality (the whole is built systematically from the parts). We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition. By operationalizing a philosophical inquiry about representation, we equip philosophers of science, computer scientists, linguists, and mathematicians with a common language and technical framework for systematic investigation of grounding and meaning."}

We introduce a controlled evaluation framework that probes reasoning reliability through four targeted stress tests: (1) rule deletion, removing either redundant or essential rules from a multi-step inference chain; (2) contradictory evidence injection; (3) logic-preserving rewrites generated through several families of equivalence laws (contrapositive, double negation, implication, De Morgan, identity, and commutativity); and (4) multi-law equivalence stacking that introduces 2-5 simultaneous logical transformations.\n  Across three representative model families: BERT, Qwen2, and LLaMA-like models. Our experiments reveal a strikingly consistent pattern: all models achieve perfect accuracy on the base tasks and remain fully generalise to redundant rule deletion and all equivalence-based rewrites (single or multi-law), but fail sharply under essential rule deletion (dropping to 25% accuracy) and collapse completely in the presence of explicit contradictions (0% accuracy). These results demonstrate that LLMs possess stable invariance to semantic-preserving logical transformations, yet remain fundamentally brittle to missing or conflicting evidence. Our framework provides a clean diagnostic tool for isolating such reasoning failure modes and highlights persistent gaps in the logical generalisation abilities of current LLMs."}

To address this issue and measure the confidence of model outputs, multiple uncertainty quantification(UQ) criteria have been proposed. However, even though important, there are limited tools to integrate these methods, hindering the practical usage of UQ methods and future research in this domain. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce UncertaintyZoo, a unified toolkit that integrates 29 uncertainty quantification methods, covering five major categories under a standardized interface. Using UncertaintyZoo, we evaluate the usefulness of existing uncertainty quantification methods under the code vulnerability detection task on CodeBERT and ChatGLM3 models.

In this work, we investigate the effective memory span of transformer-based world models through an analysis of several memory augmentation mechanisms. We introduce a taxonomy that distinguishes between memory encoding and memory injection mechanisms, motivating their roles in extending the world model's memory through the lens of residual stream dynamics. Using a state recall evaluation task, we measure the memory recall of each mechanism and analyze its respective trade-offs.

We prove the taxonomy's visual coherence by training a CNN on raw grid pixels (95.24% accuracy on S3, 36.25% overall, 3.3x chance), then apply the taxonomy diagnostically to the original ARC-AGI-2 test set. Our curriculum analysis reveals 35.3% of tasks exhibit low neural affinity for Transformers--a distributional bias mirroring ARC-AGI-2. To probe this misalignment, we fine-tuned a 1.7M-parameter Transformer across 302 tasks, revealing a profound Compositional Gap: 210 of 302 tasks (69.5%) achieve >80% cell accuracy (local patterns) but <10% grid accuracy (global synthesis). This provides direct evidence for a Neural Affinity Ceiling Effect, where performance is bounded by architectural suitability, not curriculum. Applying our framework to Li et al.'s independent ViTARC study (400 specialists, 1M examples each) confirms its predictive power: Very Low affinity tasks achieve 51.9% versus 77.7% for High affinity (p<0.001), with a task at 0% despite massive data. The taxonomy enables precise diagnosis: low-affinity tasks (A2) hit hard ceilings, while high-affinity tasks (C1) reach 99.8%.

Among various XAI approaches, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has gained prominence due to its ability to provide both global and local explanations across different machine learning models. While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds. To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations. This integration is guided by user-defined parameters (such as feature aliases, descriptions, and additional background) to tailor the explanation to both the model context and the user perspective. We hypothesize that this enhancement can improve the perceived understandability of SHAP explanations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed package, we applied it in a healthcare-related case study and conducted user evaluations involving real end-users. The results, based on Likert-scale surveys and follow-up interviews, indicate that the generated explanations were perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate compared to visual-only outputs. While the findings are preliminary, they suggest that combining visualization with contextualized text may support more user-friendly and trustworthy model explanations."}

However, existing approaches typically treat observations as high-level conditioning inputs to the denoising network, rather than integrating them into the stochastic dynamics of the diffusion process itself. As a result, sampling must begin from random Gaussian noise, weakening the coupling between perception and control and often yielding suboptimal performance. We introduce BridgePolicy, a generative visuomotor policy that explicitly embeds observations within the stochastic differential equation via a diffusion-bridge formulation. By constructing an observation-informed trajectory, BridgePolicy enables sampling to start from a rich, informative prior rather than random noise, substantially improving precision and reliability in control. A key challenge is that classical diffusion bridges connect distributions with matched dimensionality, whereas robotic observations are heterogeneous and multi-modal and do not naturally align with the action space. To address this, we design a multi-modal fusion module and a semantic aligner that unify visual and state inputs and align observation and action representations, making the bridge applicable to heterogeneous robot data. Extensive experiments across 52 simulation tasks on three benchmarks and five real-world tasks demonstrate that BridgePolicy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative policies."}

We show that both paradigms instantiate the same geometric structure: each learns a set of linear directions in activation space whose nonnegative combinations form a concept cone. Supervised and unsupervised methods thus differ not in kind but in how they select this cone. Building on this view, we propose an operational bridge between the two paradigms. CBMs provide human-defined reference geometries, while SAEs can be evaluated by how well their learned cones approximate or contain those of CBMs. This containment framework yields quantitative metrics linking inductive biases -- such as SAE type, sparsity, or expansion ratio -- to emergence of plausible\\footnote{We adopt the terminology of \\citet{jacovi2020towards}, who distinguish between faithful explanations (accurately reflecting model computations) and plausible explanations (aligning with human intuition and domain knowledge).

Using these metrics, we uncover a ``sweet spot'' in both sparsity and expansion factor that maximizes both geometric and semantic alignment with CBM concepts.

We introduce ReasonBENCH, the first benchmark designed to quantify the underlying instability in LLM reasoning. ReasonBENCH provides (i) a modular evaluation library that standardizes reasoning frameworks, models, and tasks, (ii) a multi-run protocol that reports statistically reliable metrics for both quality and cost, and (iii) a public leaderboard to encourage variance-aware reporting.
