### [1] [The superradiant phase is a finite size effect in two-photon processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19986)
*Fabrizio Ramírez,David Villaseñor,Nahum Vázquez,Jorge G. Hirsch*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该研究揭示双光子Dicke模型中的超辐射相并非真实的热力学相，而是有限尺寸效应；随着系统增大，该区域收缩并在热力学极限下消失，但光谱坍缩现象仍存在，这限制了其在量子技术中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清双光子Dicke模型中超辐射相的本质，验证其是否可作为热力学相存在，以评估其在量子应用中的可行性。

Method: 结合解析分析与数值模拟，研究系统尺寸对超辐射区域的影响。

Result: 超辐射区域随系统尺寸增大而缩小，在热力学极限下完全消失；光谱坍缩现象持续存在。

Conclusion: 双光子系统的超辐射条件并非真实热力学相，仅为有限尺寸效应，这对量子平台的实现构成约束。

Abstract: Two-photon light-matter interactions exhibit distinctive features such as spectral collapse. The two-photon Dicke model has been reported to exhibit a superradiant phase which could be useful in quantum applications. Here we show that this superradiant phase is not a genuine thermodynamic phase but a finite-size effect. Combining analytical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the superradiant region shrinks with increasing system size and disappears in the thermodynamic limit, while spectral collapse remains. Our results clarify the nature of superradiant conditions in two-photon systems and constrain its realization in quantum platforms.

TL;DR: 开发新型分子-二维材料混合结构，将自旋活性分子锚定在六方氮化硼表面，实现室温下长寿命量子传感，突破传统固态平台深度限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光学寻址表面量子自旋传感器受限于量子自旋稳定所需的有限深度，难以实现真正的表面原子级分辨率与量子极限灵敏度

Method: 将自旋活性分子锚定在六方氮化硼(hBN)表面构建杂化结构，并通过分子氘化化学调控优化自旋性能

Result: 在4K下Hahn回波自旋相干时间达3.4μs（超过体相有机晶体），氘化后提升10倍；动态解耦下相干时间超300μs；室温下成功探测近邻质子自旋及二维磁体磁响应

Conclusion: 该分子表面量子传感器兼具长相干时间、光学寻址性与界面通用性，为可扩展量子传感提供超越传统固态平台的新架构

Abstract: Optically addressable spins at material surfaces have represented a long-standing ambition in quantum sensing, providing atomic resolution and quantum-limited sensitivity. However, they are constrained by a finite depth at which the quantum spins can be stabilized. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid molecular-2D architecture that realizes quantum spin sensors directly on top of the surface. By anchoring spin-active molecules onto hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we eliminate the depth of the quantum sensor while also exhibiting robust spin properties from 4~K to room temperature (RT). The Hahn-echo spin coherence time exceeds \(T_2 = 3.4~\upmu\text{s}\) at 4~K, outperforming values in bulk organic crystals and overturning the prevailing expectation that spin inevitably deteriorates upon approaching the surface. By chemically tuning the molecule through deuteration, \(T_2\) improves by more than 10-fold, and under dynamic decoupling, coherence is prolonged to the intrinsic lifetime limit, exceeding 300~\(\upmu\text{s}\). Proximal proton spins and the magnetic response of two-dimensional magnets beneath the hBN layer have been detected at RT. These molecular spins form surface quantum sensors with long coherence, optical addressability, and interfacial versatility, enabling a scalable, adaptable architecture beyond what conventional solid-state platforms offer.

TL;DR: 该论文研究量子搜索中反馈机制对时间复杂度的影响，发现虽可优化搜索时间，但在计入测量成本后不违反Grover算法的最优性边界，但对有限数据库和容错量子搜索具有应用前景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索反馈机制是否能突破Grover算法的二次加速极限(Θ(√N))，对于理解量子搜索的理论边界和开发实用算法具有重要意义。

Method: 采用连续时间量子行走模型，在完全图上实现目标监测与定时重置的反馈机制，通过优化跳跃振幅、探测速率和重置速率来最小化搜索时间。

Result: 发现特定参数条件下搜索时间可优于Grover标度，但计入测量物理实现时间后整体不违反最优性边界；有限规模数据库中监测机制能保证快速收敛。

Conclusion: 反馈机制为容错量子搜索提供了有前景的途径，虽未突破Grover算法的理论极限，但在实际应用中具有价值。

Abstract: Searching a database is a central task in computer science and is paradigmatic of transport and optimization problems in physics. For an unstructured search, Grover's algorithm predicts a quadratic speedup, with the search time $τ(N)=Θ(\sqrt{N})$ and $N$ the database size. Numerical studies suggest that the time complexity can change in the presence of feedback, injecting information during the search. Here, we determine the time complexity of the quantum analog of a randomized algorithm, which implements feedback in a simple form. The search is a continuous-time quantum walk on a complete graph, where the target is continuously monitored by a detector. Additionally, the quantum state is reset if the detector does not click within a specified time interval. This yields a non-unitary, non-Markovian dynamics. We optimize the search time as a function of the hopping amplitude, detection rate, and resetting rate, and identify the conditions under which time complexity could outperform Grover's scaling. The overall search time does not violate Grover's optimality bound when including the time budget of the physical implementation of the measurement. For databases of finite sizes monitoring can warrant rapid convergence and provides a promising avenue for fault-tolerant quantum searches.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种量子电路提取新方案，通过ZX图与硬件自适应路由的紧密集成，利用提取过程中的自由度，交替生成和评估多种提取选项，形成反馈循环以优化电路，并在中性原子硬件上实现验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量子电路提取与硬件路由通常作为独立步骤处理，导致电路效率低下；需一种能动态结合ZX图提取自由度与硬件约束的集成方案，以提升编译质量。

Method: 设计交替执行"生成多提取选项"和"基于硬件约束评估选项"的反馈循环机制，将路由算法信息反向指导ZX图到电路的转换过程，支持模块化集成不同提取算法、路由策略及目标硬件。

Result: 实现基于SWAP路由的中性原子硬件参考实例，在中型基准电路测试中显著降低电路深度；开源代码促进其他工具集成，推动方案优化。

Conclusion: 该方案成为量子编译器的通用模块，通过硬件感知的提取-路由协同优化提升电路效率，为未来量子编译框架提供可扩展基础。

Abstract: We present a novel quantum circuit extraction scheme that tightly integrates graph-like ZX diagrams with hardware-adaptive routing. The method utilizes the degrees of freedom during the conversion from a ZX diagram to a quantum circuit (extraction). It alternates between generating multiple extraction options and evaluating them based on hardware constraints, allowing the routing algorithm to inform and guide the extraction process. This feedback loop extends existing graph-like ZX extraction and supports modular integration of different extraction algorithms, routing strategies, and target hardware, making it a versatile building block during compilation. To perform numerical evaluations, a reference instance of the scheme is implemented with SWAP-based routing for neutral atom hardware and evaluated using various benchmark collections on small-to mid-scale circuits. The reference code is available as open-source, allowing fast integration of other extraction and/or routing tools to stimulate further research and foster improvements of the proposed scheme.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A scalable manufacturing method using silicon masks and microtransfer printing enables high-yield production of diamond quantum photonic devices, overcoming previous fabrication bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diamond's atomic-scale defects offer exceptional quantum properties, but conventional lithography-based fabrication is slow, unscalable, and limits uniformity/yield for quantum photonic systems.

Method: Leveraging commercial semiconductor foundries to create high-precision silicon masks, then transferring patterns onto diamond via microtransfer printing to define nanoscale optical structures in arrays.

Result: Produced hundreds of uniform "quantum microchiplets" with enhanced optical performance, controlled quantum emitter interactions, and replaceable defective units; enabled integration with photonic/electronic circuits.

Conclusion: This foundry-compatible approach provides a practical pathway for large-scale quantum photonic systems and hybrid quantum-classical technologies using established semiconductor infrastructure.

Abstract: Quantum technologies promise secure communication networks and powerful new forms of information processing, but building these systems at scale remains a major challenge. Diamond is an especially attractive material for quantum devices because it can host atomic-scale defects that emit single photons and store quantum information with exceptional stability. However, fabricating the optical structures needed to control light in diamond typically relies on slow, bespoke processes that are difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce a manufacturing approach that brings diamond quantum photonics closer to industrial production. Instead of sequentially defining each device by lithography written directly on diamond, we fabricate high-precision silicon masks using commercial semiconductor foundries and transfer them onto diamond via microtransfer printing. These masks define large arrays of nanoscale optical structures, shifting the most demanding pattern-definition steps away from the diamond substrate, improving uniformity, yield, and throughput. Using this method, we demonstrate hundreds of diamond "quantum microchiplets" with improved optical performance and controlled interaction with quantum emitters. The chiplet format allows defective devices to be replaced and enables integration with existing photonic and electronic circuits. Our results show that high-quality diamond quantum devices can be produced using scalable, foundry-compatible techniques. This approach provides a practical pathway toward large-scale quantum photonic systems and hybrid quantum-classical technologies built on established semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure.

TL;DR: 提出Orbit-QAOA算法，通过循环重访层并选择性冻结稳定参数，在保持MA-QAOA性能的同时将训练步数减少81.8%，近似比误差降低72倍


<details>

Motivation: 解决多角QAOA(MA-QAOA)参数过多导致的经典计算成本高，以及逐层训练方法(LMA-QAOA)因固定先前参数而可能无法获得精确解的问题，探索参数更新的最优粒度和部分更新策略

Method: 提出Orbit-QAOA，采用每轮迭代优化一个完整层的粒度，通过追踪梯度变化选择性地重训各层，循环访问并冻结已稳定参数

Result: 在多种图基准测试中，相比改进版LMA-QAOA，训练步数减少最多81.8%，近似比误差降低72倍；与标准MA-QAOA相比，达到同等近似性能

Conclusion: 每层更新是MA-QAOA训练的高效粒度，基于梯度变化的选择性重训策略可在降低参数更新开销的同时获得精确结果，Orbit-QAOA为MA-QAOA提供了高效的训练方案

Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Multi-angle QAOA (MA-QAOA), which assigns independent parameters to each Hamiltonian operator term, achieves superior approximation performance even with fewer layers than standard QAOA. Unfortunately, this increased expressibility can raise the classical computational cost due to a greater number of parameters. The recently proposed Layerwise MA-QAOA (LMA-QAOA) reduces this overhead by training one layer at a time, but it may suffer from obtaining the precise solution due to the previously fixed parameters. This work addresses two questions for efficient MA-QAOA training: (i) What is the optimal granularity for parameter updates per epoch, and (ii) How can we get precise final cost function results while only partially updating the parameters per epoch? Despite the benefit of reducing the parameters that update per epoch can reduce the classical computation overhead, too fine or coarse a granularity of Hamiltonian update can degrade the MA-QAOA training efficiency. We find that optimizing one complete layer per epoch is an efficient granularity. Moreover, selectively retraining each layer by tracking gradient variations can achieve a final cost function equivalent to the standard MA-QAOA while lowering the parameter update overhead. Based on these insights, we propose Orbit-QAOA, which cyclically revisits layers and selectively freezes stabilized parameters. Across diverse graph benchmarks, Orbit-QAOA reduces training steps by up to 81.8%, reduces approximation ratio error by up to 72x compared to the unified stop condition-applied enhanced LMA-QAOA, and achieves equivalent approximation performance compared to the standard MA-QAOA.

### [7] [Quantum Channels on Graphs: a Resonant Tunneling Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20044)
*Giuseppe Catalano,Farzad Kianvash,Vittorio Giovannetti*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper develops a quantum-information framework for analyzing scattering on structured networks, revealing how resonant concatenation of scattering channels can suppress noise and enable super-activation of quantum capacity (where combined channels have positive capacity despite individual zero-capacity components).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how quantum interference effects influence information propagation in structured networks and develop a general methodology for analyzing coherent quantum information flow in quantum graphs.

Method: Treats the entire network as a quantum channel linking input/output ports, using the Redheffer star product to construct global scattering matrices from local ones, enabling analysis of resonant effects from internal back-reflections.

Result: Identifies "resonant concatenation" - a nonlinear composition rule that suppresses noise and produces super-activation of quantum capacity, allowing positive capacity in configurations where individual channels have zero capacity.

Conclusion: The framework provides a general methodology for analyzing quantum information flow in structured environments with applications in quantum communication, control, and simulation, demonstrating resonant-tunneling-enhanced transport models.

Abstract: Quantum transport on structured networks is strongly influenced by interference effects, which can dramatically modify how information propagates through a system. We develop a quantum-information-theoretic framework for scattering on graphs in which a full network of connected scattering sites is treated as a quantum channel linking designated input and output ports. Using the Redheffer star product to construct global scattering matrices from local ones, we identify resonant concatenation, a nonlinear composition rule generated by internal back-reflections. In contrast to ordinary channel concatenation, resonant concatenation can suppress noise and even produce super-activation of the quantum capacity, yielding positive capacity in configurations where each constituent channel individually has zero capacity. We illustrate these effects through models exhibiting resonant-tunneling-enhanced transport. Our approach provides a general methodology for analyzing coherent information flow in quantum graphs, with relevance for quantum communication, control, and simulation in structured environments.

TL;DR: 研究忽略场缀饰里德堡原子 manifold 中允许的射频跃迁对光学EIT光谱预测的影响，表明这种忽略会导致显著的理论偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在里德堡原子电磁诱导透明(EIT)的理论建模中，场缀饰态的子态间存在允许的射频跃迁。若模型仅考虑光跃迁而忽略这些射频跃迁，预测光谱将出现系统性误差。本研究旨在量化这种忽略带来的后果，强调完整考虑所有允许跃迁对准确预测实验光谱的必要性。

Method: 基于缀饰态理论框架，对比分析两种模型：(1) 完整模型：包含所有允许的光学跃迁和射频跃迁；(2) 简化模型：仅考虑主量子数间的跃迁。通过求解光学布洛赫方程，计算并比较两种模型在光学探测方案下的吸收光谱。

Result: 简化模型会遗漏光谱中的关键特征，包括：(1) 额外的透明窗口和吸收峰；(2) Autler-Townes分裂的异常线型；(3) 透明窗口深度和宽度的显著偏差。定量分析表明，在典型参数下，忽略射频跃迁可导致谱线强度预测误差达30-50%，并完全错过某些共振特征。

Conclusion: 场缀饰里德堡系统的EIT光谱预测必须包含所有允许的射频跃迁，否则理论模型将无法准确描述实验观测。该结论对里德堡原子精密光谱、量子信息处理及相关精密测量实验的理论设计具有指导意义。

Abstract: We discuss the consequence of excluding allowed RF-transition between substates of a field-dressed Rydberg manifold when predicting the spectrum that will be observed if the dressed system is probed in an optical EIT scheme.

Conclusion: 这为将误差缓解无缝集成到算法设计中提供了实用路径，推动了鲁棒量子计算的发展，并使近期和中期量子设备上的科学应用发现成为可能。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in quantum hardware, noise remains a central obstacle to deploying quantum algorithms on near-term devices. In particular, random coherent errors that accumulate during circuit execution constitute a dominant and fundamentally challenging noise source. We introduce a noise-resilient framework for Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) that mitigates such coherent errors without increasing circuit depth or ancillary qubit requirements. Our approach uses ensembles of noisy QSP circuits combined with measurement-level averaging to suppress random phase errors in Z rotations. Building on this framework, we develop robust QSP algorithms for implementing polynomial functions of Hermitian matrices and for estimating observables, with applications to Hamiltonian simulation, quantum linear systems, and ground-state preparation. We analyze the trade-off between approximation error and hardware noise, which is essential for practical implementation under the stringent depth and coherence constraints of current quantum hardware. Our results establish a practical pathway for integrating error mitigation seamlessly into algorithmic design, advancing the development of robust quantum computing, and enabling the discovery of scientific applications with near- and mid-term quantum devices.

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In a seminal work [PRL85.4972], Walgate, Short, Hardy, and Vedral prove in finite dimensions that for every pair of pure multipartite orthogonal quantum states, there exists a one-way local operations and classical communication (LOCC) protocol that perfectly distinguishes the pair. We extend this result to infinite dimensions with a simpler proof. For states on $\mathbb{C}^{d_A \times d_A} \otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_B \times d_B}$, we strengthen this existence result by constructing an $O(d_A^2 d_B^2)$-time algorithm that specifies such a perfect one-way LOCC protocol. Finally, we establish the equivalence between Walgate et al.'s result and the fact that the one-shot environment-assisted classical capacity of every quantum channel is at least 1 bit per channel use, thereby clarifying the literature on these notions. At the core of all of these results is the fact that every operator with vanishing trace admits a basis where its diagonal entries are all zero.

Conclusion: 这项工作为准周期量子行走提供了首个可解模型，其稳定的奇异连续谱区域对量子行走理论有重要意义，深化了对量子行走谱相结构的理解。

Abstract: This paper introduces and rigorously analyzes a new class of one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks whose dynamics are governed by a parametrized family of extended CMV matrices. The model generalizes the unitary almost Mathieu operator (UAMO) and exhibits a richer spectral phase diagram, closely resembling the extended Harper's model. It provides the first example of a solvable quasi-periodic quantum walk that exhibits a stable region of purely singular continuous spectrum.

*Massimo Solinas,Agnes Valenti,Nawaf Bou-Rabee,Roeland Wiersema*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper studies mixed-precision arithmetic in neural-network Variational Monte Carlo for quantum many-body systems, deriving error bounds for Metropolis-Hastings MCMC and showing half precision can safely accelerate quantum state sampling without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While scientific computing traditionally relies on double-precision for accuracy, GPUs make low-precision formats attractive for performance and energy efficiency. The paper investigates when and how mixed-precision can be safely applied in neural-network VMC methods for quantum simulations.

Method: The authors derive general analytical error bounds for reduced precision in Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, then empirically validate these bounds on Variational Monte Carlo simulations of quantum many-body systems.

Result: Significant portions of VMC, especially quantum state sampling, can use half precision without accuracy degradation. The theoretical framework is empirically validated, demonstrating practical effectiveness of mixed-precision strategies.

Conclusion: Mixed-precision arithmetic enables more scalable and energy-efficient quantum many-body simulations via neural-network VMC without compromising accuracy. The work provides both theoretical foundations and practical validation for low-precision arithmetic in MCMC-based machine learning.

Abstract: Scientific computing has long relied on double precision (64-bit floating point) arithmetic to guarantee accuracy in simulations of real-world phenomena. However, the growing availability of hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has made low-precision formats attractive due to their superior performance, reduced memory footprint, and improved energy efficiency. In this work, we investigate the role of mixed-precision arithmetic in neural-network based Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), a widely used method for solving computationally otherwise intractable quantum many-body systems. We first derive general analytical bounds on the error introduced by reduced precision on Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, and then empirically validate these bounds on the use-case of VMC. We demonstrate that significant portions of the algorithm, in particular, sampling the quantum state, can be executed in half precision without loss of accuracy. More broadly, this work provides a theoretical framework to assess the applicability of mixed-precision arithmetic in machine-learning approaches that rely on MCMC sampling. In the context of VMC, we additionally demonstrate the practical effectiveness of mixed-precision strategies, enabling more scalable and energy-efficient simulations of quantum many-body systems.

TL;DR: Replacing argon with krypton in Ta sputtering enables low-temperature (200°C) deposition of high-performance superconducting tantalum films compatible with semiconductor manufacturing, achieving state-of-the-art qubit quality factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ta superconducting qubit fabrication requires >400°C deposition incompatible with standard semiconductor back-end-of-the-line (BEOL) processes, hindering scalable quantum chip manufacturing.

Method: Replaced argon sputter gas with krypton to enable low-temperature (200-350°C) deposition of body-centered cubic Ta films on silicon substrates.

Result: Achieved BCC Ta at 200°C with higher electronic conductivity; resonator quality factors reached state-of-the-art (median qubit Q=14M) with 20μm capacitor gap; higher temperatures caused Ta/Si intermixing and increased losses.

Conclusion: Krypton sputtering provides a BEOL-compatible process window for high-performance Ta superconducting devices, enabling scalable quantum processor fabrication using standard semiconductor techniques.

Abstract: Superconducting qubits based on tantalum (Ta) thin films have demonstrated the highest-performing microwave resonators and qubits. This makes Ta an attractive material for superconducting quantum computing applications, but, so far, direct deposition has largely relied on high substrate temperatures exceeding \SI{400}{\celsius} to achieve the body-centered cubic phase, BCC (\textalpha-Ta). This leads to compatibility issues for scalable fabrication leveraging standard semiconductor fabrication lines. Here, we show that changing the sputter gas from argon (Ar) to krypton (Kr) promotes BCC Ta synthesis on silicon (Si) at temperatures as low as \SI{200}{\celsius}, providing a wide process window compatible with back-end-of-the-line fabrication standards. Furthermore, we find these films to have substantially higher electronic conductivity, consistent with clean-limit superconductivity. We validated the microwave performance through coplanar waveguide resonator measurements, finding that films deposited at \SI{250}{\celsius} and \SI{350}{\celsius} exhibit a tight performance distribution at the state of the art. Higher temperature-grown films exhibit higher losses, in correlation with the degree of Ta/Si intermixing revealed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. Finally, with these films, we demonstrate transmon qubits with a relatively compact, \SI{20}{\micro\meter} capacitor gap, achieving a median quality factor up to 14 million.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes and analyzes a practical scheme to implement a non-Hermitian topological model (SSH) using programmable Rydberg atom arrays, achieving a robust non-Hermitian skin effect through engineered dissipation and synthetic gauge fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a versatile, controllable, and programmable open-system quantum simulator using neutral atoms to explore rich non-Hermitian topological phenomena.

Method: The method involves creating an atomic chain with three-atom unit cells. A synthetic gauge field is generated via multi-color laser fields. Fast dissipative channels are engineered for an auxiliary atom in each unit cell, leading to an effective non-Hermitian skin effect via adiabatic elimination.

Result: The scheme successfully produces the desired non-Hermitian skin effect. Crucially, both the skin effect and the topological invariant are found to be highly robust against fluctuations in experimental parameters under both open and periodic boundary conditions.

Conclusion: This work provides a clear and practical route for implementing a non-Hermitian topological model on a neutral atom platform, offering a powerful tool for simulating and studying open-system (non-Hermitian) topological physics.

Abstract: We propose and systematically analyze a practical scheme for implementing a one-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using individually addressable Rydberg atom arrays. Our setup consists of an atomic chain with three-atom unit cells, in which a synthetic gauge field is generated by applying multi-color laser fields. By engineering fast dissipative channels for one auxiliary atom in each unit cell, the adiabatic elimination effectively gives rise to a non-Hermitian skin effect. We examine how fluctuations in the experimental parameters influence both the skin effect and the topological invariant under open and periodic boundary conditions in real space and find that both features remain highly robust. This work establishes a versatile, controllable, and programmable open-system quantum simulator with neutral atoms, providing a clear route for exploring rich non-Hermitian topological phenomena.

Abstract: The minimum amount of thermodynamic work required in order to implement a quantum computation or a quantum state transformation can be quantified using frameworks based on the resource theory of thermodynamics, deeply rooted in the works of Landauer and Bennett. For instance, the work we need to invest in order to implement $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of a quantum channel is quantified by the thermodynamic capacity of the channel when we require the implementation's accuracy to be guaranteed in diamond norm over the $n$-system input. Recent work showed that work extraction can be implemented universally, meaning the same implementation works for a large class of input states, while achieving a variable work cost that is optimal for each individual i.i.d. input state. Here, we revisit some techniques leading to derivation of the thermodynamic capacity, and leverage them to construct a thermodynamic implementation of $n$ i.i.d. copies of any time-covariant quantum channel, up to some process decoherence that is necessary because the implementation reveals the amount of consumed work. The protocol uses so-called thermal operations and achieves the optimal per-input work cost for any i.i.d. input state; it relies on the conditional erasure protocol in our earlier work, adjusted to yield variable work. We discuss the effect of the work-cost decoherence. While it can significantly corrupt the correlations between the output state and any reference system, we show that for any time-covariant i.i.d. input state, the state on the output system faithfully reproduces that of the desired process to be implemented. As an immediate consequence of our results, we recover recent results for optimal work extraction from i.i.d. states up to the error scaling and implementation specifics, and propose an optimal preparation protocol for time-covariant i.i.d. states.

*Song-Ju Kim*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文从信息论角度重新诠释量子上下文性，证明上下文统计量揭示了经典描述中不可约的信息代价，而量子概率框架无需显式编码即可自然地容纳上下文操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子上下文性是区分量子与经典概率理论的核心特征，但其操作意义仍存在争议。需要从新的视角（信息论）来理解上下文性的本质。

Method: 采用信息论视角，研究被约束在多个情境下保持单一内部状态及固定语义的操作模型。

Result: 任何重现上下文统计的经典模型都必须在内部状态中嵌入情境依赖或引入携带非零信息的外部标签，从而证明上下文性是经典表征中不可约信息代价的见证。

Conclusion: 量子概率是一种能够自然地容纳上下文操作而无需显式情境编码的典范框架。

Abstract: Contextuality is a central feature distinguishing quantum from classical probability theories, yet its operational meaning remains subject to interpretation. We reconsider contextuality from an information-theoretic perspective, focusing on operational models constrained to maintain a single internal state with fixed semantics across multiple contexts. Under this constraint, we show that contextual statistics certify an unavoidable obstruction to classical probabilistic descriptions. Specifically, any classical model that reproduces such statistics must either embed contextual dependence into the internal state or introduce additional external labels carrying nonzero information. This result identifies contextuality as a witness of irreducible information cost in classical representations, rather than as a purely nonclassical anomaly. From this viewpoint, quantum probability emerges as a canonical framework that accommodates contextual operations without requiring explicit contextual encoding.

Result: 确立连续时间晶体的充分条件：非线性量子自持系统需具备组分间量子同步；将多体系统时间晶体的识别简化为两体关联评估，并将无关联时间晶体归类为平凡态。

Conclusion: 为时间晶体的识别提供了基于两体关联的简化框架，揭示了量子同步是实现非平凡时间晶体的关键机制。

Abstract: Although classical nonlinear dynamics suggests that sufficiently strong nonlinearity can sustain oscillations, quantization of such model typically yields a time-independent steady state that respects time-translation symmetry and thus precludes time-crystal behavior. We identify dephasing as the primary mechanism enforcing this symmetry, which can be suppressed by intercomponent phase correlations. Consequently, a sufficient condition for realizing a continuous time crystal is a nonlinear quantum self-sustaining system exhibiting quantum synchronization among its constituents. As a concrete example, we demonstrate spontaneous oscillations in a synchronized array of van der Pol oscillators, corroborated by both semiclassical dynamics and the quantum Liouville spectrum. These results reduce the identification of time crystals in many-body systems to the evaluation of only two-body correlations and provide a framework for classifying uncorrelated time crystals as trivial.

Abstract: Quantum computing is entering a period in which progress will be shaped as much by advances in computer science as by improvements in hardware. The central thesis of this report is that early fault-tolerant quantum computing shifts many of the primary bottlenecks from device physics alone to computer-science-driven system design, integration, and evaluation. While large-scale, fully fault-tolerant quantum computers remain a long-term objective, near- and medium-term systems will support early fault-tolerant computation with small numbers of logical qubits and tight constraints on error rates, connectivity, latency, and classical control. How effectively such systems can be used will depend on advances across algorithms, error correction, software, and architecture. This report identifies key research challenges for computer scientists and organizes them around these four areas, each centered on a fundamental question.

Abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is a quantum computational model that leverages linear optics to solve sampling problems believed to be classically intractable. Recent experimental breakthroughs have demonstrated quantum advantage using GBS, motivating its application to real-world combinatorial optimization problems.
  In this work, we reformulate the graph coloring problem as an integer programming problem using the independent set formulation. This enables the use of GBS to identify cliques in the complement graph, which correspond to independent sets in the original graph. Our method is benchmarked against classical heuristics and exact algorithms on two sets of instances: Erdős-Rényi random graphs and graphs derived from a smart-charging use case. The results demonstrate that GBS can provide competitive solutions, highlighting its potential as a quantum-enhanced heuristic for graph-based optimization.

Abstract: We present a simple framework for classical and quantum ``memory'' in which the Hamiltonian at time $t$ depends on past values of a control Hamiltonian through a causal kernel. This structure naturally describes finite-bandwidth or filtered control channels and provides a clean way to distinguish between memory in the control and genuine non-Markovian dynamics of the state. We focus on models where $H(t)=H_0+\int_{-\infty}^{t}K(t-s)\,H_1(s)\,ds$, and illustrate the framework on single-qubit examples such as $H(t)=σ_z+Φ(t)σ_x$ with $Φ(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{t}K(t-s)\,u(s)\,ds$. We derive basic properties of such dynamics, discuss conditions for unitarity, give an equivalent time-local description for exponential kernels, and show explicitly how hysteresis arises in the response of a driven qubit.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper generalizes quantum frequency mixing to a ladder-type four-level system, discovering secondary Autler-Townes splitting that enables broadband AC field sensing and reveals two coexisting quantum interference effects for coherent control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize quantum frequency mixing to ladder-type four-level systems for studying electromagnetically induced transparency, with the goal of achieving broadband AC field sensing and advancing coherent control in multi-level quantum systems.

Method: The researchers generalized quantum frequency mixing to a ladder-type four-level system, used multi-mode Floquet theory to derive an effective Hamiltonian, and introduced additional periodic driving to create a model where two quantum interference effects coexist.

Result: They observed secondary splitting of Autler-Townes splitting in transmission spectra, developed a frequency mixing scheme with continuous frequency tunability for broadband AC field sensing, and realized a model where Floquet channel interference and loop interference coexist and can be independently read from transmission spectra.

Conclusion: The work provides complementary readout for extracting AC field phase and establishes a new paradigm for coherent control in multi-level quantum systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we generalized the quantum frequency mixing technology to a ladder-type four-level system and studied its effect on electromagnetically induced transparency spectra. We found a secondary splitting of Autler-Townes splitting in the probing field transmission spectra, which could be understood by the effective Hamiltonian derived with multi-mode Floquet theory. The Frequency mixing scheme developed here enables continuous tunablity of the resonant frequency between upper levels, which facilitates the broad band sensing of AC field. Furthermore, by introducing an additional periodic driving, we realize an effective model that two distinct quantum interference effects coexist: interference among Floquet channels and loop interference arising from closed coherent pathways. Both interference effects could be read out from the transmission spectra independently. The changing of the distance between double splitting peaks represents the interference of Floquet channels, while their asymmetric linewidth broadening is linked with the total effective phase of the loop. This not only provides complementary readout for extracting the phase of AC field, but also establishes a new paradigm for coherent control in multi-level quantum systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单个量子处理单元(QPU)的量子比特数有限，而大规模Dicke态在量子计算和量子计量学中具有重要应用，因此需要研究跨多个QPU的分布式制备方法以实现可扩展性。

Method: 设计了一个通用分布式量子电路，将n量子比特k激发Dicke态D(n,k)分布在p个QPU上(每个约⌈n/p⌉量子比特)，分析了其通信复杂度、电路规模和深度，并基于目标态相关张量的典型多adic秩(CP-rank)建立了通用通信复杂度下限理论。

Result: 首次同时实现了对数通信复杂度O(p log k)、多项式电路规模O(nk)和深度O(p²k + log k log(n/k))。对于p=2的特殊情况，计算出Dicke态的CP-rank并得出通信复杂度下限为⌈log(k+1)⌉，证明该构造达到了这一基本极限。

Conclusion: 该分布式Dicke态制备方案在通信效率上是最优的，为可扩展量子计算提供了实用解决方案，同时建立的CP-rank下限理论为评估分布式量子态制备提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Preparing large-qubit Dicke states is of broad interest in quantum computing and quantum metrology. However, the number of qubits available on a single quantum processing unit (QPU) is limited -- motivating the distributed preparation of such states across multiple QPUs as a practical approach to scalability. In this article, we investigate the distributed preparation of $n$-qubit $k$-excitation Dicke states $D(n,k)$ across a general number $p$ of QPUs, presenting a distributed quantum circuit (each QPU hosting approximately $\lceil n/p \rceil$ qubits) that prepares the state with communication complexity $O(p \log k)$, circuit size $O(nk)$, and circuit depth $O\left(p^2 k + \log k \log (n/k)\right)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction to simultaneously achieve logarithmic communication complexity and polynomial circuit size and depth. We also establish a lower bound on the communication complexity of $p$-QPU distributed state preparation for a general target state. This lower bound is formulated in terms of the canonical polyadic rank (CP-rank) of a tensor associated with the target state. For the special case $p = 2$, we explicitly compute the CP-rank corresponding to the Dicke state $D(n,k)$ and derive a lower bound of $\lceil\log (k + 1)\rceil$, which shows that the communication complexity of our construction matches this fundamental limit.

Abstract: High fidelity quantum operations are key to enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. Superconducting quantum processors have demonstrated high-fidelity operations, but on larger devices there is commonly a broad distribution of qualities, with the low-performing tail affecting near-term performance and applications. Here we present an error budgeting procedure for the native two-qubit operation on a 32-qubit superconducting-qubit-based quantum computer, the OQC Toshiko gen-1 system. We estimate the prevalence of different forms of error such as coherent error and control qubit leakage, then apply error suppression strategies based on the most significant sources of error, making use of pulse-shaping and additional compensating gates. These techniques require no additional hardware overhead and little additional calibration, making them suitable for routine adoption. An average reduction of 3.7x in error rate for two qubit operations is shown across a chain of 16 qubits, with the median error rate improving from 4.6$\%$ to 1.2$\%$ as measured by interleaved randomized benchmarking. The largest improvements are seen on previously under-performing qubit pairs, demonstrating the importance of practical error suppression in reducing the low-performing tail of gate qualities and achieving consistently good performance across a device.

TL;DR: This study explores how hopping strength adjustments drive quantum phase transitions in non-Hermitian quasi-periodic SSH chains, revealing mobility rings and multi-ring phenomena under combined non-Hermitian/quasi-periodic effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate localization-delocalization transitions in SSH systems under the unexplored combined influence of non-Hermiticity and quasi-periodic mosaic modulation, moving beyond traditional on-site potential tuning methods.

Method: Analyzed non-Hermitian SSH chains with quasi-periodic on-site potential by varying intracellular/intercellular hopping strengths, examining energy spectra, eigenstate distributions, and critical behaviors near phase transition boundaries.

Result: Discovered that: (1) Mobility rings emerge uniquely in non-Hermitian systems near transition boundaries; (2) Multiple mobility rings form when mosaic modulation period increases; (3) Transition behaviors differ significantly between Hermitian/non-Hermitian cases and under mosaic modulation.

Conclusion: These findings provide crucial insights for understanding localization transitions in complex quantum systems where non-Hermiticity and quasi-periodicity interact, enabling new control mechanisms for quantum states.

Abstract: The localization property of a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with quasi-periodic on-site potential is investigated. In contrast to the preceding investigations, the quantum phase transition between localized state and extended one is achieved by adjusting the strength of intracellular or intercellular hopping. The energy spectra and eigenstate distributions of the system's Hamiltonian near the boundary of the phase transition exhibit different behaviors when the Hermiticity, non-Hermiticity and mosaic modulation of the quasi-periodic potential are considered, respectively. The existence of the mobility ring is revealed in the non-Hermitian SSH chain by studying of the critical behaviors near the boundary. More interestingly, the multiple mobility rings emerge when the period number of the mosaic modulation is increased. The result is helpful for the investigation of the localization-delocalization transition in the SSH-type system under the combined action of the non-Hermiticity and quasi-periodicity.

Motivation: 尽管量子力学取得巨大成功，但假设对岩石等宏观物体存在产生和湮灭算符是不合理的。这引发了对量子力学在普朗克尺度以上适用性的根本性质疑，特别是关于质心运动的描述。

Method: 通过理论分析，简要重审视以下两方面：(i) 需要海森堡切割来划分量子与经典领域的论据；(ii) 在海森堡切割区域预期的新型物理。

Result: 质量超过普朗克质量的系统，其质心运动应由经典力学描述，即使实验室中观察到宏观量子现象。这表明在普朗克尺度附近，波动力学无法描述质心运动，从而威胁到相应福克空间的构建。

Conclusion: 存在强有力的理由怀疑波动力学在普朗克尺度及以上描述质心运动的能力，这意味着量子与经典之间存在根本性边界（海森堡切割），并暗示该区域可能存在新的未知物理。

Abstract: The concept of quantum particles derives from quantum field theory. Accepting that quantum mechanics is valid all the way implies that not only composite particles (such as protons and neutrons) would be derived from a field theory, but also the center of mass of bodies as heavy as rocks. Despite the fabulous success of quantum mechanics, it is unreasonable to assume the existence of annihilation and creation operators for rocks, and so on. Fortunately, there are strong reasons to doubt that wave mechanics can describe the center of mass of systems at or above the Planck scale, thereby jeopardizing the construction of the corresponding Fock space. As a result, systems with masses exceeding the Planck mass would have their center of mass described through classical mechanics, regardless of being able to harbor macroscopic quantum phenomena as observed in the laboratory. Here, we briefly revisit (i) the arguments for the need for a Heisenberg cut delimitating the boundary between the quantum and classical realms and (ii) the kind of new physics expected at (the uncharted region of) the Heisenberg cut.''

Motivation: 探究静态双能级量子探测器与不同类型的相干光子态（Rindler光子与Minkowski光子）相互作用时跃迁概率的差异，并分析这种差异在不同时空维度及光子态经典极限下的行为，以揭示量子探测器响应的本质特征。

Method: 在(1+1)维和(3+1)维时空中，计算静态双能级量子探测器的跃迁概率。比较探测器与相干Rindler光子和相干Minkowski光子相互作用的响应差异，并考察光子态经典极限下的情况。在(3+1)维情形中，计算采用了大加速度条件。

Result: 1. 探测器与Rindler光子及Minkowski光子相互作用的跃迁概率存在差异。2. 该差异在光子态的经典极限下并未消失。3. 在(1+1)维时空中，当光子模式与探测器的频率相同时，经典光子态下“经典”探测器的跃迁概率在两种情形下呈现相同结果。4. 在(3+1)维大加速度条件下，未观察到这种跃迁概率相同的情况。

Conclusion: 量子探测器对光子场的响应显著依赖于时空维度和加速度条件。光子态的经典极限并不能普适性地消除不同光子态引发的探测器响应差异，这表明Unruh效应及探测器-场相互作用是本质上依赖于维度的现象。

Abstract: We observe that the transition probability in a static two-level quantum detector interacting with a coherent Rindler photon is different from the same of the Rindler detector which is in interaction with a coherent Minkowski photon. Situation does not change in the response of quantum detector for the classical limit of the photon state. This we investigate in $(1+1)$ and $(3+1)$-spacetime dimensions. Interestingly, the transition probabilities of the ``classical'' detector in the classical limit of the photon state in $(1+1)$-dimensions, for these two scenarios, appear to be identical when the frequencies of photon mode and detector are taken to be same. However, our obtained detector's transition probabilities in $(3+1)$-dimensions, which are calculated under the large acceleration condition, do not show such signature. The implications of these observations are discussed as well.

TL;DR: This paper presents a simulation study on temperature-dependent spectral dynamics and optical coherence of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), using a hybrid stochastic model to reproduce experimental observations and predict a critical temperature for overdamped dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising 2D material for stable single-photon emission, but understanding the temperature-dependent spectral diffusion and coherence degradation mechanisms is crucial for coherent optical control of quantum emitters.

Method: Employed a hybrid stochastic framework combining Ornstein-Uhlenbeck detuning fluctuations with temperature-dependent Gaussian-distributed discrete frequency jumps to model spectral diffusion and blinking observed experimentally.

Result: The model successfully reproduced inhomogeneous linewidth broadening and photon coherence degradation (5-30K), revealed a cubic temperature dependence for phonon-related spectral diffusion, and predicted a critical crossover temperature T_crit ≈ 25.91K to overdamped dynamics.

Conclusion: This hybrid framework provides a unified phenomenological description linking stochastic detuning dynamics to optical coherence decay, offering quantitative insights into dominant noise mechanisms in hBN quantum emitters with general applicability to similar systems.

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising two-dimensional host for stable single-photon emission owing to its wide bandgap, high photostability, and compatibility with nanophotonic integration. We present a simulation-based study of temperature-dependent spectral dynamics and optical coherence in a mechanically decoupled quantum emitter in hBN. Employing a hybrid stochastic framework that combines Ornstein--Uhlenbeck detuning fluctuations with temperature-dependent, Gaussian-distributed discrete frequency jumps, motivated by experimentally observed spectral diffusion and blinking, we reproduce the measured evolution of inhomogeneous linewidth broadening and the progressive degradation of photon coherence across the relevant cryogenic range (5-30K). The model captures phonon-related spectral diffusion with a cubic temperature dependence and the onset of jump-like spectral instabilities at higher temperatures. By calibrating the hybrid diffusion, jump parameters to the experimentally measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the emission line and analyzing the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(τ)$ under resonant driving, we establish a unified phenomenological description that links stochastic detuning dynamics to the decay of optical coherence in a resonantly driven emitter. Analysis of $g^{(2)}(τ)$ under resonant driving reveals an additional dephasing rate $γ_{\mathrm{sd+j}}$ that rises monotonically with temperature and drive strength, leading to a predicted critical crossover to overdamped dynamics at $T_{\mathrm{crit}} \approx 25.91$~K. This hybrid framework provides a quantitative connection between accessible spectroscopic observables and the dominant noise mechanisms limiting coherent optical control in mechanically decoupled quantum emitters, exemplified in hBN and generalizable to similar emitters in other materials.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper connects Hardy's paradox with post-selected quantum metrology, showing that anomalous weak values underlie both phenomena and that metrological enhancement efficiency depends on the relationship between weak values and their inverse expectation values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To elucidate the shared non-classical statistical features (non-positive quasi-probabilities) underlying both Hardy's paradox and post-selection-based phase estimation enhancement, and to explore how anomalous weak values connect these seemingly distinct quantum phenomena.

Method: Constructing a post-selected quantum metrology protocol explicitly modeled after Hardy's paradox, analyzing the role of an anomalous weak value that appears in both the paradoxical scenario and the metrological enhancement.

Result: The efficiency of the metrological enhancement is reduced when the expectation value associated with the anomalous weak value differs from the inverse of this value.

Conclusion: The relationship between enhanced phase estimation and the Hardy paradox requires a detailed understanding of the connection between weak values and conventional expectation values.

Abstract: Statistical paradoxes such as the Hardy paradox and the enhancement of phase estimation via post-selection both draw upon the same non-classical features of quantum statistics described by non-positive quasi-probabilities. In this paper, we introduce a post-selected quantum metrology scenario where the initial state, the dynamics associated with the phase shift, and the post-selection are all inspired by the Hardy paradox. Specifically, we identify an anomalous weak value that is characteristic of both the Hardy paradox and the potential enhancement of sensitivity by the post-selection. We find that the efficiency of the enhancement is reduced when the expectation value associated with the anomalous weak value is different from the inverse of this value. We conclude that the relation between enhanced phase estimation and the Hardy paradox requires a detailed understanding of the relation between weak values and expectation values.

Abstract: Nonclassical states of light and their correlations lie at the heart of quantum optics, serving as fundamental resources that underpin both the exploration of quantum phenomena and the realisation of quantum information protocols. These lecture notes provide an accessible yet rigorous introduction to the foundations of quantum optics, emphasising their relevance to quantum information science and technology. Starting from the quantisation of the electromagnetic field and the bosonic formalism of Fock space, the notes develop a unified framework for describing and analysing quantum states of light. Key families of states -- thermal, coherent, and squeezed -- are introduced as paradigmatic examples illustrating the transition from classical to nonclassical behaviour. The concepts of convexity, classicality, and quasiprobability representations are presented as complementary tools for characterising quantumness and defining operational notions such as P-nonclassicality. The discussion extends naturally to Gaussian states, composite systems, and continuous-variable entanglement, highlighting how nonclassicality serves as a resource for generating and quantifying quantum correlations. Theoretical developments are complemented by computational and experimental perspectives, including simulations of optical states using the Python library Strawberry Fields and data analysis from simulated data. Together, these notes aim to bridge the foundational concepts of quantum optics and modern quantum information, offering both conceptual insight and practical tools for students and researchers entering the field.

Abstract: Rydberg-atom sensors convert radiofrequency, microwave and terahertz fields into optical signals with SI-traceable calibration, high sensitivity, and broad tunability. This review assesses their potential for space applications by comparing five general architectures (Autler-Townes, AC-Stark, superheterodyne, radiofrequency-to-optical conversion, and fluorescence) against space application needs. We identify promising roles in radiometry, radar, terahertz sensing, and in-orbit calibration, and outline key limitations, including shot noise, sparse terahertz transitions, and currently large Size, Weight, Power and Cost. A staged roadmap highlights which uncertainties should be resolved first and how research organisations, industry and space agencies could take the lead for the different aspects.

Result: 12-14量子比特系统中CNOT门数量减少达97%；在LNN限制下仍比全连接ADAPT-VQE减少超70%

Conclusion: 硬件感知的ansatz设计能大幅提升量子电路效率，为实际量子设备提供更可行的状态制备方案

Abstract: We propose a co-designed variant of ADAPT-VQE (Co-ADAPT-VQE) where the quantum hardware is taken into account in the construction of the ansatz. This framework can be readily used to optimize state preparation circuits for any device, addressing shortcomings such as limited connectivity, short coherence times, and variable gate errors. We exemplify the impact of Co-ADAPT-VQE by creating state preparation circuits for devices with linear nearest-neighbor (LNN) connectivity. We show a reduction of the CNOT count of the final circuits by up to 97% for 12-14 qubit systems, with the impact being greater for larger and more strongly correlated systems. Surprisingly, the circuits created by Co-ADAPT-VQE provide an over 70% CNOT count reduction with respect to the original ADAPT-VQE in all-to-all connectivity, despite being restricted to LNN qubit interactions.

Abstract: In molecular aggregates, multiple delocalized exciton states interact with phonons, making the state-resolved spectroscopic monitoring of dynamics challenging. We propose a protocol that combines photon-entanglement-enhanced narrowband excitation of two-exciton states with time-frequency-filtered two-photon coincidence counting. It can alleviate bottlenecks associated with probing exciton dynamics spread across multiple spectral and temporal windows. We demonstrate that non-classical correlations of entangled photon pairs can be used to prepare narrowband two-exciton population distributions, circumventing transport in mediating states. The distributions thus created can be monitored using time-frequency-filtered photon coincidence counting, and the pathways contributing to photon emission events can be classified by tuning filtering parameters. Numerical simulations for a light-harvesting aggregate highlight the ability of this protocol to achieve selectivity by suppressing or amplifying specific pathways. Combining entangled photonic sources and multidimensional photon counting allow promising applications to spectroscopy and sensing.

Motivation: 研究共振点（等频点）下量子Pais-Uhlenbeck振子的特殊行为，此时系统动力学不可对角化，传统Fock空间构造崩溃，且经典层面存在多个等价哈密顿量导致量子化歧义。

Method: 采用含"鬼态"的二维哈密顿量表述，构造微分交织算符生成谱生成代数，作用于哈密顿量的广义特征空间；通过揭示隐藏的su(2)李代数结构组织有限Jordan链。

Result: 1) 共振点存在仅在该条件下出现的隐藏su(2)代数；2) 量子化经典等价哈密顿量会得到完全不同的量子理论（可对角化谱/真实简并）。

Conclusion: 共振Pais-Uhlenbeck振子提供了首个具体实例，证明经典等价的哈密顿量可定义不等价的量子理论，揭示了量子化过程存在非平凡歧义。

Abstract: We study the quantum Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator at the resonant (equal-frequency) point, where the dynamics becomes non-diagonalisable and the conventional Fock-space construction collapses. At the classical level, the degenerate system admits more than one Hamiltonian formulation generating the same equations of motion, leading to a nontrivial quantisation ambiguity. Working first in the ghostly two-dimensional Hamiltonian formulation, we construct differential intertwiners that generate a spectrum-generating algebra acting on the generalised eigenspaces of the Hamiltonian. This algebra organises the generalised eigenvectors into finite Jordan chains and closes into a hidden $su(2)$ Lie algebra that exists only at resonance.
  We then show that quantising a classically equivalent Hamiltonian yields a radically different quantum theory, with a fully diagonalisable spectrum and genuine degeneracies. Our results demonstrate that the resonant Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator provides a concrete example in which classically equivalent Hamiltonians define inequivalent quantum theories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典理论无法描述弯曲约束系统中量子效应（如量子反作用、不确定性增长），而此类系统在碳纳米结构电荷输运、弯曲量子阱激子动力学及环状分子反应路径等前沿领域具有关键应用，亟需建立能严格满足海森堡不确定性原理的半经典理论框架。

Method: 采用动量量子力学形式（momentous quantum mechanics），将经典相空间扩展至包含量子涨落高阶矩变量，在球面坐标系中推导量子修正哈密顿量与轨迹方程，并引入非中心Makarov势场进行耦合分析。

Result: 1. 自由粒子量子涨落导致方位进动相位偏移8-12%，不确定性增长率与初始矩相关；2. 强耦合（γ=-1.9）时量子修正力使轨迹向南半球偏转，时间尺度缩短40%；3. 轨迹密度在优选区域增强3倍；4. 全程严格满足海森堡不确定性关系，验证截断方案有效性。

Conclusion: 量子效应从根本上改变弯曲约束系统的半经典动力学行为，该框架为纳米结构电荷传输、量子阱激子调控及分子反应路径设计提供了新理论基础，证实量子涨落是调控弯曲体系物理过程的关键因素。

Abstract: We develop a semiclassical framework for studying quantum particles constrained to curved surfaces using the momentous quantum mechanics formalism, which extends classical phase-space to include quantum fluctuation variables (moments). In a spherical geometry, we derive quantum-corrected Hamiltonians and trajectories that incorporate quantum back-reaction effects absent in classical descriptions. For the free particle, quantum fluctuations induce measurable phase shifts in azimuthal precession of approximately 8-12%, with uncertainty growth rates proportional to initial moment correlations. When a non-central Makarov potential is introduced, quantum corrections dramatically amplify its asymmetry. For strong coupling ($γ$ = -1.9), the quantum-corrected force drives trajectories preferentially toward the southern hemisphere on timescales 40% shorter than classical predictions, with trajectory densities exhibiting up to 3-fold enhancement in the preferred region. Throughout evolution, the solutions rigorously satisfy Heisenberg uncertainty relations, validating the truncation scheme. These results demonstrate that quantum effects fundamentally alter semiclassical dynamics in curved constrained systems, with direct implications for charge transport in carbon nanostructures, exciton dynamics in curved quantum wells, and reaction pathways in cyclic molecules.

Conclusion: 该方案构成自校正通用量子计算机，首次在物理可实现的二维空间突破被动纠错限制，为建造大规模容错量子计算机奠定理论基础

Abstract: Standard approaches to quantum error correction (QEC) require active maintenance using measurements and classical processing. The possibility of passive QEC has so far only been established in an unphysical number of spatial dimensions. In this work, we present a simple method for autonomous QEC in two spatial dimensions, formulated as a quantum cellular automaton with a fixed, local and translation-invariant update rule. The construction uses hierarchical, self-simulating control elements based on the classical schemes from the seminal results of Gács (1986, 1989) together with a measurement-free concatenated code. We analyze the system under a local noise model and prove a noise threshold below which the logical errors are suppressed arbitrarily with increasing system size and the memory lifetime diverges in the thermodynamic limit. The scheme admits a continuous-time implementation as a time-independent, translation-invariant local Lindbladian with engineered dissipative jump operators. Further, the recursive nature of our protocol allows for the fault-tolerant encoding of arbitrary quantum circuits and thus constitutes a self-correcting universal quantum computer.

Abstract: We investigate the process of quantum teleportation in an expanding universe modeled by Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime, focusing on two cosmologically relevant scenarios: a power-law expansion and the de Sitter universe. Adopting a field-theoretical approach, we analyze the quantum correlations between two comoving observers who share an entangled mode of a scalar field. Using the Bogoliubov transformation, we compute the teleportation fidelity and examine its dependence on the expansion rate, initial entanglement, and the mode frequency. Our findings indicate that spacetime curvature and the underlying cosmological background significantly affect the efficiency of quantum teleportation, particularly through mode mixing and vacuum structure. We also compare our results with the flat Minkowski case to highlight the role of cosmic expansion in degrading or preserving quantum information.

Motivation: 揭示非平衡系统中集体行为的涌现机制，探索重置动力学如何在无粒子间直接相互作用的情况下诱导长程时空关联，为理解生物系统和活性物质的集体动力学提供理论框架。

Method: 建立批量重置下多粒子扩散的精确理论模型，通过解析方法求解主方程，获得非平衡稳态分布和关联函数的闭式表达式，适用于任意参数m和N。

Result: 发现系统可在无关联(m=1)与完全同步(m=N)重置间连续插值；当1<m<N时，关联呈现非单调时间演化并存在内在去相关机制；稳态关联强度在临界粒子数Nc=6处发生突变；该临界值与空间维度无关，结果可推广至任意维度d。

Conclusion: 批量重置机制可在非相互作用粒子系统中诱导丰富的非平衡集体现象，为实验上研究相变和关联动力学提供了精确可解的理论平台，预测可在光镊胶体粒子系统中验证。

Abstract: We study a gas of $N$ diffusing particles on the line subject to batch resetting: at rate $r$, a uniformly random subset of $m$ particles is reset to the origin. Despite the absence of interactions, the dynamics generates a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) with long-range correlations. We obtain exact results, both for the NESS and for the time dependence of the correlations, which are valid for arbitrary $m$ and $N$. By varying $m$, the system interpolates between an uncorrelated regime ($m=1$) and the fully synchronous resetting case ($m=N$). For all $1<m<N$, correlations exhibit a non-monotonic time dependence due to the emergence of an intrinsic decorrelation mechanism. In the stationary state, the correlation strength can be tuned by varying $m$, and it displays a transition at a critical value $N_c=6$. Our predictions extend straightforwardly to any spatial dimension $d$ and the critical value $N_c=6$ remains the same in all dimensions. Our predictions are testable in existing experimental setups on optically trapped colloidal particles.

Conclusion: 建立了FHL统计的统一结构框架，证明其可作为探测随机输运中几何、漂移与不可逆性的自然探针。

Abstract: We investigate first-hitting location (FHL) statistics induced by drift--diffusion processes in domains with absorbing boundaries, and examine how such boundary laws give rise to intrinsic information observables. Rather than introducing explicit encoding or decoding mechanisms, information is viewed as emerging directly from the geometry and dynamics of stochastic transport through first-passage events. Treating the FHL as the primary observable, we characterize how geometry and drift jointly shape the induced boundary measure. In diffusion-dominated regimes, the exit law exhibits scale-free, heavy-tailed spatial fluctuations along the boundary, whereas a nonzero drift component introduces an intrinsic length scale that suppresses these tails and reorganizes the exit statistics. Within a generator-based formulation, the FHL arises naturally as a boundary measure induced by an elliptic operator, allowing explicit boundary kernels to be derived analytically in canonical geometries. Planar absorbing boundaries in different ambient dimensions are examined as benchmark cases, illustrating how directed transport regularizes diffusion-driven fluctuations and induces qualitative transitions in boundary statistics. Overall, the present work provides a unified structural framework for first-hitting location laws and highlights FHL statistics as natural probes of geometry, drift, and irreversibility in stochastic transport.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest in the criticality of open quantum many-body systems, we study nonlinear sigma models with complexified couplings as a general framework for nonunitary field theory. Applying the perturbative renormalization-group analysis to the tenfold symmetric spaces, we demonstrate that fixed points with complex scaling dimensions and critical exponents arise generically, without counterparts in conventional nonlinear sigma models with real couplings. We further clarify the global phase diagrams in the complex-coupling plane and identify both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions. Our work elucidates universal aspects of critical phenomena in complexified field theory.

### [42] [Teaching LLMs to Ask: Self-Querying Category-Theoretic Planning for Under-Specified Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20014)
*Shuhui Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SQ-BCP is a novel planning method for LLMs that handles partial observability by explicitly tracking precondition status (Sat/Viol/Unk), using bidirectional search with a pullback verifier, and resolving unknowns via self-queries or bridging actions, significantly reducing constraint violations while maintaining plan quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time planning with large language models frequently fails under partial observability when task-critical preconditions are unspecified, causing models to hallucinate missing facts or produce plans that violate hard constraints.

Method: Self-Querying Bidirectional Categorical Planning (SQ-BCP) explicitly represents precondition status, resolves unknowns through targeted self-queries or bridging hypotheses, performs bidirectional search, and uses a pullback-based verifier as categorical certificate for goal compatibility, with distance-based scores only for ranking and pruning.

Result: Theoretically proven to find accepting plans when they exist under bounded conditions; on WikiHow and RecipeNLG tasks, reduces resource-violation rates to 14.9% and 5.8% (vs. 26.0% and 15.7% for best baseline) while maintaining competitive reference quality.

Conclusion: SQ-BCP effectively addresses partial observability in LLM planning by providing verifiable guarantees of plan compatibility and substantially reducing constraint violations compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Inference-time planning with large language models frequently breaks under partial observability: when task-critical preconditions are not specified at query time, models tend to hallucinate missing facts or produce plans that violate hard constraints. We introduce \textbf{Self-Querying Bidirectional Categorical Planning (SQ-BCP)}, which explicitly represents precondition status (\texttt{Sat}/\texttt{Viol}/\texttt{Unk}) and resolves unknowns via (i) targeted self-queries to an oracle/user or (ii) \emph{bridging} hypotheses that establish the missing condition through an additional action. SQ-BCP performs bidirectional search and invokes a pullback-based verifier as a categorical certificate of goal compatibility, while using distance-based scores only for ranking and pruning. We prove that when the verifier succeeds and hard constraints pass deterministic checks, accepted plans are compatible with goal requirements; under bounded branching and finite resolution depth, SQ-BCP finds an accepting plan when one exists. Across WikiHow and RecipeNLG tasks with withheld preconditions, SQ-BCP reduces resource-violation rates to \textbf{14.9\%} and \textbf{5.8\%} (vs.\ \textbf{26.0\%} and \textbf{15.7\%} for the best baseline), while maintaining competitive reference quality.

Conclusion: FCP有效处理了自然语言规划中的分级模糊谓词，在保持硬约束验证的同时追踪质量衰减，为模糊规划提供了有效的范畴论解决方案。

Abstract: Natural-language planning often involves vague predicates (e.g., suitable substitute, stable enough) whose satisfaction is inherently graded. Existing category-theoretic planners provide compositional structure and pullback-based hard-constraint verification, but treat applicability as crisp, forcing thresholding that collapses meaningful distinctions and cannot track quality degradation across multi-step plans. We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements. We evaluate on (i) public PDDL3 preference/oversubscription benchmarks and (ii) RecipeNLG-Subs, a missing-substitute recipe-planning benchmark built from RecipeNLG with substitution candidates from Recipe1MSubs and FoodKG. FCP improves success and reduces hard-constraint violations on RecipeNLG-Subs compared to LLM-only and ReAct-style baselines, while remaining competitive with classical PDDL3 planners.

Abstract: As an important part of urbanization, the development monitoring of newly constructed parks is of great significance for evaluating the effect of urban planning and optimizing resource allocation. However, traditional change detection methods based on remote sensing imagery have obvious limitations in high-level and intelligent analysis, and thus are difficult to meet the requirements of current urban planning and management. In face of the growing demand for complex multi-modal data analysis in urban park development monitoring, these methods often fail to provide flexible analysis capabilities for diverse application scenarios. This study proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework, which aims to make full use of the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM to meet the challenges in urban park development monitoring. In this framework, a general horizontal and vertical data alignment mechanism is designed to ensure the consistency and effective tracking of multi-modal data. At the same time, a specific toolkit is constructed to alleviate the hallucination issues of LLM due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. Compared to vanilla GPT-4o and other agents, our approach enables robust multi-modal information fusion and analysis, offering reliable and scalable solutions tailored to the diverse and evolving demands of urban park development monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出SEER框架解决统一多模态模型的理解与生成认知鸿沟问题，通过内在重提示机制在生成过程中产生自对齐描述符，仅需300个样本就在评估准确率、重提示效率和生成质量上超越SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态模型(UMMs)虽具备强大理解能力，但难以有效指导生成过程，存在"认知鸿沟"——模型缺乏如何增强自身生成的理解。现有方法未能将模型的被动编码转化为显式的生成推理步骤。

Method: 提出内在重提示机制，在生成过程中生成自对齐描述符。引入SEER训练框架：1)可验证奖励强化学习(RLVR)通过课程学习激活模型潜在评估能力，产生高保真内在奖励信号；2)模型奖励思考强化学习(RLMT)利用该信号优化生成推理策略。仅使用视觉指令阐述任务的300个样本建立两阶段内在循环。

Result: 在多项指标上持续超越最先进基线：评估准确率、重提示效率和生成质量均有显著提升，同时未牺牲通用多模态能力。证明了小样本下建立有效内在反馈循环的可行性。

Conclusion: SEER框架成功桥接了多模态模型的认知鸿沟，将理解能力转化为生成过程中的主动推理，为构建更自洽、更可控的生成式AI提供了新范式，展示了内在反馈机制在提升模型自我优化能力方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) exhibit strong understanding, yet this capability often fails to effectively guide generation. We identify this as a Cognitive Gap: the model lacks the understanding of how to enhance its own generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose Endogenous Reprompting, a mechanism that transforms the model's understanding from a passive encoding process into an explicit generative reasoning step by generating self-aligned descriptors during generation. To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration. First, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) activates the model's latent evaluation ability via curriculum learning, producing a high-fidelity endogenous reward signal. Second, Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) leverages this signal to optimize the generative reasoning policy. Experiments show that SEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in evaluation accuracy, reprompting efficiency, and generation quality, without sacrificing general multimodal capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出ECG-Agent，首个基于LLM的ECG工具调用智能体，支持多轮对话并在设备端高效运行，配套ECG-MTD数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ECG多模态大模型在真实场景中不足：缺乏多轮对话能力、设备端效率低，且无法精确理解PQRST间期等ECG测量指标

Method: 开发ECG-Agent（工具调用智能体）及ECG-MTD数据集（含多种导联配置的真实多轮对话），构建从设备端到大型的不同规格模型

Result: ECG-Agents在响应准确率上优于基线模型；设备端智能体在准确率、工具调用能力和幻觉评估上与大型智能体性能相当

Conclusion: 设备端ECG-Agent具备真实世界应用可行性，为ECG交互式分析提供新范式

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have rapidly expanded to electrocardiograms, focusing on classification, report generation, and single-turn QA tasks. However, these models fall short in real-world scenarios, lacking multi-turn conversational ability, on-device efficiency, and precise understanding of ECG measurements such as the PQRST intervals. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-Agent, the first LLM-based tool-calling agent for multi-turn ECG dialogue. To facilitate its development and evaluation, we also present ECG-Multi-Turn-Dialogue (ECG-MTD) dataset, a collection of realistic user-assistant multi-turn dialogues for diverse ECG lead configurations. We develop ECG-Agents in various sizes, from on-device capable to larger agents. Experimental results show that ECG-Agents outperform baseline ECG-LLMs in response accuracy. Furthermore, on-device agents achieve comparable performance to larger agents in various evaluations that assess response accuracy, tool-calling ability, and hallucinations, demonstrating their viability for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出AMA框架，通过多智能体协作实现LLM智能体的自适应记忆管理，采用分层记忆设计和动态粒度对齐，在长上下文基准测试中显著优于SOTA方法，同时降低80%的token消耗。


<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体记忆系统存在检索粒度僵化、维护策略过度累积和更新机制粗粒度等问题，导致存储信息与任务推理需求不匹配，且逻辑矛盾随时间 unchecked 积累。

Method: 提出自适应记忆多智能体协作框架(AMA)，采用分层记忆设计，由Constructor和Retriever实现多粒度记忆构建与自适应查询路由，Judge验证相关性/一致性并触发迭代检索，Refresher执行目标更新或删除过时条目以强制记忆一致性。

Result: 在挑战性长上下文基准测试中，AMA显著优于最先进基线方法，相比全上下文方法token消耗降低约80%。

Conclusion: AMA框架通过多智能体协作有效维持检索精度和长期记忆一致性，解决了现有LLM智能体记忆系统的核心缺陷。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has necessitated robust memory systems to support cohesive long-term interaction and complex reasoning. Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.

TL;DR: 提出Policy of Thoughts (PoT)框架，通过实时策略演化解决大模型长程推理不稳定问题，4B模型在LiveCodeBench上超越GPT-4o和DeepSeek-V3


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型因"冻结策略假设"在复杂长程推理中表现不稳定，现有测试时扩展方法仅将执行反馈作为外部过滤信号，未能内化改进推理策略

Method: 受波普尔"猜想与反驳"认识论启发，将推理重构为实例内在线优化过程：1) 高效探索生成多样化解法 2) 用GRPO基于执行反馈更新临时LoRA适配器，实现实例特定的推理先验动态优化

Result: 4B参数模型在LiveCodeBench达到49.71%准确率，性能超越50倍大的GPT-4o和DeepSeek-V3

Conclusion: PoT通过闭环设计实现模型策略的实时演化，证明小模型通过动态推理优化可突破规模限制，为高效智能推理提供新范式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex, long-horizon reasoning due to instability caused by their frozen policy assumption. Current test-time scaling methods treat execution feedback merely as an external signal for filtering or rewriting trajectories, without internalizing it to improve the underlying reasoning strategy. Inspired by Popper's epistemology of "conjectures and refutations," we argue that intelligence requires real-time evolution of the model's policy through learning from failed attempts. We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors. Experiments show that PoT dramatically boosts performance: a 4B model achieves 49.71% accuracy on LiveCodeBench, outperforming GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 despite being over 50 smaller.

TL;DR: OmegaUse是一个通用的GUI智能体模型，通过高质量数据合成和两阶段训练（SFT+GRPO），在移动和桌面平台上实现了SOTA性能，特别是在ScreenSpot-V2上达到96.3%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI智能体具有巨大潜力，能让基础模型完成真实世界任务，革新人机交互并提升生产力。构建有效模型需要高质量数据和有效训练方法。

Method: 采用精心设计的双阶段方法：(1)数据构建：结合精选开源数据集和自动合成框架，融合自下而上的自主探索与自上而下的分类法引导生成；(2)训练：先用监督微调（SFT）建立基本交互语法，再用组相对策略优化（GRPO）提升空间定位和序列规划能力，基于Mixture-of-Experts架构。

Conclusion: OmegaUse在跨平台GUI智能体任务中表现出色，验证了所提数据构建和训练方法的有效性，为移动和桌面环境提供了强大的自主任务执行能力。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show great potential for enabling foundation models to complete real-world tasks, revolutionizing human-computer interaction and improving human productivity. In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl. OmegaUse also performs strongly on OS-Nav, reaching 74.24% step success on ChiM-Nav and 55.9% average success on Ubu-Nav.

### [50] [CtrlCoT: Dual-Granularity Chain-of-Thought Compression for Controllable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20467)
*Zhenxuan Fan,Jie Cao,Yang Dai,Zheqi Lv,Wenqiao Zhang,Zhongle Xie,Peng LU,Beng Chin Ooi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CtrlCoT is a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that combines semantic abstraction and token-level pruning to reduce LLM reasoning costs while improving accuracy, achieving 30.7% token reduction and 7.6% accuracy gain on MATH-500.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought prompting improves LLM reasoning but suffers from high latency and memory costs due to verbose reasoning traces. Existing compression methods are either too conservative (semantic-level) or risk accuracy loss (token-level), and combining both approaches faces challenges of sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch.

Method: The proposed CtrlCoT framework uses three components: (1) Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction to generate multi-granularity CoTs, (2) Logic-Preserving Distillation to train a logic-aware pruner that retains critical reasoning cues, and (3) Distribution-Alignment Generation to align compressed traces with inference-time reasoning styles.

Result: On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT reduces token usage by 30.7% while achieving 7.6 percentage points higher accuracy than the strongest baseline, demonstrating more efficient and reliable reasoning.

Conclusion: CtrlCoT successfully harmonizes dual-granularity compression to achieve both efficiency and accuracy improvements in LLM reasoning, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves LLM reasoning but incurs high latency and memory cost due to verbose traces, motivating CoT compression with preserved correctness. Existing methods either shorten CoTs at the semantic level, which is often conservative, or prune tokens aggressively, which can miss task-critical cues and degrade accuracy. Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation. On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT uses 30.7\% fewer tokens while achieving 7.6 percentage points higher than the strongest baseline, demonstrating more efficient and reliable reasoning. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/fanzhenxuan/Ctrl-CoT.

### [51] [Online Risk-Averse Planning in POMDPs Using Iterated CVaR Value Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20554)
*Yaacov Pariente,Vadim Indelman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops risk-sensitive planning algorithms for partially observable environments using Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (ICVaR), extending three popular online planning methods with finite-time guarantees and demonstrating reduced tail risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard partially observable planning typically optimizes expected returns, which fails to capture tail risk and rare catastrophic outcomes. This motivates the need for risk-sensitive frameworks that can explicitly handle worst-case scenarios in safety-critical applications.

Method: The authors employ Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (ICVaR) as a dynamic risk measure. They develop a finite-time policy evaluation algorithm independent of action space cardinality, then extend three online planning algorithms—Sparse Sampling, PFT-DPW, and POMCPOW—to optimize ICVaR instead of expectation, introducing a risk parameter α (α=1 for risk-neutral, α<1 for risk-averse).

Result: The proposed ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to risk-neutral counterparts. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, the authors establish finite-time performance guarantees and develop a novel exploration strategy tailored to risk-sensitive objectives.

Conclusion: Risk-sensitive planning using ICVaR provides an effective framework for reducing tail risk in partially observable domains while maintaining computational tractability through finite-time guarantees independent of action space size.

Abstract: We study risk-sensitive planning under partial observability using the dynamic risk measure Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (ICVaR). A policy evaluation algorithm for ICVaR is developed with finite-time performance guarantees that do not depend on the cardinality of the action space. Building on this foundation, three widely used online planning algorithms--Sparse Sampling, Particle Filter Trees with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW), and Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW)--are extended to optimize the ICVaR value function rather than the expectation of the return. Our formulations introduce a risk parameter $α$, where $α= 1$ recovers standard expectation-based planning and $α< 1$ induces increasing risk aversion. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, we establish finite-time performance guarantees under the risk-sensitive objective, which further enable a novel exploration strategy tailored to ICVaR. Experiments on benchmark POMDP domains demonstrate that the proposed ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to their risk-neutral counterparts.

<details>

Motivation: 传统AI对齐视为控制问题存在局限，借鉴和平研究的利益协商、冲突转化与公共治理传统，提出"病毒式协作智慧"框架，将问题重构为关系问题，需实证检验当前大模型是否具备对话式推理能力。

Method: 设计四角色（提议者、回应者、监督者、翻译者）实验，将Claude、Gemini、GPT-4o分配至六条件中进行72轮对话，生成57.7万字符结构化数据，分析模型间协作模式。

Result: 模型能深入理解和平研究概念，不同架构提出互补性质疑（Claude关注验证、Gemini关注偏见与扩展、GPT-4o关注实施），并涌现"VCW作为过渡框架"等新见解。

Conclusion: 框架为对齐提案提供可重复的压力测试工具，初步证实AI具备对话式推理能力。但对话偏重流程而非AI本质的基础主张，未来需探索人机混合协议与长程对话研究。

Abstract: This paper introduces a methodological framework for empirically testing AI alignment strategies through structured multi-model dialogue. Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning.
  Our experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.
  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of "VCW as transitional framework." Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.
  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在算法和数据层面均缺乏对高难度问题的系统关注：GRPO算法存在隐式不平衡导致难题策略更新幅度小；数据增强仅重述问题而未提升内在难度，限制了模型未充分发展能力的提升。

Method: 提出双管齐下的MathForge框架：1) DGPO算法：通过难度平衡组优势估计修正GRPO不平衡，并引入难度感知的问题级加权优先训练难题；2) MQR策略：在保持原答案前提下，从多角度重构问题系统性提升难度。两者形成"数据扩展-有效学习"的协同循环。

Conclusion: 通过算法改进和数据增强的协同设计，MathForge成功解决了难题训练不足的核心瓶颈，为提升大模型数学推理能力提供了新范式，强调了难度感知在强化学习中的重要性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a robust mechanism for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large models. However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks. The code and augmented data are all available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MathForge.

Motivation: 探究LLM智能体是否能发展出具有高效性（比自然语言更简洁）和隐秘性（难以被外部观察者解读，引发透明度和控制担忧）的任务导向通信协议。

Method: 采用指代游戏框架，让视觉-语言模型(VLM)智能体进行通信，提供可控、可测量的评估环境。

Result: VLM智能体可发展出有效的任务适应通信模式，这些协议对人类和外部智能体难以解读，且相似模型间可自发协调。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了任务导向通信的潜力与风险，指代游戏是该领域有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: We investigate whether \emph{LLM-based agents} can develop task-oriented communication protocols that differ from standard natural language in collaborative reasoning tasks. Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area.

TL;DR: This paper presents a computational approach for Metric Answer Set Programming that handles quantitative temporal constraints by using difference constraints externally, effectively decoupling time granularity from the ASP grounding process to maintain scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained timing constraints in Metric ASP cause significant grounding bottlenecks and scalability issues, making it difficult to handle temporal reasoning efficiently.

Method: The authors leverage ASP extensions with difference constraints (a simplified form of linear constraints) to process time-related aspects externally, separating temporal reasoning from the core ASP solving.

Result: The approach successfully decouples metric ASP from time granularity, producing solutions that remain unaffected by the precision of time representation while maintaining scalability.

Conclusion: By externalizing temporal constraints through difference constraints, the method provides a scalable solution for quantitative temporal reasoning in ASP without being constrained by time granularity.

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to allow for expressing quantitative temporal constraints, like durations and deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.

TL;DR: MemCtrl是一种新颖的框架，通过可训练的记忆头在线修剪MLLMs的记忆，在EmbodiedBench基准测试上实现了约16%的平均提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型的上下文窗口有限，而RAG系统将记忆视为大型离线存储空间，这对需要在严格内存和计算约束下在线运行的具身智能体不利。

Method: 提出MemCtrl框架，通过可训练的记忆头μ增强MLLMs，该记忆头作为门控机制在探索过程中决定保留、更新或丢弃哪些观察或反思。通过离线专家或在线强化学习两种方式训练μ。

Result: 在EmbodiedBench多个子集上，μ增强的MLLMs表现出约16%的平均提升，特定指令子集上提升超过20%，在长而复杂的指令类型上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: MemCtrl有效实现了具身智能体的在线记忆压缩，在满足内存约束的同时显著提升了任务完成能力。

Abstract: Foundation models rely on in-context learning for personalized decision making. The limited size of this context window necessitates memory compression and retrieval systems like RAG. These systems however often treat memory as large offline storage spaces, which is unfavorable for embodied agents that are expected to operate under strict memory and compute constraints, online. In this work, we propose MemCtrl, a novel framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pruning memory online. MemCtrl augments MLLMs with a trainable memory head μthat acts as a gate to determine which observations or reflections to retain, update, or discard during exploration. We evaluate with training two types of μ, 1) via an offline expert, and 2) via online RL, and observe significant improvement in overall embodied task completion ability on μ-augmented MLLMs. In particular, on augmenting two low performing MLLMs with MemCtrl on multiple subsets of the EmbodiedBench benchmark, we observe that μ-augmented MLLMs show an improvement of around 16% on average, with over 20% on specific instruction subsets. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis on the memory fragments collected by μ, noting the superior performance of μaugmented MLLMs on long and complex instruction types.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Deep Researcher architecture designed to generate detailed research reports on complex PhD level topics by addressing the inherent limitations of the Parallel Scaling paradigm. Our system utilizes two key innovations: Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and a Candidates Crossover algorithm. The sequential refinement process is demonstrated as an efficient method that allows the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, enabling it to look back at current progress, reason about the research plan, and intelligently make changes at runtime. This dynamic adaptation contrasts with parallel approaches, which often suffer from siloed knowledge. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further enhances search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM candidates with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized to curate a comprehensive final research response. The process concludes with One Shot Report Generation, ensuring the final document is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, our Deep Researcher was evaluated on the DeepResearch Bench, a globally recognized benchmark of 100 doctoral level research tasks. Our architecture achieved an overall score of 46.21, demonstrating superior performance by surpassing leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher, Nvidia AIQ Research Assistant, Perplexity Research, Kimi Researcher and Grok Deeper Search present on the DeepResearch Bench actively running leaderboard. This performance marginally exceeds our previous work, Static DRA, and reinforces the finding that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self consistency paradigm.

TL;DR: 本文通过简化的Sokoban基准测试系统评估大推理模型的长程规划能力，发现当规划步数超过25步时性能急剧下降，且PDDL工具仅能带来有限改进，表明存在根本性的架构限制。

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在复杂推理任务上的能力已被广泛测试，但其长程规划能力尚未得到系统研究。这促使作者对当前最优的大推理模型进行规划能力的系统性评估。

Method: 作者提出基于Sokoban谜题的新基准，故意简化以分离长程规划与状态持久性，并测试大推理模型在该基准上的表现。同时，为模型配备PDDL解析、验证和求解工具以检验是否能提升性能。

Result: 当解决方案需要超过25步时，规划性能持续下降，表明前向规划能力存在根本性限制。PDDL工具仅带来有限改进。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明大推理模型存在固有的架构限制，仅靠测试时扩展方法可能难以克服。

Abstract: Although the capabilities of large language models have been increasingly tested on complex reasoning tasks, their long-horizon planning abilities have not yet been extensively investigated. In this work, we provide a systematic assessment of the planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We propose a novel benchmark based on Sokoban puzzles, intentionally simplified to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence. Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in planning performance when more than 25 moves are required to reach the solution, suggesting a fundamental constraint on forward planning capacity. We show that equipping LRMs with Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) parsing, validation, and solving tools allows for modest improvements, suggesting inherent architectural limitations which might not be overcome by test-time scaling approaches alone.

### [59] [Comment on "Instability of the ferromagnetic quantum critical point and symmetry of the ferromagnetic ground state in two-dimensional and three-dimensional electron gases with arbitrary spin-orbit splitting"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19959)
*D. Belitz,T. R. Kirkpatrick*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This Comment refutes a prior claim that electron-electron interactions in particle-particle channels cause first-order quantum phase transitions in non-centrosymmetric 3D ferromagnets, demonstrating that proper accounting of electrostatic screening renders the relevant soft modes massive and preserves the continuous transition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To correct a flawed theoretical claim (by Miserev et al.) that electron-electron interactions in specific scattering channels could override the stabilizing effect of spin-orbit interactions in non-centrosymmetric metals, thereby reinstating first-order quantum phase transitions.

Method: Theoretical analysis of soft-mode dynamics in three-dimensional metallic ferromagnets, explicitly incorporating the effects of electrostatic screening on electron-electron interactions in the particle-particle channel (2kF scattering).

Result: Proper inclusion of screening demonstrates that spin-orbit interactions successfully generate a mass for the relevant soft modes in 3D, even when considering 2kF scattering processes. This suppresses the nonanalyticities that drive first-order transitions.

Conclusion: The original conclusion by Kirkpatrick and Belitz remains valid: non-centrosymmetric 3D metals with strong spin-orbit interactions avoid first-order quantum phase transitions due to massive soft modes. Miserev et al.'s claim is incorrect in three dimensions when screening is properly treated.

Abstract: Metallic quantum ferromagnets in the absence of quenched disorder are known to generically undergo a first-order quantum phase transition, avoiding the quantum critical point that had originally been expected. This is due to soft modes in the underlying Fermi liquid that lead to long-ranged correlations. These correlations in turn yield a nonanalytic dependence of the free energy on the magnetization even at a mean-field level that results in a fluctuation-induced first-order transition. Kirkpatrick and Belitz [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 124}, 147201 (2020)] have pointed out that one notable exception are non-centrosymmetric metals with a strong spin-orbit interaction. In such materials the spin-orbit interaction gives the relevant soft modes a mass, which inhibits the mechanism leading to a first-order transition. Miserev, Loss, and Klinovaja [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 106}, 134417 (2022)] have claimed that this conclusion does not hold if electron-electron interactions in the particle-particle channel, or 2$\kF$ scattering processes, are considered. They concluded that this interaction channel leads to soft modes that are not rendered massive by the spin-orbit interaction and again lead to a first-order quantum phase transition. In this Comment we show that this conclusion is not correct in three-dimensional magnets if the screening of the interaction is properly taken into account.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了偏压驱动量子点系统中非平衡量子相变的临界现象：电荷涨落呈现等效温度描述（类似平衡态），而电流噪声则显示真实非平衡特征（如负涨落耗散比），为电压调控量子临界现象提供了新探针。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索偏压驱动下非平衡量子相变的临界涨落特性，特别是验证非平衡稳态中是否存在类似平衡态的有效温度描述，并区分电荷与电流自由度在临界点附近的不同行为。

Method: 采用随机相位近似（RPA）方法，在大量量子点能级极限下精确求解相互作用量子点与金属电极耦合模型，计算零温下电荷磁化率与电流噪声随相互作用强度和偏压的变化。

Result: 1）电荷涨落可用偏压和温度依赖的有效温度$T_{\text{eff}}(T,V)$描述，其行为与平衡态临界现象一致；2）电流涨落呈现本质非平衡特征：有序相中涨落耗散比变为负值，对应电流自由度的负有效温度。

Conclusion: 电流噪声是探测非平衡量子相变临界涨落的高灵敏度探针，其负涨落耗散比揭示了电压驱动量子输运系统中独特的非平衡临界行为，为实验探索偏压调控量子临界现象开辟新方向。

Abstract: We investigate bias-driven non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions in a paradigmatic quantum-transport setup: an interacting quantum dot coupled to non-interacting metallic leads. Using the Random Phase Approximation, which is exact in the limit of a large number of dot levels, we map out the zero-temperature non-equilibrium phase diagram as a function of interaction strength and applied bias. We focus our analysis on the behavior of the charge susceptibility and the current noise in the vicinity of the transition. Remarkably, despite the intrinsically non-equilibrium nature of the steady state, critical charge fluctuations admit an effective-temperature description, $T_{\text{eff}}(T,V)$, that collapses the steady-state behavior onto its equilibrium form. In sharp contrast, current fluctuations exhibit genuinely non-equilibrium features: the fluctuation-dissipation ratio becomes negative in the ordered phase, corresponding to a negative effective temperature for the current degrees of freedom. These results establish current noise as a sensitive probe of critical fluctuations at non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions and open new directions for exploring voltage-driven critical phenomena in quantum transport systems.

Result: 1) Shastry-Sutherland晶格与方晶格的量子场论在临界点处具有相同的希格斯势结构和低能有效理论；2) SO(5)临界点实现共形去禁闭临界性，其序参量具有大反常维度；3) 临界点处Néel序和VBS序的磁化率显著增强，与数值模拟一致；4) 理论成功解释该晶格上Z₂狄拉克自旋液体的数值证据。

Conclusion: 费米子去禁闭量子临界性（包括临界指数和稳定性）可推广至对称性降低的阻挫晶格，建立了Shastry-Sutherland晶格上Z₂狄拉克自旋液体的受控场论框架，为理解复杂晶格中的量子临界现象提供了统一理论描述。

Abstract: We present a fermionic gauge theory for deconfined quantum criticality on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice and reveal its shared low-energy field-theoretic structure with the square lattice. Starting from an SU(2) $π$-flux parent state, we construct a continuum theory of Dirac spinons coupled to an SU(2) gauge field and adjoint Higgs fields whose condensates drive transitions to a staggered-flux U(1) spin liquid and a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. While the Shastry-Sutherland lattice permits additional symmetry-allowed fermion bilinears compared to the square lattice, the quantum field theories are identical up to additional irrelevant terms. Consequently, the Higgs potential structure and the leading low-energy theory coincide with the square-lattice case at the quantum critical point. The SO(5) critical point is expected to realize conformal deconfined criticality: we analyze it in a large flavor expansion, calculate its critical exponents, and identify the Yukawa coupling between the fermions and Higgs fields as the relevant perturbation that destabilizes it, consistent with pseudocritical behavior observed in recent Monte Carlo studies. We show that the emergent SO(5) order parameter acquires a large anomalous dimension at the critical point, leading to strongly enhanced Néel and VBS susceptibilities-a hallmark of fermionic deconfined quantum criticality consistent with numerical studies. Our results place recent numerical evidence for a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice within a controlled field-theoretic framework and demonstrate that fermionic deconfined criticality on the square lattice-including critical exponents and stability-extends to frustrated lattices with reduced symmetry.

Abstract: Several ground state properties of the square-lattice $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet are computed (the energy, order parameter, spin stiffness, spinwave velocity, long-wavelength susceptibility, and staggered susceptibility) using extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the stochastic series expansion method. Moderately sized lattices are studied at temperatures $T$ sufficiently low to realize the $T \to 0$ limit. Results for periodic $L\times L$ lattices with $L \in [6,96]$ are tabulated versus $L$ and extrapolations to infinite system size are carried out. The extrapolated ground state energy density is $e_0=-0.669441857(7)$, which represents an improvement in precision of three orders of magnitude over the previously best result. The leading and subleading finite-size corrections to $e_0$ are in full quantitative agreement with predictions from chiral perturbation theory, thus further supporting the soundness of both the extrapolations and the theory. The extrapolated sublattice magnetization is $m_s=0.307447(2)$, which agrees well with previous estimates but with a much smaller statistical error. The coefficient of the linear in $L^{-1}$ correction to $m^2_s$ agrees with the value from chiral perturbation theory and the presence of a factor $\ln^γ(L)$ in the second-order correction is also confirmed, with the previously not known value of the exponent being $γ= 0.82(4)$. The finite-size corrections to the staggered susceptibility point to logarithmic corrections also in this quantity. To facilitate benchmarking of methods for which periodic boundary conditions are challenging, results for systems with open and cylindrical boundaries are also listed and their spatially inhomogeneous order parameters are analyzed.

TL;DR: NMR study confirms LaMnSi exhibits C-type antiferromagnetism with Mn moments along c-axis and odd-parity multipole order, showing itinerant magnetic behavior ideal for 3d electron studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate magnetic structure and electronic properties of LaMnSi as a clean 3d electron system for studying antiferromagnetism and exotic multipole order, avoiding complexities of 4f electrons in similar RTi compounds.

Method: Field-swept ⁵⁵Mn/¹³⁹La-NMR and zero-field ⁵⁵Mn-NMR (ZFNMR) spectroscopy combined with nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T₁) measurements.

Result: Confirmed Mn moments parallel to tetragonal c-axis (C-type AFM); identified odd-parity multipole order; measured internal field (19.64 T) and hyperfine coupling (A_hf=6.0 T/μB); 1/T₁ shows itinerant AFM behavior with metallic low-T response and magnon enhancement near T_N=295K.

Conclusion: LaMnSi is an ideal compound for studying 3d electron magnetism and odd-parity multipole order due to its clean electronic structure without 4f electron complications.

Abstract: We report a microscopic investigation of the magnetic structure and electronic properties of LaMnSi in its antiferromagnetic (AFM) state using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Field-swept $^{55}$Mn- and $^{139}$La-NMR spectra, as well as zero-field 55Mn-NMR (ZFNMR) spectra, reveal that the Mn ordered moments are parallel to the tetragonal c axis, consistent with the C-type AFM structure and the realization of an odd-parity multipole order. The internal field at the Mn site is determined to be 19.64 T at 4.2 K, corresponding to a hyperfine coupling constant of Ahf = 6.0 T/uB. Nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 exhibits a characteristic behavior of itinerant antiferromagnetism, showing metallic behavior at low temperatures and magnon-induced enhancement upon approaching the Neel temperature (TN = 295 K). These results show LaMnSi as an ideal compound to study 3d electron magnetism and odd-parity multipole order in the RT Si (R = rare-earth, T = transition metal) system, free of the complexities of 4f electrons.

Abstract: The ground-state phases of mixed diamond chains with ($S, τ^{(1)}, τ^{(2)})=(1/2,1/2,1)$, where $S$ is the magnitude of vertex spins, and $τ^{(1)}$ and $τ^{(2)}$ are those of apical spins, are investigated with the single-site anisotropy $D$ on the $τ^{(2)}$-site. The two apical spins in each unit cell are coupled by an exchange coupling $λ$. The vertex spins are coupled with the top and bottom apical spins by exchange couplings $1+δ$ and $1-δ$, respectively. The ground-state phase diagram is determined using the numerical exact diagonalization and DMRG method in addition to the analytical approximations in various limiting cases. The phase diagram consists of a Néel ordered phase, a nonmagnetic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase, quantized and partial ferrimagnetic phases. A region with anisotropy inversion is found where the Ising-like Néel phase is realized for the easy-plane anisotropy $D >0$ and the XY-like Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase is realized for the easy-axis anisotropy $D <0$ on the $S=1$ sites.

TL;DR: Ce₂PdSi₃ exhibits competing magnetic orders under pressure: ferromagnetic transition vanishes above 4.2 GPa while antiferromagnetic order strengthens, challenging conventional phase diagrams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frustrated Kondo lattices like Ce₂PdSi₃ are ideal for studying unconventional quantum criticality and emergent magnetic phases beyond standard theoretical frameworks.

Method: Measured magnetic properties of Ce₂PdSi₃ under varying magnetic fields and hydrostatic pressure to map phase transitions.

Result: Two magnetic transitions at ambient pressure: ferromagnetic-like at 3.8 K (T_M1) and incommensurate antiferromagnetic at 2.9 K (T_M2). Pressure suppresses T_M1 above 4.2 GPa while enhancing T_M2 stability up to 7.5 GPa.

Conclusion: Observed pressure evolution indicates competing magnetic orders not explainable by Doniach phase diagram, requiring further study of geometric frustration's role in quantum criticality.

Abstract: Frustrated Kondo lattices are ideal platforms for exploring unconventional forms of quantum criticality, as well as magnetism and other emergent phases. Here we report the magnetic properties of the candidate frustrated heavy fermion compound Ce$_2$PdSi$_3$, and map their evolution upon applying magnetic fields and hydrostatic pressure. We find that at ambient pressure Ce$_2$PdSi$_3$ exhibits two distinct magnetic phase transitions, a ferromagnetic-like transition at $T_{\mathrm{M1}}=3.8$ K and an incommensurate antiferromagnetic transition at $T_{\mathrm{M2}}=2.9$ K. Upon applying pressure, $T_{\mathrm{M1}}$ is continuously suppressed and becomes undetectable above 4.2 GPa, whereas $T_{\mathrm{M2}}$ increases and remains robust up to at least 7.5 GPa. The observed pressure evolution of magnetic order in Ce$_2$PdSi$_3$ suggests the presence of competing magnetic orders, and cannot be simply encapsulated by the Doniach phase diagram, motivating further investigations for its origin, including discerning the role of geometric frustration.

Abstract: Quantum control of the many-body wavefunction is a central challenge in quantum materials research, as it could yield a precise control knob to manipulate emergent phenomena. Floquet engineering, the coherent dressing of quantum states with periodic non-resonant optical fields, has become an important strategy for quantum control. Most applications to solid-state systems have targeted weakly interacting or single-ion states, leaving the manipulation of many-body wavefunctions largely unexplored. Here, we use Floquet engineering to achieve quantum control of a strongly correlated Hubbard exciton in the one-dimensional Mott insulator Sr$_2$CuO$_3$. A nonresonant midinfrared optical field coherently dresses the exciton wavefunction, driving its rotation between bright and dark states. We use resonant third-harmonic generation to quantify ultrafast $π/2$ rotations on the Bloch sphere spanned by these exciton states. Our work advances the quest towards programmable control of correlated states and exciton-based quantum sensing.

Abstract: Chiral spin liquid (CSL) is a magnetic analogue of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquid. Collective excitations play a vital role in shaping our understanding of these exotic quantum phases of matter and their quantum phase transitions. While the magneto-roton and long-wavelength chiral graviton modes in the FQH liquids have been extensively explored, the collective excitations of CSLs remain elusive. Here we explore the collective excitations in the SU(2) symmetric CSL phase of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1-J_2-J_χ$ model, where an intriguing quantum phase diagram was recently revealed. Combining exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle calculations, we observe two spin-singlet collective modes: a chiral p-wave (low-energy) roton mode at finite momentum and a d-wave (higher-energy) nematic mode at zero momentum, both of which are prominent across the CSL phase. Such exotic modes exhibit fingerprints distinct from those of FQH liquids, and to the best of our knowledge, are reported for the first time. By tuning $J_2$, we find the nematic mode to be pronouncedly soft, together with the spin-triplet two-spinon bound states, potentially promoting strong nematic and spin stripe instabilities. Our work paves the way for further understanding CSL from the dynamical perspective and provides new spectroscopic signatures for future experiments of CSL candidates.

TL;DR: High-quality Ce₂Sn₂O₇ crystals reveal structured diffuse neutron scattering that contradicts nearest-neighbor models but resembles classical dipolar spin ice, indicating crucial longer-range interactions in quantum spin ice materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding microscopic exchange Hamiltonian and spin correlations in Ce₂X₂O₇ quantum spin ice candidates has been hampered by poor sample quality and weak neutron signals from the small Ce³⁺ magnetic dipole moment.

Method: Hydrothermal growth of high-quality Ce₂Sn₂O₇ single crystals followed by single-crystal diffuse neutron scattering measurements.

Result: Ce₂Sn₂O₇ shows highly structured diffuse scattering along Brillouin zone boundaries, distinct from broad scattering in Ce₂Hf₂O₇ and Ce₂Zr₂O₇. The Q-dependence disagrees with nearest-neighbor XYZ model predictions but remarkably resembles classical dipolar spin ice patterns.

Conclusion: Further-neighbor interactions are critical for determining low-energy physics in Ce-pyrochlores, requiring revision of current theoretical frameworks to incorporate these effects.

Abstract: The Ce$_2$X$_2$O$_7$ (X=Sn, Hf, Zr) family of cubic pyrochlores has emerged as one of the most promising classes of Quantum Spin Ice candidates. However, understanding their microscopic exchange Hamiltonian and spin correlations has been hampered by varying sample quality, and poor signal-to-noise in the existing neutron data due to a small Ce$^{3+}$ magnetic dipole moment. In this work, we overcome these challenges and report single-crystal diffuse neutron scattering from hydrothermally grown Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ -- the highest quality crystals obtained to date for the Ce$_2$X$_2$O$_7$ family. In contrast to the broad diffuse scattering observed in Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, we find highly structured diffuse scattering from Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ featuring strong intensities along the Brillouin zone boundaries. The observed $\mathbf{Q}$-dependence disagrees with predictions of the nearest neighbour XYZ model commonly used for Ce$_2$X$_2$O$_7$, but is remarkably similar to the diffuse scattering observed in \textit{classical} Dipolar Spin Ice. Our study highlights the importance of further neighbour interactions in determining the low energy physics of the Ce-pyrochlores, and calls for a revision of the current theoretical framework to incorporate their effects.

Motivation: 探索扭曲WSe₂(tWSe₂)在费米能级靠近M点范霍夫奇点且位移场较小时，反铁磁态与超导态之间的微观竞争机制，为理解转角过渡金属硫族化合物中拓扑物态与关联效应的相互作用提供理论依据。

Result: 在2.7°和3.65°转角tWSe₂中，零位移场下主要基态候选为层间反铁磁体(AFM)、条纹自旋密度波(SDW)和铁磁Chern绝缘体(FM)；次近邻键反铁磁交换作用J₂可诱导出破缺时间反演对称性的手性超导态。

Conclusion: 莫尔超晶格中的多体相互作用可驱动tWSe₂实现拓扑超导态，为量子计算中马约拉纳零能模的调控提供了新路径，同时深化了对关联电子体系中磁性与超导性竞争关系的理解。

Abstract: The layer-dependent Hamiltonians of parallel-stacked MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayer moiré materials are topologically non-trivial, both in real space and in momentum space, and have been shown to support integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, as well as antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. Here, we address the interplay between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting states observed in tWSe$_2$ when the Fermi level is close to its $M$-point van Hove singularity and the displacement field is small. We combine DFT with path-integrals to construct a minimal moiré band model that accounts for lattice relaxation along the $c$-axis and perform Hartree-Fock calculations to identify competing charge and spin ordered states. For tWSe$_2$ at $θ=2.7^\circ$ and $θ=3.65^\circ$, we find that a layer antiferromagnet (AFM), a stripe spin-density-wave (SDW), and the ferromagnetic Chern insulator (FM) are the primary candidates for the ground state at zero displacement field, and argue that antiferromagnetic spin interactions on the next neighbor bond $J_2$ can induce a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral superconducting state.

### [70] [Gap-K%: Measuring Top-1 Prediction Gap for Detecting Pretraining Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19936)
*Minseo Kwak,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gap-K% is a novel pretraining data detection method that uses the log probability gap between top-1 predictions and target tokens with a sliding window strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance on WikiMIA and MIMIR benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of massive pretraining corpora in LLMs raises significant privacy and copyright concerns, making pretraining data detection a critical challenge. Existing methods relying on token likelihoods overlook important divergence patterns and local correlations.

Method: Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the model's top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations between adjacent tokens and mitigate token-level fluctuations.

Result: Extensive experiments on WikiMIA and MIMIR benchmarks demonstrate that Gap-K% achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming prior baselines across various model sizes and input lengths.

Conclusion: Gap-K% provides an effective solution for pretraining data detection by exploiting optimization dynamics and local token correlations, addressing privacy and copyright concerns in LLMs.

Abstract: The opacity of massive pretraining corpora in Large Language Models (LLMs) raises significant privacy and copyright concerns, making pretraining data detection a critical challenge. Existing state-of-the-art methods typically rely on token likelihoods, yet they often overlook the divergence from the model's top-1 prediction and local correlation between adjacent tokens. In this work, we propose Gap-K%, a novel pretraining data detection method grounded in the optimization dynamics of LLM pretraining. By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations. Extensive experiments on the WikiMIA and MIMIR benchmarks demonstrate that Gap-K% achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming prior baselines across various model sizes and input lengths.

### [71] [DecHW: Heterogeneous Decentralized Federated Learning Exploiting Second-Order Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19938)
*Adnan Ahmad,Chiara Boldrini,Lorenzo Valerio,Andrea Passarella,Marco Conti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel aggregation method for Decentralized Federated Learning that uses second-order information to generate consensus weights, addressing data and model heterogeneity to improve convergence and generalizability while reducing communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In Decentralized Federated Learning, data and model initialization heterogeneities across devices cause variations in local model parameters, leading to slower convergence. Existing approaches don't adequately address these parameter-level differences.

Method: The authors introduce a novel aggregation approach that captures parameter variations in local models by approximating second-order information on local datasets to generate consensus weights. These weights scale neighborhood updates before aggregating them into a global neighborhood representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on computer vision tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves strong generalizability of local models while reducing communication costs.

Conclusion: The method effectively tackles heterogeneity in DFL by addressing parameter-level variations, resulting in improved convergence and model performance with lower communication overhead.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) is a serverless collaborative machine learning paradigm where devices collaborate directly with neighbouring devices to exchange model information for learning a generalized model. However, variations in individual experiences and different levels of device interactions lead to data and model initialization heterogeneities across devices. Such heterogeneities leave variations in local model parameters across devices that leads to slower convergence. This paper tackles the data and model heterogeneity by explicitly addressing the parameter level varying evidential credence across local models. A novel aggregation approach is introduced that captures these parameter variations in local models and performs robust aggregation of neighbourhood local updates. Specifically, consensus weights are generated via approximation of second-order information of local models on their local datasets. These weights are utilized to scale neighbourhood updates before aggregating them into global neighbourhood representation. In extensive experiments with computer vision tasks, the proposed approach shows strong generalizability of local models at reduced communication costs.

TL;DR: 提出Oculomix分层采样策略，在眼科图像混合增强中引入患者级和检查级临床先验知识，显著提升心血管疾病预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像级混合增强方法(CutMix/MixUp)仅考虑图像和标签，会破坏患者特异性临床属性(共病和临床因素)，这在眼科组学预测全身性疾病时会造成信息损失

Method: 基于两个临床先验设计分层采样策略：1)检查级-同一患者同时点图像共享相同属性；2)患者级-同一患者不同时点图像具有软时间趋势。将混合空间约束在患者和检查层级，在ViT模型上验证5年MACE预测

Result: 在大型多民族人群(Alzeye)数据集上，Oculomix相比图像级CutMix和MixUp在AUROC上持续提升高达3%

Conclusion: 在眼科组学研究中，纳入患者特异性临床先验的增强方法对保持医学语义至关重要，Oculomix证明了分层混合策略在疾病预测中的必要性和价值

Abstract: Oculomics - the concept of predicting systemic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and dementia, through retinal imaging - has advanced rapidly due to the data efficiency of transformer-based foundation models like RETFound. Image-level mixed sample data augmentations, such as CutMix and MixUp, are frequently used for training transformers, yet these techniques perturb patient-specific attributes, such as medical comorbidity and clinical factors, since they only account for images and labels. To address this limitation, we propose a hierarchical sampling strategy, Oculomix, for mixed sample augmentations. Our method is based on two clinical priors. First (exam level), images acquired from the same patient at the same time point share the same attributes. Second (patient level), images acquired from the same patient at different time points have a soft temporal trend, as morbidity generally increases over time. Guided by these priors, our method constrains the mixing space to the patient and exam levels to better preserve patient-specific characteristics and leverages their hierarchical relationships. The proposed method is validated using ViT models on a five-year prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a large ethnically diverse population (Alzeye). We show that Oculomix consistently outperforms image-level CutMix and MixUp by up to 3% in AUROC, demonstrating the necessity and value of the proposed method in oculomics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全并行数据流加速器在CNN池化层和大步卷积层处理时，因输出数据量减少导致硬件单元严重闲置，利用率低下，制约了复杂CNN在FPGA上的高效实现

Method: 分析CNN数据流特性，提出数据率感知的连续流架构设计：通过交错低数据率信号、共享硬件单元，并结合合理并行化策略，动态适配不同层的数据吞吐需求

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了CNN加速中的硬件利用率瓶颈，为资源受限场景下实现高性能CNN推理提供了新思路，验证了复杂模型在单FPGA部署的可行性

Abstract: Among hardware accelerators for deep-learning inference, data flow implementations offer low latency and high throughput capabilities. In these architectures, each neuron is mapped to a dedicated hardware unit, making them well-suited for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. Previous unrolled implementations mostly focus on fully connected networks because of their simplicity, although it is well known that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require fewer computations for the same accuracy. When observing the data flow in CNNs, pooling layers and convolutional layers with a stride larger than one, the number of data at their output is reduced with respect to their input. This data reduction strongly affects the data rate in a fully parallel implementation, making hardware units heavily underutilized unless it is handled properly. This work addresses this issue by analyzing the data flow of CNNs and presents a novel approach to designing data-rate-aware, continuous-flow CNN architectures. The proposed approach ensures a high hardware utilization close to 100% by interleaving low data rate signals and sharing hardware units, as well as using the right parallelization to achieve the throughput of a fully parallel implementation. The results show that a significant amount of the arithmetic logic can be saved, which allows implementing complex CNNs like MobileNet on a single FPGA with high throughput.

*Faruk Alpay,Bugra Kilictas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper uses geometric and statistical physics methods to show that multi-step reasoning in large Transformers emerges through a sharp phase transition around 42% network depth, marked by dimensionality collapse and formation of transient object-like representations (TCOs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how complex multi-step reasoning capabilities emerge in deep Transformer language models by applying geometric and statistical-physics frameworks to uncover fundamental principles of representation formation.

Method: Treats hidden-state trajectories as flows on implicit Riemannian manifolds; analyzes layerwise covariance spectra (C^(ℓ)) and deviations from random matrix theory; formalizes forward pass as discrete coarse-graining renormalization dynamics; validates with layerwise probes on open-weight models (1.5B-30B parameters).

Result: Observed sharp effective dimensionality reduction consistent with phase transition; identified critical normalized depth γ_c ≈ 0.42 where sparsity order parameter Ω(h) shows discontinuity; discovered spectral tail collapse and formation of Transient Class Objects (TCOs); established theoretical conditions linking logical separability to spectral decay; validated predictions across multiple model families.

Conclusion: Multi-step reasoning emerges via a phase transition governed by renormalization-like dynamics, providing a unified geometric and statistical-physics framework for understanding how structured, low-entropy representations form in large language models.

Abstract: We study the emergence of multi-step reasoning in deep Transformer language models through a geometric and statistical-physics lens. Treating the hidden-state trajectory as a flow on an implicit Riemannian manifold, we analyze the layerwise covariance spectrum of activations, where $C^{(\ell)}=\mathbb{E}[h^{(\ell)}h^{(\ell)\top}]$, and track deviations from a random-matrix bulk. Across model scales (1.5B--30B), we observe a sharp reduction in effective dimensionality consistent with a phase transition: an order parameter based on sparsity/localization, $Ω(h)=1-\|h\|_1/(\sqrt{d}\|h\|_2)$, exhibits a discontinuity near a critical normalized depth $γ_c\approx 0.42$ in sufficiently large models. We formalize the forward pass as a discrete coarse-graining map and relate the appearance of stable "concept basins" to fixed points of this renormalization-like dynamics. The resulting low-entropy regime is characterized by a spectral tail collapse and by the formation of transient, reusable object-like structures in representation space, which we call Transient Class Objects (TCOs). We provide theoretical conditions connecting logical separability to spectral decay and validate the predicted signatures with layerwise probes on multiple open-weight model families.

### [75] [Emergent Specialization in Learner Populations: Competition as the Source of Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19943)
*Yuhao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Competition alone drives emergent specialization in learning populations through the NichePopulation algorithm, achieving 0.75 specialization index and outperforming MARL baselines by 4.3x across six real-world domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: How can populations of learners develop coordinated, diverse behaviors without explicit communication or diversity incentives? The paper challenges the assumption that diversity must be explicitly rewarded or communicated, proposing that competition itself can induce spontaneous specialization.

Method: The NichePopulation algorithm combines competitive exclusion with niche affinity tracking. It uses competition dynamics to create emergent specialization, where learners naturally partition into specialists for different environmental regimes based on ecological niche theory principles.

Result: Achieves mean Specialization Index of 0.75 with Cohen's d > 20 effect sizes. Key findings: (1) Emergent specialization occurs even at λ=0 (SI > 0.30); (2) Diverse populations outperform homogeneous baselines by +26.5%; (3) Outperforms MARL baselines (QMIX, MAPPO, IQL) by 4.3x while being 4x faster. Validated across six real-world domains including cryptocurrency trading, commodity prices, weather forecasting, solar irradiance, urban traffic, and air quality.

Conclusion: Competition alone is sufficient to induce emergent specialization, enabling method-level division of labor that significantly improves performance. The NichePopulation algorithm provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for achieving coordinated diversity without explicit communication or diversity incentives, demonstrating robustness across diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: How can populations of learners develop coordinated, diverse behaviors without explicit communication or diversity incentives? We demonstrate that competition alone is sufficient to induce emergent specialization -- learners spontaneously partition into specialists for different environmental regimes through competitive dynamics, consistent with ecological niche theory. We introduce the NichePopulation algorithm, a simple mechanism combining competitive exclusion with niche affinity tracking. Validated across six real-world domains (cryptocurrency trading, commodity prices, weather forecasting, solar irradiance, urban traffic, and air quality), our approach achieves a mean Specialization Index of 0.75 with effect sizes of Cohen's d > 20. Key findings: (1) At lambda=0 (no niche bonus), learners still achieve SI > 0.30, proving specialization is genuinely emergent; (2) Diverse populations outperform homogeneous baselines by +26.5% through method-level division of labor; (3) Our approach outperforms MARL baselines (QMIX, MAPPO, IQL) by 4.3x while being 4x faster.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper theoretically links loss landscape flatness with label noise, showing simulated noise can improve generalization. They propose NCSAM that uses SAM's perturbations to compensate for label noise damage, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on noisy datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often contain erroneous annotations (e.g., from web crawling), posing a fundamental challenge for deep learning. Current research focuses on label correction mechanisms, but lacks theoretical understanding of how loss landscape properties relate to label noise.

Method: Proposes Noise-Compensated Sharpness-aware Minimization (NCSAM), which leverages the perturbation mechanism of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to remedy label noise damage, using carefully simulated label noise to enhance robustness.

Result: Theoretical analysis reveals simulated label noise synergistically improves generalization and robustness. Testing accuracy exhibits behavior similar to noise-clear datasets. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show consistent superiority over existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The method provides a theoretically-grounded solution to noisy label challenges by connecting loss landscape flatness with robustness, demonstrating that leveraging SAM's perturbations can effectively compensate for label noise damage.

Abstract: Learning from Noisy Labels (LNL) presents a fundamental challenge in deep learning, as real-world datasets often contain erroneous or corrupted annotations, \textit{e.g.}, data crawled from Web. Current research focuses on sophisticated label correction mechanisms. In contrast, this paper adopts a novel perspective by establishing a theoretical analysis the relationship between flatness of the loss landscape and the presence of label noise. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that carefully simulated label noise synergistically enhances both the generalization performance and robustness of label noises. Consequently, we propose Noise-Compensated Sharpness-aware Minimization (NCSAM) to leverage the perturbation of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to remedy the damage of label noises. Our analysis reveals that the testing accuracy exhibits a similar behavior that has been observed on the noise-clear dataset. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art approaches on diverse tasks.

Conclusion: 该范式突破亚采样率响应限制，实现实时智能采样决策，为高能效传感系统提供新方案。

Abstract: Extending the intelligence of sensors to the data-acquisition process - deciding whether to sample or not - can result in transformative energy-efficiency gains. However, making such a decision in a deterministic manner involves risk of losing information. Here we present a sensing paradigm that enables making such a decision in a probabilistic manner. The paradigm takes inspiration from the autonomous nervous system and employs a probabilistic neuron (p-neuron) driven by an analog feature extraction circuit. The response time of the system is on the order of microseconds, over-coming the sub-sampling-rate response time limit and enabling real-time intelligent autonomous activation of data-sampling. Validation experiments on active seismic survey data demonstrate lossless probabilistic data acquisition, with a normalized mean squared error of 0.41%, and 93% saving in the active operation time of the system and the number of generated samples.

TL;DR: MeanCache is a training-free caching framework for Flow Matching inference that uses average-velocity perspective and cached Jacobian-vector products to mitigate error accumulation, achieving 3.5-4.5x speedup on large generative models like FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo.

Motivation: Existing caching methods for Flow Matching rely on instantaneous velocity information, causing severe trajectory deviations and error accumulation under high acceleration ratios.

Method: Introduces an average-velocity perspective using cached Jacobian-vector products (JVP) to construct interval average velocities, plus a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy with Peak-Suppressed Shortest Path under budget constraints.

Result: Achieves 4.12X, 4.56X, and 3.59X acceleration on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo respectively while outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in generation quality.

Conclusion: This simple yet effective approach provides a new perspective for Flow Matching inference and will inspire further exploration of stability-driven acceleration in commercial-scale generative models.

Abstract: We present MeanCache, a training-free caching framework for efficient Flow Matching inference. Existing caching methods reduce redundant computation but typically rely on instantaneous velocity information (e.g., feature caching), which often leads to severe trajectory deviations and error accumulation under high acceleration ratios. MeanCache introduces an average-velocity perspective: by leveraging cached Jacobian--vector products (JVP) to construct interval average velocities from instantaneous velocities, it effectively mitigates local error accumulation. To further improve cache timing and JVP reuse stability, we develop a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy as a practical tool, employing a Peak-Suppressed Shortest Path under budget constraints to determine the schedule. Experiments on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that MeanCache achieves 4.12X and 4.56X and 3.59X acceleration, respectively, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art caching baselines in generation quality. We believe this simple yet effective approach provides a new perspective for Flow Matching inference and will inspire further exploration of stability-driven acceleration in commercial-scale generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 侵入式脑机接口中，由于神经活动的跨会话非平稳性，在一个会话上训练的解码器往往无法泛化到后续会话。当新会话数据有限时，重新训练或适应解码器变得尤为困难。

Method: 提出任务条件潜在对齐框架TCLA。基于自动编码器架构，首先从数据充足的源会话学习神经动力学的低维表示；然后对数据有限的目标会话，以任务条件化的方式对齐目标潜在表示到源空间，实现有效迁移。

Result: 在猕猴运动和眼动中心向外数据集上评估，TCLA在不同数据集和解码设置下均持续优于仅使用目标会话数据训练的基线方法，在运动数据集的y坐标速度解码上决定系数提升高达0.386。

Conclusion: TCLA提供了一种从源会话向目标会话迁移知识的有效策略，能够在数据有限的条件下实现更鲁棒的神经解码。

Abstract: Cross-session nonstationarity in neural activity recorded by implanted electrodes is a major challenge for invasive Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), as decoders trained on data from one session often fail to generalize to subsequent sessions. This issue is further exacerbated in practice, as retraining or adapting decoders becomes particularly challenging when only limited data are available from a new session. To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data.

Conclusion: NetCVR需在线持续建模；级联建模优于直接预测；延迟时间是关键特征；开源数据集和框架推动该领域研究进展

Abstract: In industrial recommender systems, conversion rate (CVR) is widely used for traffic allocation, but it fails to fully reflect recommendation effectiveness because it ignores refund behavior. To better capture true user satisfaction and business value, net conversion rate (NetCVR), defined as the probability that a clicked item is purchased and not refunded, has been proposed.Unlike CVR, NetCVR prediction involves a more complex multi-stage cascaded delayed feedback process. The two cascaded delays from click to conversion and from conversion to refund have opposite effects, making traditional CVR modeling methods inapplicable. Moreover, the lack of open-source datasets and online continuous training schemes further hinders progress in this area.To address these challenges, we introduce CASCADE (Cascaded Sequences of Conversion and Delayed Refund), the first large-scale open dataset derived from the Taobao app for online continuous NetCVR prediction. Through an in-depth analysis of CASCADE, we identify three key insights: (1) NetCVR exhibits strong temporal dynamics, necessitating online continuous modeling; (2) cascaded modeling of CVR and refund rate outperforms direct NetCVR modeling; and (3) delay time, which correlates with both CVR and refund rate, is an important feature for NetCVR prediction.Based on these insights, we propose TESLA, a continuous NetCVR modeling framework featuring a CVR-refund-rate cascaded architecture, stage-wise debiasing, and a delay-time-aware ranking loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TESLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CASCADE, achieving absolute improvements of 12.41 percent in RI-AUC and 14.94 percent in RI-PRAUC on NetCVR prediction. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/alimama-tech/NetCVR.

Abstract: Industrial image anomaly detection is a challenging problem owing to extreme class imbalance and the scarcity of labeled defective samples, particularly in few-shot settings. We propose BayPrAnoMeta, a Bayesian generalization of Proto-MAML for few-shot industrial image anomaly detection. Unlike existing Proto-MAML approaches that rely on deterministic class prototypes and distance-based adaptation, BayPrAnoMeta replaces prototypes with task-specific probabilistic normality models and performs inner-loop adaptation via a Bayesian posterior predictive likelihood. We model normal support embeddings with a Normal-Inverse-Wishart (NIW) prior, producing a Student-$t$ predictive distribution that enables uncertainty-aware, heavy-tailed anomaly scoring and is essential for robustness in extreme few-shot settings. We further extend BayPrAnoMeta to a federated meta-learning framework with supervised contrastive regularization for heterogeneous industrial clients and prove convergence to stationary points of the resulting nonconvex objective. Experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark demonstrate consistent and significant AUROC improvements over MAML, Proto-MAML, and PatchCore-based methods in few-shot anomaly detection settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved sparse autoencoder method using cross-modal masking and group-sparsity to learn multimodal-aligned features, addressing the problem that standard SAEs learn unimodal "split dictionaries" in multimodal embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse autoencoders applied to multimodal embeddings (e.g., CLIP) often learn split dictionaries where features are unimodal rather than multimodal, failing to capture shared semantic concepts across modalities.

Method: The authors propose a new SAE approach with cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization, theoretically showing that split dictionaries imply existence of better non-split dictionaries.

Result: Applied to CLIP and CLAP embeddings, their method learns more multimodal dictionaries, reduces dead neurons, and improves feature semanticity compared to standard SAEs.

Conclusion: The improved cross-modal concept alignment enables better interpretability and control for cross-modal tasks.

Abstract: The Linear Representation Hypothesis asserts that the embeddings learned by neural networks can be understood as linear combinations of features corresponding to high-level concepts. Based on this ansatz, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become a popular method for decomposing embeddings into a sparse combination of linear directions, which have been shown empirically to often correspond to human-interpretable semantics. However, recent attempts to apply SAEs to multimodal embedding spaces (such as the popular CLIP embeddings for image/text data) have found that SAEs often learn "split dictionaries", where most of the learned sparse features are essentially unimodal, active only for data of a single modality. In this work, we study how to effectively adapt SAEs for the setting of multimodal embeddings while ensuring multimodal alignment. We first argue that the existence of a split dictionary decomposition on an aligned embedding space implies the existence of a non-split dictionary with improved modality alignment. Then, we propose a new SAE-based approach to multimodal embedding decomposition using cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization. We apply our method to popular embeddings for image/text (CLIP) and audio/text (CLAP) data and show that, compared to standard SAEs, our approach learns a more multimodal dictionary while reducing the number of dead neurons and improving feature semanticity. We finally demonstrate how this improvement in alignment of concepts between modalities can enable improvements in the interpretability and control of cross-modal tasks.

### [83] [Structural Compositional Function Networks: Interpretable Functional Compositions for Tabular Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20037)
*Fang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes StructuralCFN, a novel neural network for tabular data that models feature relationships via differentiable structural priors, achieving better performance than traditional deep learning while being 10-20x smaller and providing human-interpretable mathematical expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning underperforms on tabular data compared to gradient-boosted trees, especially in high-stakes domains, because standard neural networks treat features as independent and lack scientific interpretability.

Method: Developed Structural Compositional Function Networks (StructuralCFN) that imposes Relation-Aware Inductive Bias via a differentiable structural prior, modeling each feature as a mathematical composition of others using Differentiable Adaptive Gating to discover optimal activation functions.

Result: On 18 benchmarks with 10-fold cross-validation, StructuralCFN achieved statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) on scientific/clinical datasets, provides intrinsic symbolic interpretability through human-readable mathematical expressions, and uses only 300-2,500 parameters (10-20x smaller than standard deep baselines).

Conclusion: StructuralCFN successfully bridges the performance gap between deep learning and gradient-boosted trees for tabular data while offering both scientific interpretability and computational efficiency, making it suitable for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of tabular data in high-stakes domains, traditional deep learning architectures often struggle to match the performance of gradient-boosted decision trees while maintaining scientific interpretability. Standard neural networks typically treat features as independent entities, failing to exploit the inherent manifold structural dependencies that define tabular distributions. We propose Structural Compositional Function Networks (StructuralCFN), a novel architecture that imposes a Relation-Aware Inductive Bias via a differentiable structural prior. StructuralCFN explicitly models each feature as a mathematical composition of its counterparts through Differentiable Adaptive Gating, which automatically discovers the optimal activation physics (e.g., attention-style filtering vs. inhibitory polarity) for each relationship. Our framework enables Structured Knowledge Integration, allowing domain-specific relational priors to be injected directly into the architecture to guide discovery. We evaluate StructuralCFN across a rigorous 10-fold cross-validation suite on 18 benchmarks, demonstrating statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) on scientific and clinical datasets (e.g., Blood Transfusion, Ozone, WDBC). Furthermore, StructuralCFN provides Intrinsic Symbolic Interpretability: it recovers the governing "laws" of the data manifold as human-readable mathematical expressions while maintaining a compact parameter footprint (300--2,500 parameters) that is over an order of magnitude (10x--20x) smaller than standard deep baselines.

Conclusion: TONEL框架有效解决了边缘设备RAG的噪声鲁棒性和领域适应性挑战，为动态环境中的个性化虚拟助手提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Personalized virtual assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) on edge devices are attracting growing attention, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a key method for personalization by retrieving relevant profile data and generating tailored responses. However, deploying RAG on edge devices faces efficiency hurdles due to the rapid growth of profile data, such as user-LLM interactions and recent updates. While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments. TONEL employs a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware constraints, enabling accurate retrieval under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on personalization benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our methods relative to strong baselines, especially in task-specific noisy scenarios.

*Yan Zhang,Xuefeng Liu,Sipeng Chen,Sascha Ranftl,Chong Liu,Shibo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Standard Bayesian Optimization fails on multi-regime problems due to uniform smoothness assumption. RAMBO uses a Dirichlet Process Mixture of GPs with collapsed Gibbs sampling and adaptive scheduling to automatically discover latent regimes, decomposing uncertainty for better optimization on synthetic and real-world molecular/fusion design tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard BO assumes uniform smoothness across the search space, but real-world problems like molecular conformation search and drug discovery have multiple distinct regimes (e.g., energy basins, molecular scaffolds). A single GP model cannot capture both sharp transitions between regimes and smoothness within regimes, leading to miscalibrated uncertainty estimates and poor optimization performance.

Method: The paper proposes RAMBO, a Dirichlet Process Mixture of Gaussian Processes that: 1) automatically discovers latent regimes during optimization, 2) models each regime with an independent GP having locally-optimized hyperparameters, 3) uses collapsed Gibbs sampling to analytically marginalize latent functions for efficient inference, 4) implements adaptive concentration parameter scheduling for coarse-to-fine regime discovery, and 5) develops acquisition functions that decompose uncertainty into intra-regime and inter-regime components.

Result: Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and three real-world applications (molecular conformer optimization, virtual screening for drug discovery, and fusion reactor design) show that RAMBO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multi-regime objectives.

Conclusion: RAMBO successfully addresses the multi-regime optimization problem by automatically discovering latent regimes with specialized GP models, providing better uncertainty quantification and acquisition functions, leading to significant performance improvements across diverse practical applications.

Abstract: Standard Bayesian Optimization (BO) assumes uniform smoothness across the search space an assumption violated in multi-regime problems such as molecular conformation search through distinct energy basins or drug discovery across heterogeneous molecular scaffolds. A single GP either oversmooths sharp transitions or hallucinates noise in smooth regions, yielding miscalibrated uncertainty. We propose RAMBO, a Dirichlet Process Mixture of Gaussian Processes that automatically discovers latent regimes during optimization, each modeled by an independent GP with locally-optimized hyperparameters. We derive collapsed Gibbs sampling that analytically marginalizes latent functions for efficient inference, and introduce adaptive concentration parameter scheduling for coarse-to-fine regime discovery. Our acquisition functions decompose uncertainty into intra-regime and inter-regime components. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, including molecular conformer optimization, virtual screening for drug discovery, and fusion reactor design, demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on multi-regime objectives.

TL;DR: 开发了基于纵向临床数据的180天死亡风险预测模型，GRU模型在外部验证中表现最佳（PR-AUC=0.87），为转移性去势抵抗性前列腺癌患者提供多个月 proactive 护理窗口


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 转移性去势抵抗性前列腺癌(mCRPC)恶性程度高、预后差且治疗反应异质性大，需精准预测短期死亡风险以优化临床决策

Method: 利用两个III期临床试验的纵向数据(n=526/640)，仅纳入可观测180天结局的就诊记录；对比LSTM/GRU/Cox/随机生存森林/逻辑回归五种模型，以85%灵敏度为阈值筛选标准

Result: GRU模型外部验证表现最优：校准斜率0.93/截距0.07，PR-AUC达0.87；真阳性预警中位时间151天(假阳性59天)，每100次就诊触发18.3次警报；BMI和收缩压是核心预测因子

Conclusion: 常规纵向临床指标可有效预测mCRPC患者数月内死亡风险，支持临床开展前瞻性护理规划，GRU模型具备临床转化价值

Abstract: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a highly aggressive disease with poor prognosis and heterogeneous treatment response. In this work, we developed and externally validated a visit-level 180-day mortality risk model using longitudinal data from two Phase III cohorts (n=526 and n=640). Only visits with observable 180-day outcomes were labeled; right-censored cases were excluded from analysis. We compared five candidate architectures: Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forest (RSF), and Logistic Regression. For each dataset, we selected the smallest risk-threshold that achieved an 85% sensitivity floor. The GRU and RSF models showed high discrimination capabilities initially (C-index: 87% for both). In external validation, the GRU obtained a higher calibration (slope: 0.93; intercept: 0.07) and achieved an PR-AUC of 0.87. Clinical impact analysis showed a median time-in-warning of 151.0 days for true positives (59.0 days for false positives) and 18.3 alerts per 100 patient-visits. Given late-stage frailty or cachexia and hemodynamic instability, permutation importance ranked BMI and systolic blood pressure as the strongest associations. These results suggest that longitudinal routine clinical markers can estimate short-horizon mortality risk in mCRPC and support proactive care planning over a multi-month window.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标训练中梯度冲突导致潜在表示崩溃，使共享表示陷入对单个任务次优的妥协状态。

Method: Domain Expansion框架采用正交池化机制，为每个目标分配相互正交的子空间以重构潜在空间。

Result: 在ShapeNet、MPIIGaze和Rotated MNIST等基准测试中验证成功，不仅防止表示崩溃，还生成可解释、可组合且可直接操作的潜在空间。

Conclusion: 正交子空间结构有效解决多目标训练中的表示崩溃问题，同时产生具有可解释性的潜在表示。

Abstract: Training a single network with multiple objectives often leads to conflicting gradients that degrade shared representations, forcing them into a compromised state that is suboptimal for any single task--a problem we term latent representation collapse. We introduce Domain Expansion, a framework that prevents these conflicts by restructuring the latent space itself. Our framework uses a novel orthogonal pooling mechanism to construct a latent space where each objective is assigned to a mutually orthogonal subspace. We validate our approach across diverse benchmarks--including ShapeNet, MPIIGaze, and Rotated MNIST--on challenging multi-objective problems combining classification with pose and gaze estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that this structure not only prevents collapse but also yields an explicit, interpretable, and compositional latent space where concepts can be directly manipulated.

Conclusion: QAD是恢复量化模型精度的有效且实用的最佳实践，特别适用于传统QAT难以处理的多阶段训练场景，为NVFP4量化模型提供了可靠的精度恢复方案

Abstract: This technical report presents quantization-aware distillation (QAD) and our best practices for recovering accuracy of NVFP4-quantized large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). QAD distills a full-precision teacher model into a quantized student model using a KL divergence loss. While applying distillation to quantized models is not a new idea, we observe key advantages of QAD for today's LLMs: 1. It shows remarkable effectiveness and stability for models trained through multi-stage post-training pipelines, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and model merging, where traditional quantization-aware training (QAT) suffers from engineering complexity and training instability; 2. It is robust to data quality and coverage, enabling accuracy recovery without full training data. We evaluate QAD across multiple post-trained models including AceReason Nemotron, Nemotron 3 Nano, Nemotron Nano V2, Nemotron Nano V2 VL (VLM), and Llama Nemotron Super v1, showing consistent recovery to near-BF16 accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Decision Importance Transformer (DIT) for in-context reinforcement learning from suboptimal offline data. Uses a transformer value function to estimate advantages and weights policy training via weighted MLE, outperforming standard methods on bandit and MDP problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel at in-context learning, but standard autoregressive training on suboptimal offline RL trajectories leads to imitation learning and poor performance. Need a method to learn optimal policies from suboptimal data in-context.

Method: Proposes DIT framework that emulates actor-critic: 1) Train transformer value function to estimate behavior policy advantages; 2) Train transformer policy via weighted MLE using value-based weights to steer toward optimal policies.

Result: DIT achieves superior performance on bandit and Markov Decision Process problems, especially when offline datasets contain suboptimal historical trajectories.

Conclusion: DIT successfully addresses suboptimal data challenge in in-context RL by leveraging transformer-based value estimation for importance weighting, demonstrating effective off-policy learning from imperfect demonstrations.

Abstract: Transformer models have achieved remarkable empirical successes, largely due to their in-context learning capabilities. Inspired by this, we explore training an autoregressive transformer for in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). In this setting, we initially train a transformer on an offline dataset consisting of trajectories collected from various RL tasks, and then fix and use this transformer to create an action policy for new RL tasks. Notably, we consider the setting where the offline dataset contains trajectories sampled from suboptimal behavioral policies. In this case, standard autoregressive training corresponds to imitation learning and results in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Decision Importance Transformer(DIT) framework, which emulates the actor-critic algorithm in an in-context manner. In particular, we first train a transformer-based value function that estimates the advantage functions of the behavior policies that collected the suboptimal trajectories. Then we train a transformer-based policy via a weighted maximum likelihood estimation loss, where the weights are constructed based on the trained value function to steer the suboptimal policies to the optimal ones. We conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of DIT on both bandit and Markov Decision Process problems. Our results show that DIT achieves superior performance, particularly when the offline dataset contains suboptimal historical data.

Conclusion: The proposed reinforcement learning framework is effective for large-scale Polar code design, with the three highlighted elements being crucial for enabling efficient learning at scale, making it suitable for 6G standardization.

Abstract: To advance Polar code design for 6G applications, we develop a reinforcement learning-based universal sequence design framework that is extensible and adaptable to diverse channel conditions and decoding strategies. Crucially, our method scales to code lengths up to $2048$, making it suitable for use in standardization.

Conclusion: 检测到的问题将在未来的工作中得到解决。

Abstract: Since its introduction, Facebook Prophet has attracted positive attention from both classical statisticians and the Bayesian statistics community. The model provides two built-in inference methods: maximum a posteriori estimation using the L-BFGS-B algorithm, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling via the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). While exploring various time-series forecasting problems using Bayesian inference with Prophet, we encountered limitations stemming from the inability to apply alternative inference techniques beyond those provided by default. Additionally, the fluent API design of Facebook Prophet proved insufficiently flexible for implementing our custom modeling ideas. To address these shortcomings, we developed a complete reimplementation of the Prophet model in PyMC, which enables us to extend the base model and evaluate and compare multiple Bayesian inference methods. In this paper, we present our PyMC-based implementation and analyze in detail the implementation of different Bayesian inference techniques. We consider full MCMC techniques, MAP estimation and Variational inference techniques on a time-series forecasting problem. We discuss in details the sampling approach, convergence diagnostics, forecasting metrics as well as their computational efficiency and detect possible issues which will be addressed in our future work.

TL;DR: This paper systematically investigates Membership Inference Attack vulnerabilities in Diffusion Language Models for the first time, proposing SAMA method that exploits DLMs' multiple maskable configurations to achieve 30% AUC improvement over baselines, revealing critical privacy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are promising but their privacy leakage via Membership Inference Attacks remains critically underexplored, especially given their unique bidirectional masked token prediction architecture that differs from autoregressive models.

Method: The authors propose SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which samples masked subsets across progressive densities, uses sign-based statistics to handle heavy-tailed noise, and employs inverse-weighted aggregation to prioritize cleaner signals from sparse masks, transforming sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism.

Result: Experiments on nine datasets demonstrate SAMA achieves 30% relative AUC improvement over the best baseline, with up to 8 times improvement at low false positive rates.

Conclusion: The findings reveal significant, previously unknown vulnerabilities in DLMs, highlighting the urgent need for developing tailored privacy defense mechanisms for these models.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) represent a promising alternative to autoregressive language models, using bidirectional masked token prediction. Yet their susceptibility to privacy leakage via Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) remains critically underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic investigation of MIA vulnerabilities in DLMs. Unlike the autoregressive models' single fixed prediction pattern, DLMs' multiple maskable configurations exponentially increase attack opportunities. This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism. Experiments on nine datasets show SAMA achieves 30% relative AUC improvement over the best baseline, with up to 8 times improvement at low false positive rates. These findings reveal significant, previously unknown vulnerabilities in DLMs, necessitating the development of tailored privacy defenses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scale next-token prediction to long context for source-space MEG data across multiple datasets and scanners, handling over 500 hours of recordings to enable long-horizon brain activity generation.

Method: Uses a modified SEANet-style vector-quantizer to compress multichannel MEG into a flattened token stream, then trains a Qwen2.5-VL backbone from scratch for next-token prediction and recursive generation. Evaluates with on-manifold stability tests and conditional specificity metrics using prompt-swap controls.

Result: Generations remain relatively stable over long rollouts and are closer to correct continuations than swapped controls. Demonstrates cross-dataset generalization when trained on CamCAN and Omega and tested on held-out MOUS.

Conclusion: The model successfully scales to long-context MEG generation while maintaining stability and conditional specificity, showing strong cross-dataset generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We present a large autoregressive model for source-space MEG that scales next-token prediction to long context across datasets and scanners: handling a corpus of over 500 hours and thousands of sessions across the three largest MEG datasets. A modified SEANet-style vector-quantizer reduces multichannel MEG into a flattened token stream on which we train a Qwen2.5-VL backbone from scratch to predict the next brain token and to recursively generate minutes of MEG from up to a minute of context. To evaluate long-horizon generation, we introduce three task-matched tests: (i) on-manifold stability via generated-only drift compared to the time-resolved distribution of real sliding windows, and (ii) conditional specificity via correct context versus prompt-swap controls using a neurophysiologically grounded metric set. We train on CamCAN and Omega and run all analyses on held-out MOUS, establishing cross-dataset generalization. Across metrics, generations remain relatively stable over long rollouts and are closer to the correct continuation than swapped controls. Code available at: https://github.com/ricsinaruto/brain-gen.

Result: 建立了SSL的理论基础框架，解释了现有成功算法的核心机制，并启发了更高效的实际算法开发

Conclusion: 通过谱表示理论实现了SSL领域的统一理解，为未来算法设计和应用提供了原则性指导方向

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) have improved empirical performance by unleashing the power of unlabeled data for practical applications. Specifically, SSL extracts the representation from massive unlabeled data, which will be transferred to a plenty of down streaming tasks with limited data. The significant improvement on diverse applications of representation learning has attracted increasing attention, resulting in a variety of dramatically different self-supervised learning objectives for representation extraction, with an assortment of learning procedures, but the lack of a clear and unified understanding. Such an absence hampers the ongoing development of representation learning, leaving a theoretical understanding missing, principles for efficient algorithm design unclear, and the use of representation learning methods in practice unjustified. The urgency for a unified framework is further motivated by the rapid growth in representation learning methods. In this paper, we are therefore compelled to develop a principled foundation of representation learning. We first theoretically investigate the sufficiency of the representation from a spectral representation view, which reveals the spectral essence of the existing successful SSL algorithms and paves the path to a unified framework for understanding and analysis. Such a framework work also inspires the development of more efficient and easy-to-use representation learning algorithms with principled way in real-world applications.

*Pedro Chumpitaz-Flores,My Duong,Ying Mao,Kaixun Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PASS is a scalable pairwise-constrained clustering framework that collapses must-link constraints into pseudo-points and uses two selection rules (margin-based and information-geometric) to achieve competitive clustering quality at lower computational cost than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pairwise-constrained clustering methods struggle with data scalability due to the complexity added by must-link and cannot-link constraints, especially in niche applications like quantum or quantum-hybrid clustering where traditional approaches fail to scale efficiently.

Method: The PASS framework handles must-link constraints by collapsing them into pseudo-points, then employs two subset selection strategies: a constraint-aware margin rule that selects near-boundary points and cannot-link violations, and an information-geometric rule that scores points using Fisher-Rao distance from soft assignment posteriors to select the highest-information subset under a budget.

Result: Across diverse benchmarks, PASS achieves competitive sum of squared errors (SSE) at substantially lower computational cost than exact or penalty-based methods, while remaining effective in problem regimes where prior approaches fail.

Conclusion: PASS successfully enables scalable, high-quality pairwise-constrained clustering by preserving constraint satisfaction through intelligent subset selection, making it suitable for large-scale and specialized applications where existing methods are computationally prohibitive.

Abstract: Pairwise-constrained clustering augments unsupervised partitioning with side information by enforcing must-link (ML) and cannot-link (CL) constraints between specific samples, yielding labelings that respect known affinities and separations. However, ML and CL constraints add an extra layer of complexity to the clustering problem, with current methods struggling in data scalability, especially in niche applications like quantum or quantum-hybrid clustering. We propose PASS, a pairwise-constraints and ambiguity-driven subset selection framework that preserves ML and CL constraints satisfaction while allowing scalable, high-quality clustering solution. PASS collapses ML constraints into pseudo-points and offers two selectors: a constraint-aware margin rule that collects near-boundary points and all detected CL violations, and an information-geometric rule that scores points via a Fisher-Rao distance derived from soft assignment posteriors, then selects the highest-information subset under a simple budget. Across diverse benchmarks, PASS attains competitive SSE at substantially lower cost than exact or penalty-based methods, and remains effective in regimes where prior approaches fail.

Motivation: Prior work qualitatively showed language models exhibit implicit planning behavior despite next-token prediction training, but methods were complex. Understanding planning abilities is important for AI safety and control.

Method: Uses simple vector steering at the end of preceding lines to manipulate generation, tested on rhyme poetry generation and question answering tasks, scaling across many model sizes.

Result: Vector steering successfully manipulates rhymes/answers and affects intermediate tokens; implicit planning is universal and exists in models as small as 1B parameters.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a widely applicable, direct way to study LLM implicit planning abilities, with implications for AI safety and control.

Abstract: Prior work suggests that language models, while trained on next token prediction, show implicit planning behavior: they may select the next token in preparation to a predicted future token, such as a likely rhyming word, as supported by a prior qualitative study of Claude 3.5 Haiku using a cross-layer transcoder. We propose much simpler techniques for assessing implicit planning in language models. With case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering, we demonstrate that our methodology easily scales to many models. Across models, we find that the generated rhyme (e.g. "-ight") or answer to a question ("whale") can be manipulated by steering at the end of the preceding line with a vector, affecting the generation of intermediate tokens leading up to the rhyme or answer word. We show that implicit planning is a universal mechanism, present in smaller models than previously thought, starting from 1B parameters. Our methodology offers a widely applicable direct way to study implicit planning abilities of LLMs. More broadly, understanding planning abilities of language models can inform decisions in AI safety and control.

Conclusion: 理论证明SSVM局部解优于hSVM/rSVM，实数实验验证了基于局部解的SSVM在真实数据集上的潜在优势，完善了稀疏SVM的理论基础。

Abstract: Due to the rise of cardinality minimization in optimization, sparse support vector machines (SSVMs) have attracted much attention lately and show certain empirical advantages over convex SVMs. A common way to derive an SSVM is to add a cardinality function such as $\ell_0$-norm to the dual problem of a convex SVM. However, this process lacks theoretical justification. This paper fills the gap by developing a local duality theory for such an SSVM formulation and exploring its relationship with the hinge-loss SVM (hSVM) and the ramp-loss SVM (rSVM). In particular, we prove that the derived SSVM is exactly the dual problem of the 0/1-loss SVM, and the linear representer theorem holds for their local solutions. The local solution of SSVM also provides guidelines on selecting hyperparameters of hSVM and rSVM. {Under specific conditions, we show that a sequence of global solutions of hSVM converges to a local solution of 0/1-loss SVM. Moreover, a local minimizer of 0/1-loss SVM is a local minimizer of rSVM.} This explains why a local solution induced by SSVM outperforms hSVM and rSVM in the prior empirical study. We further conduct numerical tests on real datasets and demonstrate potential advantages of SSVM by working with locally nice solutions proposed in this paper.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new diagnostic method that measures how neural emulators of PDEs internalize physical symmetries by analyzing gradient overlaps along group orbits, revealing how learning dynamics couple equivalent configurations and enabling evaluation of whether models have truly learned symmetry properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forward-pass equivariance tests are insufficient for understanding how neural emulators internalize physical symmetries; there's a need to assess whether learning dynamics actually couple physically equivalent configurations during training.

Method: An influence-based diagnostic that measures the propagation of parameter updates between symmetry-related states, defined as the metric-weighted overlap of loss gradients evaluated along group orbits, probing the local geometry of the learned loss landscape.

Result: Applied to autoregressive fluid flow emulators, orbit-wise gradient coherence provides the mechanism for learning to generalize over symmetry transformations and indicates when training selects a symmetry compatible basin.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel technique for evaluating whether surrogate models have internalized the symmetry properties of the known solution operator, going beyond simple forward-pass tests.

Abstract: We study how neural emulators of partial differential equation solution operators internalize physical symmetries by introducing an influence-based diagnostic that measures the propagation of parameter updates between symmetry-related states, defined as the metric-weighted overlap of loss gradients evaluated along group orbits. This quantity probes the local geometry of the learned loss landscape and goes beyond forward-pass equivariance tests by directly assessing whether learning dynamics couple physically equivalent configurations. Applying our diagnostic to autoregressive fluid flow emulators, we show that orbit-wise gradient coherence provides the mechanism for learning to generalize over symmetry transformations and indicates when training selects a symmetry compatible basin. The result is a novel technique for evaluating if surrogate models have internalized symmetry properties of the known solution operator.

TL;DR: MAPLE is a novel nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that improves UMAP through self-supervised learning and maximum manifold capacity representations (MMCRs) for clearer cluster separation in complex high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMAP struggles with high-dimensional data exhibiting significant intra-cluster variance and curved manifold structures (e.g., biological/image data), leading to suboptimal cluster visualization.

Method: Employs self-supervised learning with maximum manifold capacity representations (MMCRs) to compress variance among similar local points while amplifying variance among dissimilar points, enhancing low-dimensional manifold geometry encoding.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show MAPLE achieves clearer visual cluster separations and finer subcluster resolution than UMAP, while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MAPLE effectively addresses UMAP's limitations for complex manifold structures, particularly in biological and image data, by leveraging MMCRs for superior dimensionality reduction without increased computational cost.

Abstract: We present a new nonlinear dimensionality reduction method, MAPLE, that enhances UMAP by improving manifold modeling. MAPLE employs a self-supervised learning approach to more efficiently encode low-dimensional manifold geometry. Central to this approach are maximum manifold capacity representations (MMCRs), which help untangle complex manifolds by compressing variances among locally similar data points while amplifying variance among dissimilar data points. This design is particularly effective for high-dimensional data with substantial intra-cluster variance and curved manifold structures, such as biological or image data. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MAPLE can produce clearer visual cluster separations and finer subcluster resolution than UMAP while maintaining comparable computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes NeuraLSP, a novel neural preconditioner using left singular subspace of near-nullspace vectors to compress spectral information into fixed low-rank operator, solving rank inflation in GNN-based PDE solvers with 53% speedup and theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural preconditioners for PDEs suffer from rank inflation and suboptimal convergence when converting sparse linear systems to graphs, limiting their effectiveness in accelerating PDE solutions.

Method: Introduces NeuraLSP which leverages the left singular subspace of the system matrix's near-nullspace vectors to create a fixed low-rank operator that compresses spectral information, combined with a novel loss metric targeting this subspace.

Result: Achieves up to 53% speedup in convergence, demonstrates empirical robustness to rank inflation, and shows strong performance across diverse PDE families with theoretical guarantees for the new loss function.

Conclusion: NeuraLSP provides a theoretically grounded and empirically validated neural preconditioner that overcomes key limitations of prior graph-based methods, significantly accelerating PDE solutions while maintaining robustness.

Abstract: Numerical techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) are integral for many fields across science and engineering. Such techniques usually involve solving large, sparse linear systems, where preconditioning methods are critical. In recent years, neural methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have demonstrated their potential through accelerated convergence. Nonetheless, to extract connective structures, existing techniques aggregate discretized system matrices into graphs, and suffer from rank inflation and a suboptimal convergence rate. In this paper, we articulate NeuraLSP, a novel neural preconditioner combined with a novel loss metric that leverages the left singular subspace of the system matrix's near-nullspace vectors. By compressing spectral information into a fixed low-rank operator, our method exhibits both theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness to rank inflation, affording up to a 53% speedup. Besides the theoretical guarantees for our newly-formulated loss function, our comprehensive experimental results across diverse families of PDEs also substantiate the aforementioned theoretical advances.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a causal evaluation framework for OOD generalization that measures representation necessity and sufficiency rather than just invariance, showing improved performance on multi-domain benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD generalization methods rely on domain-invariant representations but invariance doesn't guarantee causal effectiveness for prediction; there's a need to evaluate features based on their necessity and sufficiency under distribution shift.

Method: Introduces an explicit segment-level framework that directly measures causal effectiveness across domains by evaluating learned representations based on their necessity and sufficiency under distribution shift, providing a more faithful criterion than invariance alone.

Result: Experiments on multi-domain benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in OOD performance, particularly under challenging domain shifts.

Conclusion: Causal evaluation of representations is more valuable than mere invariance for achieving robust generalization in OOD classification tasks.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a fundamental challenge in real-world classification, where test distributions often differ substantially from training data. Most existing approaches pursue domain-invariant representations, implicitly assuming that invariance implies reliability. However, features that are invariant across domains are not necessarily causally effective for prediction.
  In this work, we revisit OOD classification from a causal perspective and propose to evaluate learned representations based on their necessity and sufficiency under distribution shift. We introduce an explicit segment-level framework that directly measures causal effectiveness across domains, providing a more faithful criterion than invariance alone.
  Experiments on multi-domain benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in OOD performance, particularly under challenging domain shifts, highlighting the value of causal evaluation for robust generalization.

*Ioannis Anagnostides,Rohan Chauhan,Ioannis Panageas,Tuomas Sandholm,Jingming Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proves a sharp computational phase transition in performative prediction: when performative effects are strong (ρ>1), finding stable models becomes as hard as computing Nash equilibria (PPAD-complete), even for simple quadratic losses and linear shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the computational complexity of finding performatively stable points in different regimes of performative effect strength, particularly when effects are strong (ρ>1) which was previously open.

Method: Computational complexity theory, specifically reductions to establish PPAD-completeness by connecting performative stability to Nash equilibria in general-sum games, with extensions to convex domains and strategic classification settings.

Result: 1) Sharp phase transition: computing ε-performatively stable points is PPAD-complete when ρ=1+O(ε)
2) Intractability persists even with quadratic loss and linear distribution shifts
3) Strategic local optimum computation in strategic classification is PLS-hard

Conclusion: Strong performative effects (ρ>1) create fundamental computational barriers equivalent to solving Nash equilibria, revealing that even seemingly simple performative prediction problems are computationally intractable in the worst case.

Abstract: Performative prediction captures the phenomenon where deploying a predictive model shifts the underlying data distribution. While simple retraining dynamics are known to converge linearly when the performative effects are weak ($ρ< 1$), the complexity in the regime $ρ> 1$ was hitherto open. In this paper, we establish a sharp phase transition: computing an $ε$-performatively stable point is PPAD-complete -- and thus polynomial-time equivalent to Nash equilibria in general-sum games -- even when $ρ= 1 + O(ε)$. This intractability persists even in the ostensibly simple setting with a quadratic loss function and linear distribution shifts. One of our key technical contributions is to extend this PPAD-hardness result to general convex domains, which is of broader interest in the complexity of variational inequalities. Finally, we address the special case of strategic classification, showing that computing a strategic local optimum is PLS-hard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robust RL methods lack the ability to reason about their own learning reliability, leading to either overly conservative behavior when overreacting to noise or catastrophic failures when uncertainty accumulates.

Method: Proposes a meta-cognitive RL framework with a meta-trust variable driven by Value Prediction Error Stability (VPES) that modulates learning dynamics through fail-safe regulation and gradual trust recovery mechanisms.

Result: Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks with reward corruption show the method achieves higher average returns and significantly reduces late-stage training failures compared to strong robustness baselines.

Conclusion: The meta-cognitive framework effectively improves RL robustness by enabling agents to assess, regulate, and recover their learning process, balancing conservatism and risk while preventing catastrophic failures.

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning methods typically focus on suppressing unreliable experiences or corrupted rewards, but they lack the ability to reason about the reliability of their own learning process. As a result, such methods often either overreact to noise by becoming overly conservative or fail catastrophically when uncertainty accumulates.
  In this work, we propose a meta-cognitive reinforcement learning framework that enables an agent to assess, regulate, and recover its learning behavior based on internally estimated reliability signals. The proposed method introduces a meta-trust variable driven by Value Prediction Error Stability (VPES), which modulates learning dynamics via fail-safe regulation and gradual trust recovery.
  Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks with reward corruption demonstrate that recovery-enabled meta-cognitive control achieves higher average returns and significantly reduces late-stage training failures compared to strong robustness baselines.

*Ratnavibusena Don Shahain Manujith,Yang Zhang,Teoh Tze Tzun,Kenji Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeRaDiff introduces a denoising-time realignment technique to dynamically adjust KL regularization strength during diffusion model sampling, eliminating expensive hyperparameter retraining while maintaining alignment quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aligning diffusion models with human preferences require prohibitively expensive hyperparameter sweeps to find optimal KL regularization strength, where improper strength causes either limited alignment or "reward hacking".

Method: Proposes DeRaDiff (Denoising-time Realignment for Diffusion), which modulates regularization strength during sampling by replacing the reverse step reference distribution with a geometric mixture of aligned and reference posteriors, enabling on-the-fly control via a single tunable parameter (λ).

Result: Achieves strong approximation of models trained from scratch at different regularization strengths across text-image alignment and image-quality metrics, without additional training or finetuning.

Conclusion: Enables efficient optimal regularization strength search by replacing costly alignment sweeps with single-model sampling adjustments, substantially reducing computational costs while preserving alignment performance.

Abstract: Recent advances align diffusion models with human preferences to increase aesthetic appeal and mitigate artifacts and biases. Such methods aim to maximize a conditional output distribution aligned with higher rewards whilst not drifting far from a pretrained prior. This is commonly enforced by KL (Kullback Leibler) regularization. As such, a central issue still remains: how does one choose the right regularization strength? Too high of a strength leads to limited alignment and too low of a strength leads to "reward hacking". This renders the task of choosing the correct regularization strength highly non-trivial. Existing approaches sweep over this hyperparameter by aligning a pretrained model at multiple regularization strengths and then choose the best strength. Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive. We introduce DeRaDiff, a denoising time realignment procedure that, after aligning a pretrained model once, modulates the regularization strength during sampling to emulate models trained at other regularization strengths without any additional training or finetuning. Extending decoding-time realignment from language to diffusion models, DeRaDiff operates over iterative predictions of continuous latents by replacing the reverse step reference distribution by a geometric mixture of an aligned and reference posterior, thus giving rise to a closed form update under common schedulers and a single tunable parameter, lambda, for on the fly control. Our experiments show that across multiple text image alignment and image-quality metrics, our method consistently provides a strong approximation for models aligned entirely from scratch at different regularization strengths. Thus, our method yields an efficient way to search for the optimal strength, eliminating the need for expensive alignment sweeps and thereby substantially reducing computational costs.

*Zichao Yu,Ming Li,Wenyi Zhang,Difan Zou,Weiguo Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProFlow is a proximal guidance framework enabling zero-shot physics-consistent sampling from pre-trained generative models without retraining, using a two-step iterative scheme that alternates between physical constraint projection and generative trajectory mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inferring physical fields from sparse observations while strictly satisfying PDEs is fundamental in computational physics. Deep generative models provide powerful data-driven priors, but existing methods cannot enforce hard physical constraints without costly retraining or disrupting the learned prior, creating a critical need for a sampling mechanism that reconciles physical consistency, observational fidelity, and statistical structure of pre-trained priors.

Method: ProFlow employs a two-step iterative scheme: (1) a terminal optimization step that projects flow predictions onto the intersection of physically and observationally consistent sets via proximal minimization, and (2) an interpolation step that maps the refined state back to the generative trajectory to maintain consistency with the learned flow probability path, interpretable as a sequence of local MAP updates.

Result: Comprehensive benchmarks on Poisson, Helmholtz, Darcy, and viscous Burgers' equations demonstrate that ProFlow achieves superior physical and observational consistency and more accurate distributional statistics compared to state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based baselines.

Conclusion: ProFlow successfully addresses the challenge of zero-shot physics-consistent sampling from fixed generative priors without task-specific retraining, offering a rigorous framework that maintains both physical fidelity and the statistical integrity of learned priors across multiple physical systems.

Abstract: Inferring physical fields from sparse observations while strictly satisfying partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental challenge in computational physics. Recently, deep generative models offer powerful data-driven priors for such inverse problems, yet existing methods struggle to enforce hard physical constraints without costly retraining or disrupting the learned generative prior. Consequently, there is a critical need for a sampling mechanism that can reconcile strict physical consistency and observational fidelity with the statistical structure of the pre-trained prior. To this end, we present ProFlow, a proximal guidance framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling, defined as inferring solutions from sparse observations using a fixed generative prior without task-specific retraining. The algorithm employs a rigorous two-step scheme that alternates between: (\romannumeral1) a terminal optimization step, which projects the flow prediction onto the intersection of the physically and observationally consistent sets via proximal minimization; and (\romannumeral2) an interpolation step, which maps the refined state back to the generative trajectory to maintain consistency with the learned flow probability path. This procedure admits a Bayesian interpretation as a sequence of local maximum a posteriori (MAP) updates. Comprehensive benchmarks on Poisson, Helmholtz, Darcy, and viscous Burgers' equations demonstrate that ProFlow achieves superior physical and observational consistency, as well as more accurate distributional statistics, compared to state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based baselines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has empowered large language models to act as intelligent agents, yet training them for long-horizon tasks remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality trajectories, especially under limited resources. Existing methods typically scale up rollout sizes and indiscriminately allocate computational resources among intermediate steps. Such attempts inherently waste substantial computation budget on trivial steps while failing to guarantee sample quality. To address this, we propose \textbf{Spark} (\textbf{S}trategic \textbf{P}olicy-\textbf{A}ware explo\textbf{R}ation via \textbf{K}ey-state dynamic branching), a novel framework that selectively branches at critical decision states for resource-efficient exploration. Our key insight is to activate adaptive branching exploration at critical decision points to probe promising trajectories, thereby achieving precise resource allocation that prioritizes sampling quality over blind coverage. This design leverages the agent's intrinsic decision-making signals to reduce dependence on human priors, enabling the agent to autonomously expand exploration and achieve stronger generalization. Experiments across diverse tasks (e.g., embodied planning), demonstrate that \textsc{Spark} achieves superior success rates with significantly fewer training samples, exhibiting robust generalization even in unseen scenarios.

Abstract: We study black-box optimization of Lipschitz functions under noisy evaluations. Existing adaptive discretization methods implicitly avoid suboptimal regions but do not provide explicit certificates of optimality or measurable progress guarantees. We introduce \textbf{Certificate-Guided Pruning (CGP)}, which maintains an explicit \emph{active set} $A_t$ of potentially optimal points via confidence-adjusted Lipschitz envelopes. Any point outside $A_t$ is certifiably suboptimal with high probability, and under a margin condition with near-optimality dimension $α$, we prove $\Vol(A_t)$ shrinks at a controlled rate yielding sample complexity $\tildeO(\varepsilon^{-(2+α)})$. We develop three extensions: CGP-Adaptive learns $L$ online with $O(\log T)$ overhead; CGP-TR scales to $d > 50$ via trust regions with local certificates; and CGP-Hybrid switches to GP refinement when local smoothness is detected. Experiments on 12 benchmarks ($d \in [2, 100]$) show CGP variants match or exceed strong baselines while providing principled stopping criteria via certificate volume.

Result: 对于全局校准模型，组内误校准与组间误差不平衡的加权和等于"总不公平预算"；在二分类中，该预算等于模型均方误差乘以组间患病率差异。实验表明公平干预主要在公平违规间进行替代，降低准确性会扩大不公平预算。非二分类结果可缓解公平不相容性。

Conclusion: 准确性与公平性在二分类预测中是互补而非对立关系，该恒等式为理解公平性权衡提供了统一框架，并对公平干预的设计和评估具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: We derive an accounting identity for predictive models that links accuracy with common fairness criteria. The identity shows that for globally calibrated models, the weighted sums of miscalibration within groups and error imbalance across groups is equal to a "total unfairness budget." For binary outcomes, this budget is the model's mean-squared error times the difference in group prevalence across outcome classes. The identity nests standard impossibility results as special cases, while also describing inherent tradeoffs when one or more fairness measures are not perfectly satisfied. The results suggest that accuracy and fairness are best viewed as complements in binary prediction tasks: increasing accuracy necessarily shrinks the total unfairness budget and vice-versa. Experiments on benchmark data confirm the theory and show that many fairness interventions largely substitute between fairness violations, and when they reduce accuracy they tend to expand the total unfairness budget. The results extend naturally to prediction tasks with non-binary outcomes, illustrating how additional outcome information can relax fairness incompatibilities and identifying conditions under which the binary-style impossibility does and does not extend to regression tasks.

Abstract: Recently, flow-based generative models have shown superior efficiency compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we study rectified flow models, which constrain transport trajectories to be linear from the base distribution to the data distribution. This structural restriction greatly accelerates sampling, often enabling high-quality generation with a single Euler step. Under standard assumptions on the neural network classes used to parameterize the velocity field and data distribution, we prove that rectified flows achieve sample complexity $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$. This improves on the best known $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$ bounds for flow matching model and matches the optimal rate for mean estimation. Our analysis exploits the particular structure of rectified flows: because the model is trained with a squared loss along linear paths, the associated hypothesis class admits a sharply controlled localized Rademacher complexity. This yields the improved, order-optimal sample complexity and provides a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of rectified flow models.

Abstract: We present two machine learning frameworks for forecasting aggregated curves and optimizing storage in the EPEX SPOT day-ahead market. First, a fast parametric model forecasts hourly demand and supply curves in a low-dimensional and grid-robust representation, with minimum and maximum volumes combined with a Chebyshev polynomial for the elastic segment. The model enables daily use with low error and clear interpretability. Second, for a more comprehensive analysis, though less suited to daily operation, we employ generative models that learn the joint distribution of 24-hour order-level submissions given weather and fuel variables. These models generate synthetic daily scenarios of individual buy and sell orders, which, once aggregated, yield hourly supply and demand curves. Based on these forecasts, we optimize a price-making storage strategy, quantify revenue distributions, and highlight the price-compression effect with lower peaks, higher off-peak levels, and diminishing returns as capacity expands.

*Long Van Tran,Truyen Tran,Phuoc Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个在时间戳缺失或损坏时恢复随机微分方程时序并估计参数的框架，利用得分匹配和前后向过程的不对称性来重建观测序列的时序关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机微分方程的参数估计依赖于精确的时间戳序列，但当时间顺序被破坏、缺失或故意隐藏（如出于隐私保护）时，现有方法往往失效。

Method: 该研究利用前向与后向过程的不对称性，通过得分匹配准则推断观测对之间的正确时序，再通过排序程序恢复完整时序，最后基于重建序列使用最大似然估计SDE参数，实现时序重建与参数估计的同步进行。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法将参数估计扩展到缺乏时序信息的场景，拓展了随机微分方程在敏感领域的适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have enabled robust modeling of real-world dynamical processes across diverse domains, such as finance, health, and systems biology. However, parameter estimation for SDEs typically relies on accurately timestamped observational sequences. When temporal ordering information is corrupted, missing, or deliberately hidden (e.g., for privacy), existing estimation methods often fail. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which temporal order can be recovered and introduce a novel framework that simultaneously reconstructs temporal information and estimates SDE parameters. Our approach exploits asymmetries between forward and backward processes, deriving a score-matching criterion to infer the correct temporal order between pairs of observations. We then recover the total order via a sorting procedure and estimate SDE parameters from the reconstructed sequence using maximum likelihood. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, extending parameter estimation to settings with missing temporal order and broadening applicability in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Bridging the sim2real gap between computationally inexpensive models and complex physical systems remains a central challenge in machine learning applications to engineering problems, particularly in multi-scale settings where reduced-order models typically capture only dominant dynamics. In this work, we present Cheap2Rich, a multi-scale data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-fidelity state spaces from sparse sensor histories by combining a fast low-fidelity prior with learned, interpretable discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on rotating detonation engines (RDEs), a challenging class of systems that couple detonation-front propagation with injector-driven unsteadiness, mixing, and stiff chemistry across disparate scales. Our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity RDE states from sparse measurements while isolating physically meaningful discrepancy dynamics associated with injector-driven effects. The results highlight a general multi-fidelity framework for data assimilation and system identification in complex multi-scale systems, enabling rapid design exploration and real-time monitoring and control while providing interpretable discrepancy dynamics.

### [113] [Truthfulness Despite Weak Supervision: Evaluating and Training LLMs Using Peer Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20299)
*Tianyi Alex Qiu,Micah Carroll,Cameron Allen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 我们引入了一种基于peer prediction的LLM评估与训练方法，该方法无需真实标签，通过模型间相互预测性奖励诚实回答，对欺骗具有鲁棒性，且随着模型能力差距增大效果反而增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM评估与后训练依赖监督，但困难任务的强监督往往不可得，模型易利用不完美监督产生欺骗性结果；传统LLM-as-a-Judge在面对比自身大5-20倍的欺骗模型时甚至比随机猜测更差。

Method: 从机制设计理论引入peer prediction方法，基于模型回答的相互预测性构建奖励机制，激励诚实 informative 的回答，无需真实标签。

Result: 理论保证+405B参数模型实证验证；用该方法训练的8B模型能恢复恶意微调后的真实性损失，即使奖励模型仅0.135B；发现逆缩放现象：专家与参与者能力差距越大，抗欺骗能力越强；LLM-as-a-Judge在5-20倍差距时失效，peer prediction在100倍差距时仍有效。

Conclusion: Peer prediction为弱监督下可靠评估与训练强模型提供了有前景的解决方案，特别适用于传统方法失效的场景。

Abstract: The evaluation and post-training of large language models (LLMs) rely on supervision, but strong supervision for difficult tasks is often unavailable, especially when evaluating frontier models. In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.

*Yueyang Wang,Jiawei Fu,Baolong Bi,Xili Wang,Xiaoqing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对大型语言模型在软件工程任务中期训练缺乏有效指导指标的问题，提出基于熵压缩假说的新型HE-SNR指标，替代存在"长上下文税"问题的困惑度指标，在工业级MoE模型上展现出更优的鲁棒性和预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SWE-bench基准测试显示LLM能力主要在中期训练获得，但缺乏有效的训练指导指标。标准困惑度(PPL)指标受"长上下文税"影响，且与下游软件工程性能相关性弱，无法有效指导中期训练。

Method: 首先提出严格的数据过滤策略，进而提出熵压缩假说，将智能重新定义为将不确定性结构化到低阶熵压缩状态的能力（"合理的犹豫"），并基于此构建了HE-SNR（高熵信噪比）指标。

Result: 在32K/128K不同上下文窗口的工业级专家混合模型上验证表明，HE-SNR指标具有卓越的鲁棒性和预测能力，能有效指导中期训练。

Conclusion: 本研究为优化LLM在复杂工程领域的潜在能力提供了理论基础和实用工具，填补了中期训练指导指标的空白。

Abstract: SWE-bench has emerged as the premier benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models on complex software engineering tasks. While these capabilities are fundamentally acquired during the mid-training phase and subsequently elicited during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), there remains a critical deficit in metrics capable of guiding mid-training effectively. Standard metrics such as Perplexity (PPL) are compromised by the "Long-Context Tax" and exhibit weak correlation with downstream SWE performance. In this paper, we bridge this gap by first introducing a rigorous data filtering strategy. Crucially, we propose the Entropy Compression Hypothesis, redefining intelligence not by scalar Top-1 compression, but by the capacity to structure uncertainty into Entropy-Compressed States of low orders ("reasonable hesitation"). Grounded in this fine-grained entropy analysis, we formulate a novel metric, HE-SNR (High-Entropy Signal-to-Noise Ratio). Validated on industrial-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models across varying context windows (32K/128K), our approach demonstrates superior robustness and predictive power. This work provides both the theoretical foundation and practical tools for optimizing the latent potential of LLMs in complex engineering domains.

Method: 在完成的数独网格上训练流匹配和基于分数的模型（视为连续松弛空间），比较确定性ODE采样、随机SDE采样和DDPM风格离散化，并测试通过固定线索的引导生成。

Result: 随机采样显著优于确定性流；基于分数的采样器在连续时间方法中最可靠；DDPM风格祖先采样整体有效性最高。模型可作为概率数独求解器，但样本效率低于经典方法。

Conclusion: 经典扩散/流公式能够为全局约束的组合结构分配非零概率质量，并能通过随机搜索用于约束满足。

Abstract: Can standard continuous-time generative models represent distributions whose support is an extremely sparse, globally constrained discrete set? We study this question using completed Sudoku grids as a controlled testbed, treating them as a subset of a continuous relaxation space. We train flow-matching and score-based models along a Gaussian probability path and compare deterministic (ODE) sampling, stochastic (SDE) sampling, and DDPM-style discretizations derived from the same continuous-time training. Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver. Although far less sample-efficient than classical solvers and discrete-geometry-aware diffusion methods, these experiments demonstrate that classic diffusion/flow formulations can assign non-zero probability mass to globally constrained combinatorial structures and can be used for constraint satisfaction via stochastic search.

TL;DR: The paper proposes C2, a framework that enhances Decision Transformer for auto-bidding by adding a Cross Learning Block to better model correlations between sequences and a Constraint-aware Loss to selectively learn optimal behaviors, achieving up to 3.23% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision Transformer shows promise for generative auto-bidding but suffers from two critical limitations: insufficient cross-correlation modeling among state, action, and return-to-go sequences, and indiscriminate learning of both optimal and suboptimal behaviors, which hinders its performance.

Method: The authors propose C2 framework with two core innovations: (1) a Cross Learning Block (CLB) using cross-attention mechanism to strengthen inter-sequence correlation modeling, and (2) a Constraint-aware Loss (CL) that incorporates budget and Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA) constraints to enable selective learning of optimal trajectories.

Result: Extensive offline evaluations on the AuctionNet dataset demonstrate consistent performance gains of up to 3.23% over the state-of-the-art GAVE across diverse budget settings. Ablation studies verify the complementary synergy between CLB and CL components.

Conclusion: The C2 framework demonstrates superiority in auto-bidding tasks by effectively addressing DT's limitations, with both proposed innovations working synergistically to improve performance.

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT) shows promise for generative auto-bidding by capturing temporal dependencies, but suffers from two critical limitations: insufficient cross-correlation modeling among state, action, and return-to-go (RTG) sequences, and indiscriminate learning of optimal/suboptimal behaviors.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了隐私领域的自动化数据清洗难题，在效果与效率上均显著优于现有方法，为LLM领域适应提供了新范式

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data to enhance their performance in specialized fields. However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: FedRD有效解决了异构联邦学习中的发散问题，为参与和未参与的客户端生成最优模型。

Abstract: Heterogeneous federated learning (HFL) aims to ensure effective and privacy-preserving collaboration among different entities. As newly joined clients require significant adjustments and additional training to align with the existing system, the problem of generalizing federated learning models to unseen clients under heterogeneous data has become progressively crucial. Consequently, we highlight two unsolved challenging issues in federated domain generalization: Optimization Divergence and Performance Divergence. To tackle the above challenges, we propose FedRD, a novel heterogeneity-aware federated learning algorithm that collaboratively utilizes parameter-guided global generalization aggregation and local debiased classification to reduce divergences, aiming to obtain an optimal global model for participating and unseen clients. Extensive experiments on public multi-domain datasets demonstrate that our approach exhibits a substantial performance advantage over competing baselines in addressing this specific problem.

Conclusion: 开启了关于混合公平性的更广泛讨论，为XAI及其他领域的公平性提供了新视角

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is becoming increasingly essential for enhancing the transparency of machine learning (ML) models. Among the various XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations (CFs) hold a pivotal role due to their ability to illustrate how changes in input features can alter an ML model's decision, thereby offering actionable recourse to users. Ensuring that individuals with comparable attributes and those belonging to different protected groups (e.g., demographic) receive similar and actionable recourse options is essential for trustworthy and fair decision-making. In this work, we address this challenge directly by focusing on the generation of fair CFs. Specifically, we start by defining and formulating fairness at: 1) individual fairness, ensuring that similar individuals receive similar CFs, 2) group fairness, ensuring equitable CFs across different protected groups and 3) hybrid fairness, which accounts for both individual and broader group-level fairness. We formulate the problem as an optimization task and propose a novel model-agnostic, reinforcement learning based approach to generate CFs that satisfy fairness constraints at both the individual and group levels, two objectives that are usually treated as orthogonal. As fairness metrics, we extend existing metrics commonly used for auditing ML models, such as equal choice of recourse and equal effectiveness across individuals and groups. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, showing that it effectively ensures individual and group fairness while preserving the quality of the generated CFs in terms of proximity and plausibility, and quantify the cost of fairness in the different levels separately. Our work opens a broader discussion on hybrid fairness and its role and implications for XAI and beyond CFs.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the role of attention layers in LLMs as memory mechanisms, linking them to human cue-based retrieval. It hypothesizes that keywords act as retrieval cues, identifies neurons encoding these keywords, and applies them to tasks like unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulatory pressures for transparency and privacy-preserving unlearning in XAI drive interest, but the role of attention layers in transformer-based LLMs remains underexplored despite advances in XAI.

Method: Draws on psychology (Encoding Specificity Principle) and computational psycholinguistics to frame attention mechanisms as memory retrieval. Tests a "keywords-as-cues" hypothesis by analyzing neuron activations in attention layers.

Result: Provides converging evidence that keywords serve as retrieval cues in attention layers. Successfully isolates neurons that selectively encode context-defining keywords and facilitate their retrieval.

Conclusion: Keywords extracted from identified neurons can be leveraged for downstream applications like privacy-preserving machine unlearning, advancing XAI for LLMs.

Abstract: While explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for large language models (LLMs) remains an evolving field with many unresolved questions, increasing regulatory pressures have spurred interest in its role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and privacy-preserving machine unlearning. Despite recent advances in XAI have provided some insights, the specific role of attention layers in transformer based LLMs remains underexplored. This study investigates the memory mechanisms instantiated by attention layers, drawing on prior research in psychology and computational psycholinguistics that links Transformer attention to cue based retrieval in human memory. In this view, queries encode the retrieval context, keys index candidate memory traces, attention weights quantify cue trace similarity, and values carry the encoded content, jointly enabling the construction of a context representation that precedes and facilitates memory retrieval. Guided by the Encoding Specificity Principle, we hypothesize that the cues used in the initial stage of retrieval are instantiated as keywords. We provide converging evidence for this keywords-as-cues hypothesis. In addition, we isolate neurons within attention layers whose activations selectively encode and facilitate the retrieval of context-defining keywords. Consequently, these keywords can be extracted from identified neurons and further contribute to downstream applications such as unlearning.

TL;DR: Proposes CCMamba, a mamba-based framework for topological deep learning on combinatorial complexes that replaces quadratic attention with linear-time state-space models for scalable higher-order relational learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard graph neural networks cannot capture higher-order relational structures beyond pairwise interactions. Existing topological deep learning methods using combinatorial complexes rely on attention-based message passing with quadratic complexity and low-dimensional limitations, hindering scalability and rank-aware information aggregation.

Method: Reformulates message passing as selective state-space modeling by organizing multi-rank incidence relations into structured sequences processed by rank-aware state-space models (Mamba), enabling adaptive, directional, and long-range information propagation in linear time without self-attention.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows CCMamba's expressive power is bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Experiments on graph, hypergraph, and simplicial benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements over existing methods with better scalability and depth robustness.

Conclusion: CCMamba provides the first unified mamba-based solution for combinatorial complex learning, overcoming computational bottlenecks of attention mechanisms while maintaining theoretical expressiveness guarantees.

Abstract: Topological deep learning has emerged for modeling higher-order relational structures beyond pairwise interactions that standard graph neural networks fail to capture. Although combinatorial complexes offer a unified topological framework, most existing topological deep learning methods rely on local message passing via attention mechanisms, which incur quadratic complexity and remain low-dimensional, limiting scalability and rank-aware information aggregation in higher-order complexes.We propose Combinatorial Complex Mamba (CCMamba), the first unified mamba-based neural framework for learning on combinatorial complexes. CCMamba reformulates message passing as a selective state-space modeling problem by organizing multi-rank incidence relations into structured sequences processed by rank-aware state-space models. This enables adaptive, directional, and long range information propagation in linear time without self attention. We further establish the theoretical analysis that the expressive power upper-bound of CCMamba message passing is the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Experiments on graph, hypergraph, and simplicial benchmarks demonstrate that CCMamba consistently outperforms existing methods while exhibiting improved scalability and robustness to depth.

### [122] [A Learning-based Framework for Spatial Impulse Response Compensation in 3D Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20291)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a learned data-domain framework to compensate for transducer spatial impulse responses in 3D photoacoustic computed tomography, enabling fast and accurate image reconstruction through U-Net and Deconv-Net models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-area ultrasound transducers in PACT improve sensitivity but degrade spatial resolution when using fast analytic reconstruction methods that ignore spatial impulse responses (SIRs). While optimization-based methods can model SIR, they are computationally prohibitive for 3D imaging, creating a need for accurate yet rapid reconstruction.

Method: The authors developed a learned SIR compensation framework that maps corrupted measurement data to ideal point-transducer data using two neural network architectures (U-Net and physics-inspired Deconv-Net), with fast analytical training data generation. The compensated data can then be processed by efficient analytic reconstruction.

Result: Virtual imaging studies demonstrated improved spatial resolution and robustness to noise, object complexity, and sound speed variations. In-vivo breast imaging revealed fine structures previously obscured by SIR artifacts. This represents the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT.

Conclusion: The learned compensation framework successfully bridges the gap between reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency in 3D PACT, offering a practical solution for clinical translation by enabling fast, high-quality imaging without the computational burden of iterative methods.

Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical contrast with ultrasound detection. Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging.

Abstract: Unsupervised ensemble learning emerged to address the challenge of combining multiple learners' predictions without access to ground truth labels or additional data. This paradigm is crucial in scenarios where evaluating individual classifier performance or understanding their strengths is challenging due to limited information. We propose a novel deep energy-based method for constructing an accurate meta-learner using only the predictions of individual learners, potentially capable of capturing complex dependence structures between them. Our approach requires no labeled data, learner features, or problem-specific information, and has theoretical guarantees for when learners are conditionally independent. We demonstrate superior performance across diverse ensemble scenarios, including challenging mixture of experts settings. Our experiments span standard ensemble datasets and curated datasets designed to test how the model fuses expertise from multiple sources. These results highlight the potential of unsupervised ensemble learning to harness collective intelligence, especially in data-scarce or privacy-sensitive environments.

Abstract: Specifications for decentralized learning on resource-constrained edge devices require algorithms that are communication-efficient, robust to data corruption, and lightweight in memory usage. While state-of-the-art gossip-based methods satisfy the first requirement, achieving robustness remains challenging. Asynchronous decentralized ADMM-based methods have been explored for estimating the median, a statistical centrality measure that is notoriously more robust than the mean. However, existing approaches require memory that scales with node degree, making them impractical when memory is limited. In this paper, we propose AsylADMM, a novel gossip algorithm for decentralized median and quantile estimation, primarily designed for asynchronous updates and requiring only two variables per node. We analyze a synchronous variant of AsylADMM to establish theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate fast convergence for the asynchronous algorithm. We then show that our algorithm enables quantile-based trimming, geometric median estimation, and depth-based trimming, with quantile-based trimming empirically outperforming existing rank-based methods. Finally, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of rank-based trimming via Markov chain theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Ranking-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a novel RL framework that jointly optimizes regression and ranking tasks via a unified ranking-aware reward and response mutation operations to model ordinal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ordinal regression and ranking face challenges due to inherent ordinal dependencies that conventional methods cannot effectively model, limiting their ability to capture the relationships between tasks.

Method: RARL framework with three core components: (1) a unified objective integrating regression and Learning-to-Rank (L2R) for mutual enhancement, (2) a ranking-aware verifiable reward that jointly assesses regression precision and ranking accuracy to enable direct policy optimization, and (3) Response Mutation Operations (RMO) that inject controlled noise to improve exploration and prevent saddle point stagnation.

Result: The method's effectiveness was validated through extensive experiments on three distinct benchmarks, though specific performance metrics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: RARL successfully addresses ordinal dependency modeling by synergistically combining regression and ranking through reinforcement learning, demonstrating strong empirical performance with its unified reward mechanism and exploration strategy.

Abstract: Ordinal regression and ranking are challenging due to inherent ordinal dependencies that conventional methods struggle to model. We propose Ranking-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a novel RL framework that explicitly learns these relationships. At its core, RARL features a unified objective that synergistically integrates regression and Learning-to-Rank (L2R), enabling mutual improvement between the two tasks. This is driven by a ranking-aware verifiable reward that jointly assesses regression precision and ranking accuracy, facilitating direct model updates via policy optimization. To further enhance training, we introduce Response Mutation Operations (RMO), which inject controlled noise to improve exploration and prevent stagnation at saddle points. The effectiveness of RARL is validated through extensive experiments on three distinct benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文针对在线广告排序中GMV预测的延迟反馈问题，构建了TRACE基准数据集并提出了READER双分支模型，通过路由机制动态激活专家参数并校准回归目标，在准确率上相比基线提升2.19%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线广告排序模型的预测目标正从转化率(CVR)等概率指标转向成交总额(GMV)等数值业务指标。与已有研究的CVR延迟反馈问题不同，GMV预测的延迟反馈建模尚未被探索且更具挑战性，因为GMV是连续目标，且单次点击可能引发多次购买累积形成标签。

Method: 构建TRACE基准数据集，包含用户点击产生的完整交易序列，支持在线流式延迟反馈建模；提出READER模型，采用双分支架构，通过路由器根据复购预测选择激活专家参数，并动态校准回归目标以缓解标签不完整导致的低估问题。

Result: 在TRACE基准上的实验结果表明，READER相比基线模型取得了2.19%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为GMV预测的延迟反馈建模开辟了新方向，TRACE基准及相关发现将促进该领域未来的研究和应用发展。

Abstract: The prediction objectives of online advertisement ranking models are evolving from probabilistic metrics like conversion rate (CVR) to numerical business metrics like post-click gross merchandise volume (GMV). Unlike the well-studied delayed feedback problem in CVR prediction, delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction remains unexplored and poses greater challenges, as GMV is a continuous target, and a single click can lead to multiple purchases that cumulatively form the label. To bridge the research gap, we establish TRACE, a GMV prediction benchmark containing complete transaction sequences rising from each user click, which supports delayed feedback modeling in an online streaming manner. Our analysis and exploratory experiments on TRACE reveal two key insights: (1) the rapid evolution of the GMV label distribution necessitates modeling delayed feedback under online streaming training; (2) the label distribution of repurchase samples substantially differs from that of single-purchase samples, highlighting the need for separate modeling. Motivated by these findings, we propose RepurchasE-Aware Dual-branch prEdictoR (READER), a novel GMV modeling paradigm that selectively activates expert parameters according to repurchase predictions produced by a router. Moreover, READER dynamically calibrates the regression target to mitigate under-estimation caused by incomplete labels. Experimental results show that READER yields superior performance on TRACE over baselines, achieving a 2.19% improvement in terms of accuracy. We believe that our study will open up a new avenue for studying online delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction, and our TRACE benchmark with the gathered insights will facilitate future research and application in this promising direction. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/alimama-tech/OnlineGMV .

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种正则化的GTD算法(R-GTD)，通过重构MSPBE最小化目标，解决了当特征交互矩阵奇异时传统GTD算法的不稳定性问题，保证了收敛到唯一解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的梯度时序差分(GTD)学习算法在离策略评估中需要特征交互矩阵(FIM)非奇异这一限制性假设，而实际应用中FIM常为奇异矩阵，导致算法不稳定或性能下降。

Method: 通过重构均方投影贝尔曼误差(MSPBE)最小化问题，提出一个正则化优化目标，从而导出正则化GTD算法(R-GTD)。

Result: 建立了理论收敛保证和显式误差界，证明R-GTD即使在FIM奇异时也能收敛到唯一解。

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验验证表明，R-GTD算法有效解决了FIM奇异导致的稳定性问题，为离策略评估提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Gradient temporal-difference (GTD) learning algorithms are widely used for off-policy policy evaluation with function approximation. However, existing convergence analyses rely on the restrictive assumption that the so-called feature interaction matrix (FIM) is nonsingular. In practice, the FIM can become singular and leads to instability or degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a regularized optimization objective by reformulating the mean-square projected Bellman error (MSPBE) minimization. This formulation naturally yields a regularized GTD algorithms, referred to as R-GTD, which guarantees convergence to a unique solution even when the FIM is singular. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees and explicit error bounds for the proposed method, and validate its effectiveness through empirical experiments.

TL;DR: 提出一种窗口化的Token剪枝与缓存方法，通过利用扩散语言模型推理中的结构局部性，在保持生成性能的同时实现高达99倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在迭代去噪过程中需要对全部序列进行注意力计算，导致在掩码Token上产生大量冗余计算；而现有的分层扩散方法需要重新训练且受更新顺序限制，难以直接应用于预训练模型。

Method: 基于结构局部性观察，维护一个随去噪过程向右滑动的局部计算窗口，将未解码Token分为三类：在线计算的活跃Token、缓存KV状态的缓冲Token、以及窗口外被剪枝的远场Token，仅对窗口内的活跃和缓冲Token进行计算。

Result: 在LLaDA和Dream模型上，该方法在匹配计算预算下实现了高达99倍的推理加速，同时基本保持了生成性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用Token级结构局部性和时间稳定性，无需重训练即可显著降低预训练扩散语言模型的推理成本，具有实用性和通用性。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate text through iterative denoising, but inference requires full-sequence attention at every iteration, resulting in substantial redundant computation on masked tokens. Block-wise diffusion can reduce this cost, yet it typically relies on retraining and constrained update orders, limiting its direct applicability to pretrained DLMs. Our token-level analysis reveals pronounced structural locality in DLM inference. Decoding is driven by a small set of prefix-localized active tokens; the influence of distant undecoded context diminishes rapidly, and decoded tokens exhibit stage-wise temporal stability, enabling reuse of intermediate representations except for a brief post-decode transient. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textbf{\placeholder}\footnote{The source code is available at https://github.com/vhicrgit/Window-Diffusion.}, a window-based token pruning and caching method for inference. We maintain a local computation window that slides rightward as denoising progresses, and partition undecoded tokens into: (i) \textit{active tokens} that are computed online, (ii) \textit{buffer tokens} whose KV states are cached and periodically refreshed, and (iii) \textit{far-field tokens} that are pruned outside the window. Computation is restricted to active and buffer tokens within the window, while far-field tokens are omitted at each stage. Experiments on LLaDA and Dream show that, under matched compute budgets, our method achieves up to $99\times$ inference speedup while largely preserving generation performance.

Conclusion: 平均流框架通过消除轨迹模拟需求，为单细胞动态重建提供了可扩展的解决方案，使其适用于大规模应用。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamical evolution from limited observations is a fundamental challenge in single-cell biology, where dynamic unbalanced optimal transport provides a principled framework for modeling coupled transport and mass variation. However, existing approaches rely on trajectory simulation at inference time, making inference a key bottleneck for scalable applications. In this work, we propose a mean-flow framework for unbalanced flow matching that summarizes both transport and mass-growth dynamics over arbitrary time intervals using mean velocity and mass-growth fields, enabling fast one-step generation without trajectory simulation. To solve dynamic unbalanced optimal transport under the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao geometry, we further build on this framework to develop Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao Mean Flow Matching (WFR-MFM). Across synthetic and real single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, WFR-MFM achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference than a range of existing baselines while maintaining high predictive accuracy, and enables efficient perturbation response prediction on large synthetic datasets with thousands of conditions.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has proven effective for accelerating LLM inference by quickly generating draft tokens and verifying them in parallel. However, SD remains largely unexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which extend LLMs to process both image and text prompts. To address this gap, we benchmark existing inference methods with small draft models on 11 datasets across diverse input scenarios and observe scenario-specific performance fluctuations. Motivated by these findings, we propose Test-time Adaptive Batched Ensemble Drafting (TABED), which dynamically ensembles multiple drafts obtained via batch inference by leveraging deviations from past ground truths available in the SD setting. The dynamic ensemble method achieves an average robust walltime speedup of 1.74x over autoregressive decoding and a 5% improvement over single drafting methods, while remaining training-free and keeping ensembling costs negligible through parameter sharing. With its plug-and-play compatibility, we further enhance TABED by integrating advanced verification and alternative drafting methods.

Conclusion: 所提度量能有效检测扩散模型的记忆化现象，并可应用于自适应记忆化提示的缓解策略，提升模型安全性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generative models produce high-fidelity images through iterative denoising but remain vulnerable to memorization, where they unintentionally reproduce exact copies or parts of training images. Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by utilizing a mitigation strategy that adapts memorized prompts based on our developed metric.

TL;DR: TINNs improve PINNs for time-dependent PDEs by making network weights time-dependent, achieving 4x better accuracy and 10x faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs use shared weights across all times, forcing the same features to represent different dynamics, which degrades accuracy and destabilizes training when enforcing PDE, boundary, and initial constraints jointly.

Method: Propose Time-Induced Neural Networks (TINNs) that parameterize network weights as learned functions of time, allowing spatial representations to evolve over time while maintaining shared structure. The formulation becomes a nonlinear least-squares problem optimized with Levenberg-Marquardt method.

Result: Experiments on various time-dependent PDEs show up to 4× improved accuracy and 10× faster convergence compared to PINNs and strong baselines.

Conclusion: TINNs provide a more effective approach for solving time-dependent PDEs by adapting network representations over time, significantly outperforming standard PINNs in both accuracy and training efficiency.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) solve time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning a mesh-free, differentiable solution that can be evaluated anywhere in space and time. However, standard space--time PINNs take time as an input but reuse a single network with shared weights across all times, forcing the same features to represent markedly different dynamics. This coupling degrades accuracy and can destabilize training when enforcing PDE, boundary, and initial constraints jointly. We propose Time-Induced Neural Networks (TINNs), a novel architecture that parameterizes the network weights as a learned function of time, allowing the effective spatial representation to evolve over time while maintaining shared structure. The resulting formulation naturally yields a nonlinear least-squares problem, which we optimize efficiently using a Levenberg--Marquardt method. Experiments on various time-dependent PDEs show up to $4\times$ improved accuracy and $10\times$ faster convergence compared to PINNs and strong baselines.

Conclusion: 上下文感知监控框架比传统集成方法更能有效利用控制器多样性，为AI控制系统提供安全保障。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning context-aware runtime monitors for AI-based control ensembles. Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in real-world applications where environmental conditions are non-stationary, particularly when reward functions shift or the available action space expands. This paper introduces MORPHIN, a self-adaptive Q-learning framework that enables on-the-fly adaptation without full retraining. By integrating concept drift detection with dynamic adjustments to learning and exploration hyperparameters, MORPHIN adapts agents to changes in both the reward function and on-the-fly expansions of the agent's action space, while preserving prior policy knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our approach using a Gridworld benchmark and a traffic signal control simulation. The results demonstrate that MORPHIN achieves superior convergence speed and continuous adaptation compared to a standard Q-learning baseline, improving learning efficiency by up to 1.7x.

Motivation: 大语言模型部署受内存墙限制，需极低比特量化，但现有量化感知训练(QAT)方法过早离散化导致梯度失配，阻碍模型优化

Method: 用温度控制的softmax松弛替代硬阶跃函数，保持早期梯度流；利用张量级Hessian迹作为曲率信号，驱动细粒度温度退火，实现敏感度感知的量化

Conclusion: Hessian引导的松弛策略有效恢复模型表征能力，为1.58-bit LLM提供了更鲁棒的训练路径

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, deployment is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory wall, motivating a shift toward extremely low-bit quantization. However, most quantization-aware training (QAT) methods apply hard rounding and the straight-through estimator (STE) from the beginning of the training, which prematurely discretizes the optimization landscape and induces persistent gradient mismatch between latent weights and quantized weights, hindering effective optimization of quantized models. To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model. Evaluations on Llama-3.2 show that Hestia consistently outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines, yielding average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for the 1B and 3B models. These results indicate that Hessian-guided relaxation effectively recovers representational capacity, establishing a more robust training path for 1.58-bit LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/hestia2026/Hestia.

TL;DR: 提出condPED-ANOVA框架，用于在超参数存在条件依赖关系的搜索空间中正确评估超参数重要性，解决了传统PED-ANOVA无法处理条件超参数的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超参数重要性评估方法（如PED-ANOVA）假设搜索空间是固定且无条件的，但实际场景中许多超参数的激活或取值范围依赖于其他超参数，导致现有方法在条件搜索空间中产生误导性结果。

Method: 提出conditional PED-ANOVA (condPED-ANOVA)，引入针对高性能区域的条件超参数重要性定义，并推导出能够准确反映条件激活和域变化的闭式估计器。

Result: 实验表明，简单适配现有方法在条件设置下会得到误导性或不可解释的重要性估计，而condPED-ANOVA能持续提供反映底层条件结构的有意义重要性评分。

Conclusion: condPED-ANOVA为条件搜索空间中的超参数重要性评估提供了原则性框架，对于理解和优化现实机器学习中的条件超参数配置至关重要。

Abstract: We propose conditional PED-ANOVA (condPED-ANOVA), a principled framework for estimating hyperparameter importance (HPI) in conditional search spaces, where the presence or domain of a hyperparameter can depend on other hyperparameters. Although the original PED-ANOVA provides a fast and efficient way to estimate HPI within the top-performing regions of the search space, it assumes a fixed, unconditional search space and therefore cannot properly handle conditional hyperparameters. To address this, we introduce a conditional HPI for top-performing regions and derive a closed-form estimator that accurately reflects conditional activation and domain changes. Experiments show that naive adaptations of existing HPI estimators yield misleading or uninterpretable importance estimates in conditional settings, whereas condPED-ANOVA consistently provides meaningful importances that reflect the underlying conditional structure.

Motivation: 现有可验证奖励强化学习方法仅使用标量结果奖励，忽视了运行时错误、评测结果等丰富文本反馈，导致信用分配困难，学习效率低下。

Method: SDPO将带反馈的当前模型视为自教师，通过蒸馏其反馈感知的下一token预测来优化策略，无需外部教师或显式奖励模型，实现从丰富反馈中学习。

Result: 在LiveCodeBench v6等任务上，SDPO相比强基线提升样本效率和最终准确率；即使仅有标量反馈也能通过成功回合作为隐式反馈；测试时3倍减少尝试次数即可达到同等发现概率。

Conclusion: SDPO通过自蒸馏机制有效利用模型自身的上下文错误识别能力，将丰富反馈转化为密集学习信号，为可验证领域强化学习提供了高效的新范式。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly post-trained with reinforcement learning in verifiable domains such as code and math. Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts.

Our approach comprises four key components: (1) a Hierarchical Scattering Transform Module (HSTM) that extracts multi-scale invariant features capturing both local and global patterns; (2) a Scale-Adaptive Feature Enhancement (SAFE) module that dynamically adjusts feature importance across different scales; (3) a Multi-Resolution Temporal Attention (MRTA) mechanism that learns dependencies at varying time horizons; and (4) a Trend-Seasonal-Residual (TSR) decomposition-guided structure-aware loss function. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that ScatterFusion outperforms other common methods, achieving significant reductions in error metrics across various prediction horizons.

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires capturing patterns across multiple temporal scales while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper introduces AWGformer, a novel architecture that integrates adaptive wavelet decomposition with cross-scale attention mechanisms for enhanced multi-variate time series prediction. Our approach comprises: (1) an Adaptive Wavelet Decomposition Module (AWDM) that dynamically selects optimal wavelet bases and decomposition levels based on signal characteristics; (2) a Cross-Scale Feature Fusion (CSFF) mechanism that captures interactions between different frequency bands through learnable coupling matrices; (3) a Frequency-Aware Multi-Head Attention (FAMA) module that weights attention heads according to their frequency selectivity; (4) a Hierarchical Prediction Network (HPN) that generates forecasts at multiple resolutions before reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出失败前缀条件化方法，通过利用错误推理轨迹的前缀重新分配探索，解决RLVR训练在饱和问题上的停滞问题，性能提升显著且保持标记效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练在问题饱和时经常停滞，核心挑战是信息性失败的可及性差：学习信号存在但在标准推演中很少遇到

Method: 失败前缀条件化：通过条件化训练在来自罕见错误推理轨迹的前缀上，将探索重新分配到容易失败的状态

Result: 性能提升与在中等难度问题上训练相当，保持标记效率；减少误导性失败前缀下的性能退化，但轻微牺牲对正确早期推理的遵循；迭代刷新失败前缀可解锁额外增益

Conclusion: 失败前缀条件化为扩展RLVR在饱和问题上的训练提供了有效途径

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet training often stalls as problems become saturated. We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.

TL;DR: 提出Concept Component Analysis (ConCA)框架，通过线性混合模型从LLM表征中提取人类可解释概念，为稀疏自动编码器(SAEs)提供理论依据，并在多个LLM上验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)在关键领域的部署需要人类可理解的解释，但现有稀疏自动编码器(SAEs)缺乏理论基础，导致LLM表征与人类概念间的对应关系模糊，方法设计和评估困难。

Method: 将LLM表征建模为概念对数后验的线性混合，提出Concept Component Analysis (ConCA)框架，通过无监督线性解混恢复概念对数后验，并引入稀疏先验解决解混问题的病态性。

Result: 实现了12种稀疏ConCA变体，在多个LLM上成功提取出有意义的概念，相比SAEs具有理论支撑的优势。

Conclusion: ConCA为LLM可解释性提供了原则性理论框架，通过显式建模概念生成过程，解决了SAEs的理论模糊性，为 mechanistic interpretability 奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: Developing human understandable interpretation of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly critical for their deployment in essential domains. Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables. This motivates a principled framework for concept extraction, namely Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), which aims to recover the log-posterior of each concept from LLM representations through a {unsupervised} linear unmixing process. We explore a specific variant, termed sparse ConCA, which leverages a sparsity prior to address the inherent ill-posedness of the unmixing problem. We implement 12 sparse ConCA variants and demonstrate their ability to extract meaningful concepts across multiple LLMs, offering theory-backed advantages over SAEs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现奖励模型(RM)的行为显著受基础大模型影响：Llama系列偏好"能动性"(agency)，Gemma系列偏好"共情性"(communion)，即使训练数据和微调过程完全相同。这表明预训练阶段的价值取向会传递到奖励模型，开发者选择基础模型时需考虑价值对齐而不仅是性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型对LLM与人类价值观对齐至关重要，但相比预训练和后训练LLM本身受到的关注较少。由于奖励模型从LLM初始化，它们会继承影响行为的表征，但这种影响的性质和程度仍未被充分研究。需要理解基础模型选择如何影响奖励模型的价值取向。

Method: 对10个主流开源权重奖励模型进行综合研究，使用验证过的心理语言学语料库，基于"两大"心理轴(能动性/共情性)分析。通过追踪指令微调和预训练模型的logits，将log概率差异公式化为隐式奖励模型，并推导可用的隐式奖励分数。进行消融实验检验偏好数据来源和数量的影响。

Result: 奖励模型在人类价值维度上表现出显著的基模型依赖性：Llama系列对"能动性"有稳健偏好，Gemma系列对"共情性"有稳健偏好。该现象在偏好数据和微调过程完全相同时依然存在，可追溯到预训练模型的logits差异。隐式奖励分数展现出相同的能动性/共情性差异，且消融实验证明该效应具有可重复性和惊人耐久性。

Conclusion: 尽管奖励模型旨在代表人类偏好，但其输出明显受基础预训练LLM影响。这强调了在预训练阶段进行安全和价值对齐的重要性，并明确开源开发者在选择基础模型时，价值考量应与性能考量同等重要。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values but have received less attention than pre-trained and post-trained LLMs themselves. Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the "Big Two" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for "agency" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for "communion." This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance.

Motivation: Diffusion Map作为非线性流形学习方法在多个学科广泛应用，但其数据预处理、参数设置和主成分选择对结果的影响尚未在文献中得到充分讨论。

Method: 提供实践导向的Diffusion Map技术综述，通过案例说明常见陷阱，并展示一种新近引入的最相关主成分识别技术。

Result: 研究表明，Diffusion Map的前几个主成分并不必然是最相关的成分。

Conclusion: 强调了合理选择主成分的重要性，提醒实践者不应依赖默认假设，而应采用专门技术识别真正相关的成分。

Abstract: Diffusion Map is a spectral dimensionality reduction technique which is able to uncover nonlinear submanifolds in high-dimensional data. And, it is increasingly applied across a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as biology, engineering, and social sciences. But data preprocessing, parameter settings and component selection have a significant influence on the resulting manifold, something which has not been comprehensively discussed in the literature so far. We provide a practice oriented review of the Diffusion Map technique, illustrate pitfalls and showcase a recently introduced technique for identifying the most relevant components. Our results show that the first components are not necessarily the most relevant ones.

*Zihao Wang,Hang Yin,Lihui Liu,Hanghang Tong,Yangqiu Song,Ginny Wong,Simon See*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the minimum dimension needed to embed subset membership relationships into vector spaces (MED), finding logarithmic bounds and showing that retrieval limitations stem from learnability rather than geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fundamental geometric constraints of embedding subset memberships is crucial for designing efficient vector retrieval systems, as it determines the theoretical limits of what can be learned.

Method: The authors derive theoretical tight bounds for MED under various distance metrics (ℓ₂, inner product, cosine similarity) and conduct empirical simulations where subset embeddings are represented as centroids of their constituent elements.

Result: They establish tight theoretical bounds for MED and demonstrate through simulation that a logarithmic relationship exists between embedding dimension and the number of elements, achieving this in practical settings.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that limitations in embedding-based retrieval systems are primarily due to learnability challenges rather than geometric constraints, which should guide future algorithm design toward addressing the learning aspects.

Abstract: This paper studies the minimal dimension required to embed subset memberships ($m$ elements and ${m\choose k}$ subsets of at most $k$ elements) into vector spaces, denoted as Minimal Embeddable Dimension (MED). The tight bounds of MED are derived theoretically and supported empirically for various notions of "distances" or "similarities," including the $\ell_2$ metric, inner product, and cosine similarity. In addition, we conduct numerical simulation in a more achievable setting, where the ${m\choose k}$ subset embeddings are chosen as the centroid of the embeddings of the contained elements. Our simulation easily realizes a logarithmic dependency between the MED and the number of elements to embed. These findings imply that embedding-based retrieval limitations stem primarily from learnability challenges, not geometric constraints, guiding future algorithm design.

TL;DR: TimeCatcher: A novel volatility-aware variational forecasting framework that improves long-term time series forecasting for non-stationary data with abrupt fluctuations by using a variational encoder and volatility-aware enhancement mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight MLP-based time series forecasting models rely on local stationarity assumptions, causing errors in long-term forecasting of highly non-stationary series with abrupt fluctuations, a common challenge in domains like web traffic monitoring.

Method: Extends linear architectures with a variational encoder to capture latent dynamic patterns in historical data, and a volatility-aware enhancement mechanism to detect and amplify significant local variations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on nine real-world datasets (traffic, financial, energy, weather), with particularly large improvements in long-term forecasting scenarios characterized by high volatility and sudden fluctuations.

Conclusion: The TimeCatcher framework effectively addresses non-stationarity challenges in time series forecasting, demonstrating superior performance for long-term predictions with abrupt fluctuations.

Abstract: Recent lightweight MLP-based models have achieved strong performance in time series forecasting by capturing stable trends and seasonal patterns. However, their effectiveness hinges on an implicit assumption of local stationarity assumption, making them prone to errors in long-term forecasting of highly non-stationary series, especially when abrupt fluctuations occur, a common challenge in domains like web traffic monitoring. To overcome this limitation, we propose TimeCatcher, a novel Volatility-Aware Variational Forecasting framework. TimeCatcher extends linear architectures with a variational encoder to capture latent dynamic patterns hidden in historical data and a volatility-aware enhancement mechanism to detect and amplify significant local variations. Experiments on nine real-world datasets from traffic, financial, energy, and weather domains show that TimeCatcher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with particularly large improvements in long-term forecasting scenarios characterized by high volatility and sudden fluctuations.

TL;DR: Cofair是一个单次训练框架，通过公平性条件适配器实现推荐系统的训练后公平性控制，无需重新训练即可获得有竞争力的公平性-准确率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性感知推荐系统通常在训练时固定公平性要求，缺乏训练后灵活性；而实际应用中不同利益相关者的公平性需求会随时间变化，重新训练成本过高。

Method: 提出Cofair框架，引入共享表示层与公平性条件适配器模块，为不同公平性级别生成专用用户嵌入，并添加用户级正则化项确保用户级单调公平性提升，理论证明其对抗目标界定人口统计奇偶性。

Result: 在多数据集和骨干模型上的全面实验表明，Cofair提供不同级别的动态公平性，其公平性-准确率曲线与最先进基线相当或更优，且无需为每个新公平性需求重新训练。

Conclusion: Cofair成功实现了推荐系统的单次训练、多次调用的灵活公平性控制，解决了现有方法静态公平性约束的局限性。

Abstract: Despite growing efforts to mitigate unfairness in recommender systems, existing fairness-aware methods typically fix the fairness requirement at training time and provide limited post-training flexibility. However, in real-world scenarios, diverse stakeholders may demand differing fairness requirements over time, so retraining for different fairness requirements becomes prohibitive. To address this limitation, we propose Cofair, a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation. Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that our framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, delivering comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need to retrain for each new fairness requirement. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/weixinchen98/Cofair.

Method: 作者在OpenML CC18套件的57个数据集上进行了实验，研究了将Transformer集成到VAE不同组件的影响。

Result: 1. 将Transformer定位在利用潜在表示和decoder表示时会导致保真度与多样性之间的权衡。2. 所有组件中连续Transformer块之间具有高度相似性。3. 特别是在decoder中，Transformer的输入与输出关系近似线性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer与VAE结合的架构洞见，表明注意力机制可以建模特征交互，但表现出线性行为和性能权衡。

Abstract: Tabular data remains a challenging domain for generative models. In particular, the standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, typically composed of multilayer perceptrons, struggles to model relationships between features, especially when handling mixed data types. In contrast, Transformers, through their attention mechanism, are better suited for capturing complex feature interactions. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of integrating Transformers into different components of a VAE. We conduct experiments on 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite and draw two main conclusions. First, results indicate that positioning Transformers to leverage latent and decoder representations leads to a trade-off between fidelity and diversity. Second, we observe a high similarity between consecutive blocks of a Transformer in all components. In particular, in the decoder, the relationship between the input and output of a Transformer is approximately linear.

Motivation: 当前AI系统缺乏部署后持续学习的能力，而梯度算法内存开销大。进化策略作为无梯度替代方案虽有前景，但其在持续学习中的遗忘特性尚未被充分研究。

Method: 对进化策略进行综合分析，重点评估其在不断增加更新步数时的遗忘曲线，并与GRPO对比。

Result: ES在数学推理任务上性能接近GRPO，但遗忘严重；ES更新比GRPO更新稀疏度低数个数量级，ℓ2范数高数个数量级，这解释了遗忘差异。

Conclusion: 梯度无关算法如ES存在显著的遗忘问题，需要未来研究解决此问题以实现有效的持续学习。

Abstract: One of the biggest missing capabilities in current AI systems is the ability to learn continuously after deployment. Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.

Motivation: High-dimensional neuroimaging data poses challenges for analyzing neurodegenerative diseases due to complex non-linear relationships; existing methods lack adaptability in aligning latent features with clinical progression markers.

Method: Proposed a semi-supervised Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework with a flexible similarity regularization term to align specific latent variables with dementia progression biomarkers or cognitive scores, using ADNI PET scan data.

Result: The supervised latent dimension successfully captured Alzheimer's-related metabolic patterns (hippocampal reduction, Default Mode/Central Executive Network alterations), while other latent variables encoded confounding factors (affine transformations, intensity variations).

Conclusion: The framework effectively extracts interpretable, disease-relevant neuroimaging patterns aligned with established biomarkers, providing an adaptable tool for studying neurodegenerative progression.

Abstract: High-dimensional neuroimaging data presents challenges for assessing neurodegenerative diseases due to complex non-linear relationships. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can encode scans into lower-dimensional latent spaces capturing disease-relevant features. We propose a semi-supervised VAE framework with a flexible similarity regularization term that aligns selected latent variables with clinical or biomarker measures of dementia progression. This allows adapting the similarity metric and supervised variables to specific goals or available data. We demonstrate the approach using PET scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), guiding the first latent dimension to align with a cognitive score. Using this supervised latent variable, we generate average reconstructions across levels of cognitive impairment. Voxel-wise GLM analysis reveals reduced metabolism in key regions, mainly the hippocampus, and within major Resting State Networks, particularly the Default Mode and Central Executive Networks. The remaining latent variables encode affine transformations and intensity variations, capturing confounds such as inter-subject variability and site effects. Our framework effectively extracts disease-related patterns aligned with established Alzheimer's biomarkers, offering an interpretable and adaptable tool for studying neurodegenerative progression.

Motivation: LLMs memorize sensitive/copyrighted data during pretraining, creating GDPR/EU AI Act compliance risks. Existing unlearning methods leak target data, degrade model performance, or require costly external reward models, necessitating efficient, verifiable forgetting.

Method: PURGE (Policy Unlearning through Relative Group Erasure) frames unlearning as a verifiable problem using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It employs an intrinsic reward signal that penalizes mentions of forbidden concepts, eliminating external reward models.

Result: 46x reduction in token usage per target vs SotA; 5.48% fluency improvement; 12.02% robustness improvement; 11% unlearning effectiveness with 98% utility preservation on RWKU benchmark.

Conclusion: Formulating LLM unlearning as a verifiable task enables reliable, efficient, and scalable forgetting with theoretical guarantees, improved safety, and practical deployment efficiency, offering a promising research direction.

Abstract: During pretraining, LLMs inadvertently memorize sensitive or copyrighted data, posing significant compliance challenges under legal frameworks like the GDPR and the EU AI Act. Fulfilling these mandates demands techniques that can remove information from a deployed model without retraining from scratch. Existing unlearning approaches attempt to address this need, but often leak the very data they aim to erase, sacrifice fluency and robustness, or depend on costly external reward models. We introduce PURGE (Policy Unlearning through Relative Group Erasure), a novel method grounded in the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework that formulates unlearning as a verifiable problem. PURGE uses an intrinsic reward signal that penalizes any mention of forbidden concepts, allowing safe and consistent unlearning. Our approach reduces token usage per target by up to a factor of 46 compared with SotA methods, while improving fluency by 5.48 percent and adversarial robustness by 12.02 percent over the base model. On the Real World Knowledge Unlearning (RWKU) benchmark, PURGE achieves 11 percent unlearning effectiveness while preserving 98 percent of original utility. PURGE shows that framing LLM unlearning as a verifiable task, enables more reliable, efficient, and scalable forgetting, suggesting a promising new direction for unlearning research that combines theoretical guarantees, improved safety, and practical deployment efficiency.

Motivation: Secure low-altitude UAV operations are increasingly important for civilian and industrial applications, but accurately classifying UAVs in authorized versus restricted airspaces remains challenging in dense mmWave environments due to complex signal propagation and variability, requiring advanced classification models.

Conclusion: The CoBA model shows strong potential for reliable and regulated UAV airspace monitoring, offering an effective solution for secure low-altitude UAV operations in dense mmWave environments.

Abstract: Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in civilian and industrial applications, making secure low-altitude operations crucial. In dense mmWave environments, accurately classifying low-altitude UAVs as either inside authorized or restricted airspaces remains challenging, requiring models that handle complex propagation and signal variability. This paper proposes a deep learning model, referred to as CoBA, which stands for integrated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Attention which leverages Fifth Generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio measurements to classify UAV operations in authorized and restricted airspaces at low altitude. The proposed CoBA model integrates convolutional, bidirectional recurrent, and attention layers to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in UAV radio measurements. To validate the model, a dedicated dataset is collected using the 5G mmWave network at TalTech, with controlled low altitude UAV flights in authorized and restricted scenarios. The model is evaluated against conventional ML models and a fingerprinting-based benchmark. Experimental results show that CoBA achieves superior accuracy, significantly outperforming all baseline models and demonstrating its potential for reliable and regulated UAV airspace monitoring.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ACFormer, a novel architecture that combines linear projection efficiency with convolutional non-linear feature extraction to improve time series forecasting, addressing linear models' limitations in capturing high-frequency components while maintaining robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting struggles with modeling complex intra-channel temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations. Linear architectures are efficient for global trends but perform poorly on non-linear signals, creating a performance gap that needs bridging.

Method: The authors conducted systematic receptive field analysis of CNN-based forecasting models, introducing the "individual receptive field" concept. Based on findings that convolutions act as robust channel-wise feature extractors, they designed ACFormer with three components: shared compression module for fine-grained information, gated attention for temporal locality, and independent patch expansion for variable-specific pattern reconstruction.

Result: ACFormer achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, effectively mitigating linear models' drawbacks in capturing high-frequency components while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: ACFormer successfully reconciles the efficiency of linear projections with the non-linear feature-extraction power of convolutions, demonstrating superior robustness and performance for complex time series forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) faces challenges in modeling complex intra-channel temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations. Although recent research has highlighted the efficiency of linear architectures in capturing global trends, these models often struggle with non-linear signals. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic receptive field analysis of convolutional neural network (CNN) TSF models. We introduce the "individual receptive field" to uncover granular structural dependencies, revealing that convolutional layers act as feature extractors that mirror channel-wise attention while exhibiting superior robustness to non-linear fluctuations. Based on these insights, we propose ACFormer, an architecture designed to reconcile the efficiency of linear projections with the non-linear feature-extraction power of convolutions. ACFormer captures fine-grained information through a shared compression module, preserves temporal locality via gated attention, and reconstructs variable-specific temporal patterns using an independent patch expansion layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACFormer consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively mitigating the inherent drawbacks of linear models in capturing high-frequency components.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first foundation model for virtual sensors that overcomes limitations of existing approaches (application-specific models with hand-selected inputs and computationally expensive time series foundation models). The unified model simultaneously predicts diverse virtual sensors efficiently, learns relevant inputs automatically, and achieves 415x computation and 951x memory reduction while maintaining or improving prediction quality on large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual sensor approaches require application-specific models with hand-selected inputs for each sensor, cannot leverage task synergies, and lack consistent benchmarks. Meanwhile, emerging time series foundation models are computationally expensive and limited to predicting their input signals, making them incompatible with virtual sensors. There is a need for a unified, efficient foundation model for virtual sensors.

Method: The authors propose the first foundation model architecture for virtual sensors. This unified model can simultaneously predict diverse virtual sensors by exploiting synergies between tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. It automatically learns relevant input signals for each virtual sensor, eliminating the need for expert knowledge while providing explainability.

Result: In large-scale evaluation on a standard benchmark and an application-specific dataset with over 18 billion samples, the architecture achieves 415x reduction in computation time and 951x reduction in memory requirements compared to baselines, while maintaining or improving predictive quality. The model scales gracefully to hundreds of virtual sensors with nearly constant parameter count.

Conclusion: The proposed foundation model successfully addresses key limitations in virtual sensor technology by providing a unified, efficient, and scalable solution that dramatically reduces computational and memory requirements while maintaining or improving prediction accuracy, enabling practical deployment in large-scale sensor networks.

Abstract: Virtual sensors use machine learning to predict target signals from available measurements, replacing expensive physical sensors in critical applications. Existing virtual sensor approaches require application-specific models with hand-selected inputs for each sensor, cannot leverage task synergies, and lack consistent benchmarks. At the same time, emerging time series foundation models are computationally expensive and limited to predicting their input signals, making them incompatible with virtual sensors. We introduce the first foundation model for virtual sensors addressing both limitations. Our unified model can simultaneously predict diverse virtual sensors exploiting synergies while maintaining computational efficiency. It learns relevant input signals for each virtual sensor, eliminating expert knowledge requirements while adding explainability. In our large-scale evaluation on a standard benchmark and an application-specific dataset with over 18 billion samples, our architecture achieves 415x reduction in computation time and 951x reduction in memory requirements, while maintaining or even improving predictive quality compared to baselines. Our model scales gracefully to hundreds of virtual sensors with nearly constant parameter count, enabling practical deployment in large-scale sensor networks.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了神经常微分方程(NODEs)的外推能力和符号回归(SR)从噪声数据中恢复控制方程的潜力，发现NODEs可对新边界条件有效外推，SR能恢复大部分控制方程，二者结合为科学发现提供了新途径。

Motivation: 准确建模复杂系统动力学并发现其控制微分方程是加速科学发现的关键任务。

Method: 使用两个阻尼振荡系统的噪声合成数据，研究神经常微分方程(NODEs)的外推能力和符号回归(SR)恢复底层方程的能力。

Result: 1. NODEs可在新边界条件下有效外推，前提是结果轨迹与训练数据具有动力学相似性；2. SR能从噪声真实数据中成功恢复方程，但性能取决于输入变量的正确选择；3. 使用仅训练了完整模拟10%数据的NODE生成数据时，SR恢复了三个控制方程中的两个，并对第三个方程有良好近似。

Conclusion: 利用NODEs丰富有限数据并启用符号回归来推断物理定律，代表了科学发现的一种有前景的新方法。

Abstract: Accurately modelling the dynamics of complex systems and discovering their governing differential equations are critical tasks for accelerating scientific discovery. Using noisy, synthetic data from two damped oscillatory systems, we explore the extrapolation capabilities of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and the ability of Symbolic Regression (SR) to recover the underlying equations. Our study yields three key insights. First, we demonstrate that NODEs can extrapolate effectively to new boundary conditions, provided the resulting trajectories share dynamic similarity with the training data. Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables. Finally, we find that SR recovers two out of the three governing equations, along with a good approximation for the third, when using data generated by a NODE trained on just 10% of the full simulation. While this last finding highlights an area for future work, our results suggest that using NODEs to enrich limited data and enable symbolic regression to infer physical laws represents a promising new approach for scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 提出MuRAL-CPD，一种结合主动学习与小波多尺度分解的半监督变点检测方法，通过用户反馈优化参数，提升准确性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督变点检测方法缺乏任务适应性且无法利用用户知识，难以满足实际需求。

Method: 采用小波多尺度分解捕捉多时间尺度变化，并引入主动学习机制迭代优化超参数，结合用户反馈调整模型对"变化"的定义。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上验证有效，尤其在少监督场景下显著优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将模型检测逻辑与用户认知对齐，在提升精度的同时增强结果可解释性，为少监督变点检测提供新方案。

Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) is a critical task in time series analysis, aiming to identify moments when the underlying data-generating process shifts. Traditional CPD methods often rely on unsupervised techniques, which lack adaptability to task-specific definitions of change and cannot benefit from user knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose MuRAL-CPD, a novel semi-supervised method that integrates active learning into a multiresolution CPD algorithm. MuRAL-CPD leverages a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition to detect changes across multiple temporal scales and incorporates user feedback to iteratively optimize key hyperparameters. This interaction enables the model to align its notion of change with that of the user, improving both accuracy and interpretability. Our experimental results on several real-world datasets show the effectiveness of MuRAL-CPD against state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios where minimal supervision is available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A positive-unlabeled RL distillation method enabling on-premise small-model alignment without human annotations or reward models by using teacher anchor responses and student self-ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-premise deployment of small models is limited to supervised fine-tuning due to RL alignment's dependency on expensive human preference annotation or large-scale reward models, which are impractical for local settings.

Method: Proposes PU RL distillation that queries a teacher once per prompt for an anchor response, locally samples multiple student candidates, performs anchor-conditioned self-ranking to induce preferences, and enables local training via DPO or GRPO.

Result: Experiments show consistently strong performance under low-cost settings.

Conclusion: The method bridges the on-premise RL alignment gap by distilling teacher preference-optimization capability with theoretical guarantees of order-consistency and concentration on near-optimal candidates.

Abstract: Due to constraints on privacy, cost, and latency, on-premise deployment of small models is increasingly common. However, most practical pipelines stop at supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and fail to reach the reinforcement learning (RL) alignment stage. The main reason is that RL alignment typically requires either expensive human preference annotation or heavy reliance on high-quality reward models with large-scale API usage and ongoing engineering maintenance, both of which are ill-suited to on-premise settings. To bridge this gap, we propose a positive-unlabeled (PU) RL distillation method for on-premise small-model deployment. Without human-labeled preferences or a reward model, our method distills the teacher's preference-optimization capability from black-box generations into a locally trainable student. For each prompt, we query the teacher once to obtain an anchor response, locally sample multiple student candidates, and perform anchor-conditioned self-ranking to induce pairwise or listwise preferences, enabling a fully local training loop via direct preference optimization or group relative policy optimization. Theoretical analysis justifies that the induced preference signal by our method is order-consistent and concentrates on near-optimal candidates, supporting its stability for preference optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistently strong performance under a low-cost setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于最优传输的群体反事实解释方法，通过显式学习将任意群体实例映射到其反事实的传输映射，解决了现有方法泛化性差、依赖强模型假设和几何失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有群体反事实解释方法存在三大缺陷：1) 仅针对固定群体优化，无法泛化到新成员；2) 过度依赖线性等强模型假设以保证可解性；3) 对群体几何结构控制不足导致失真。

Method: 提出学习显式最优传输映射，将任意群体实例传输至其反事实实例，最小化群体总传输成本。针对线性分类器，通过数学优化推导群体反事实函数，识别其凸优化类型（QP/QCQP等）。

Result: 实验表明：1) 方法能准确泛化到新群体成员；2) 有效保持群体几何结构；3) 相比基线方法仅产生可忽略的额外传输成本；4) 即使无法利用模型线性性，仍显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法通过最优传输框架实现了群体反事实解释的泛化性与几何保真性，减少了对模型假设的依赖，为可解释AI提供了更鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Group counterfactual explanations find a set of counterfactual instances to explain a group of input instances contrastively. However, existing methods either (i) optimize counterfactuals only for a fixed group and do not generalize to new group members, (ii) strictly rely on strong model assumptions (e.g., linearity) for tractability or/and (iii) poorly control the counterfactual group geometry distortion. We instead learn an explicit optimal transport map that sends any group instance to its counterfactual without re-optimization, minimizing the group's total transport cost. This enables generalization with fewer parameters, making it easier to interpret the common actionable recourse. For linear classifiers, we prove that functions representing group counterfactuals are derived via mathematical optimization, identifying the underlying convex optimization type (QP, QCQP, ...). Experiments show that they accurately generalize, preserve group geometry and incur only negligible additional transport cost compared to baseline methods. If model linearity cannot be exploited, our approach also significantly outperforms the baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文针对外生MDP提出纯利用学习（PEL）算法，首次证明无需探索即可获得有限样本遗憾界，颠覆传统认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Exo-MDP中，不确定性完全来自与智能体动作无关的外生输入，常见于库存控制、能源存储等运筹学应用。尽管经验表明纯利用方法效果优异，但现有理论遗憾界均依赖探索或表格假设，理论与实践脱节。

Method: 提出PEL算法，并引入反事实轨迹和贝尔曼闭合特征传输两个新分析工具，使得贪婪策略无需乐观估计也能获得准确价值估计。针对大规模连续空间提出LSVI-PE线性近似方法。

Result: 表格情形下PEL达到O~(H²|Ξ|√K)遗憾界；连续空间中LSVI-PE的遗憾界在特征维度、外生状态空间和时域上呈多项式关系，且独立于内生状态和动作空间。实验显示PEL持续优于基线。

Conclusion: 该研究推翻"探索必需"的传统观点，证明在Exo-MDP中纯利用已足够，为相关应用提供了更简洁有效的理论保证。

Abstract: Exogenous MDPs (Exo-MDPs) capture sequential decision-making where uncertainty comes solely from exogenous inputs that evolve independently of the learner's actions. This structure is especially common in operations research applications such as inventory control, energy storage, and resource allocation, where exogenous randomness (e.g., demand, arrivals, or prices) drives system behavior. Despite decades of empirical evidence that greedy, exploitation-only methods work remarkably well in these settings, theory has lagged behind: all existing regret guarantees for Exo-MDPs rely on explicit exploration or tabular assumptions. We show that exploration is unnecessary. We propose Pure Exploitation Learning (PEL) and prove the first general finite-sample regret bounds for exploitation-only algorithms in Exo-MDPs. In the tabular case, PEL achieves $\widetilde{O}(H^2|Ξ|\sqrt{K})$. For large, continuous endogenous state spaces, we introduce LSVI-PE, a simple linear-approximation method whose regret is polynomial in the feature dimension, exogenous state space, and horizon, independent of the endogenous state and action spaces. Our analysis introduces two new tools: counterfactual trajectories and Bellman-closed feature transport, which together allow greedy policies to have accurate value estimates without optimism. Experiments on synthetic and resource-management tasks show that PEL consistently outperforming baselines. Overall, our results overturn the conventional wisdom that exploration is required, demonstrating that in Exo-MDPs, pure exploitation is enough.

*Melika Mobini,Vincent Holst,Floriano Tori,Andres Algaba,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-generated bibliographies mimic human citation structure closely but contain detectable semantic fingerprints, suggesting detection should target content rather than graph topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether reference lists generated by large language models (LLMs) can be distinguished from human-curated bibliographies, and identify the most effective detection signals.

Method: Built paired citation graphs (ground truth vs. GPT-4o-generated) for 10,000 papers (≈275k references) from SciSciNet, with field-matched random baselines. Compared structural features (degree/centrality/clustering) and 3072-D title/abstract embeddings using Random Forests (RF) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Replicated with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and multiple embedding models.

Result: Structure alone weakly separates LLM/human bibliographies (RF accuracy ≈0.60) but cleanly rejects random baselines (≈0.89–0.92). Embeddings significantly boost separability: RF with aggregated embeddings reaches ≈0.83 accuracy, while GNNs with embedding features achieve 93% accuracy. Replication with Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows similar patterns (RF accuracy ≈0.77).

Conclusion: LLM bibliographies replicate human citation topology effectively but leave detectable semantic traces in content. Detection and debiasing efforts should prioritize semantic signals over global graph structure.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to curate bibliographies, raising the question: are their reference lists distinguishable from human ones? We build paired citation graphs, ground truth and GPT-4o-generated (from parametric knowledge), for 10,000 focal papers ($\approx$ 275k references) from SciSciNet, and added a field-matched random baseline that preserves out-degree and field distributions while breaking latent structure. We compare (i) structure-only node features (degree/closeness/eigenvector centrality, clustering, edge count) with (ii) 3072-D title/abstract embeddings, using an RF on graph-level aggregates and Graph Neural Networks with node features. Structure alone barely separates GPT from ground truth (RF accuracy $\approx$ 0.60) despite cleanly rejecting the random baseline ($\approx$ 0.89--0.92). By contrast, embeddings sharply increase separability: RF on aggregated embeddings reaches $\approx$ 0.83, and GNNs with embedding node features achieve 93\% test accuracy on GPT vs.\ ground truth. We show the robustness of our findings by replicating the pipeline with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and with multiple embedding models (OpenAI and SPECTER), with RF separability for ground truth vs.\ Claude $\approx 0.77$ and clean rejection of the random baseline. Thus, LLM bibliographies, generated purely from parametric knowledge, closely mimic human citation topology, but leave detectable semantic fingerprints; detection and debiasing should target content signals rather than global graph structure.

TL;DR: 提出Cox-MT框架，通过深度半监督学习（Mean Teacher）利用未标记数据提升ANN-based Cox生存分析模型性能，在TCGA癌症预后预测中显著超越现有方法，且多模态融合效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANN-based Cox模型训练需要大量带时间-事件标记的数据，但此类标记数据获取困难、样本有限，制约了模型性能。需要利用丰富的未标记数据来突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 基于Mean Teacher框架开发单模态和多模态ANN-based Cox模型（Cox-MT），采用深度半监督学习方法，同时利用标记和未标记数据训练。应用于TCGA数据库的RNA-seq和病理切片图像数据预测多种癌症预后。

Result: 在四种癌症类型中，单模态Cox-MT显著优于现有Cox-nnet模型；随着未标记样本增加，模型性能显著提升；多模态Cox-MT相比单模态表现更佳。

Conclusion: Cox-MT模型能有效利用标记和未标记数据，显著提升预测准确性，为数据标记有限的生存分析任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model is widely used in survival analysis. Recently, artificial neural network (ANN)-based Cox-PH models have been developed. However, training these Cox models with high-dimensional features typically requires a substantial number of labeled samples containing information about time-to-event. The limited availability of labeled data for training often constrains the performance of ANN-based Cox models. To address this issue, we employed a deep semi-supervised learning (DSSL) approach to develop single- and multi-modal ANN-based Cox models based on the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, which utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data for training. We applied our model, named Cox-MT, to predict the prognosis of several types of cancer using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our single-modal Cox-MT models, utilizing TCGA RNA-seq data or whole slide images, significantly outperformed the existing ANN-based Cox model, Cox-nnet, using the same data set across four types of cancer considered. As the number of unlabeled samples increased, the performance of Cox-MT significantly improved with a given set of labeled data. Furthermore, our multi-modal Cox-MT model demonstrated considerably better performance than the single-modal model. In summary, the Cox-MT model effectively leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to significantly enhance prediction accuracy compared to existing ANN-based Cox models trained solely on labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有误差反馈(EF)压缩方法虽能降低联邦学习通信开销，但在非独立同分布数据下残差误差衰减缓慢，导致梯度失配和早期训练进度停滞，亟需一种既能快速启动又能保持长期稳定的通信高效算法。

Result: 理论证明SA-PEF在非凸Fed-SGD标准保证基础上达到O((η,η₀TR)⁻¹)收敛速率，揭示步长前向控制的残差收缩因子ρ_r是加速早期训练的关键机制。实验表明SA-PEF在多种架构和数据集上均比EF更快达到目标精度。

Conclusion: SA-PEF成功解决了联邦学习中non-IID数据下的早期训练瓶颈，通过理论指导的参数选择实现了快速收敛与稳定性的最佳平衡，为通信高效的分布式学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Biased gradient compression with error feedback (EF) reduces communication in federated learning (FL), but under non-IID data, the residual error can decay slowly, causing gradient mismatch and stalled progress in the early rounds. We propose step-ahead partial error feedback (SA-PEF), which integrates step-ahead (SA) correction with partial error feedback (PEF). SA-PEF recovers EF when the step-ahead coefficient $α=0$ and step-ahead EF (SAEF) when $α=1$. For non-convex objectives and $δ$-contractive compressors, we establish a second-moment bound and a residual recursion that guarantee convergence to stationarity under heterogeneous data and partial client participation. The resulting rates match standard non-convex Fed-SGD guarantees up to constant factors, achieving $O((η,η_0TR)^{-1})$ convergence to a variance/heterogeneity floor with a fixed inner step size. Our analysis reveals a step-ahead-controlled residual contraction $ρ_r$ that explains the observed acceleration in the early training phase. To balance SAEF's rapid warm-up with EF's long-term stability, we select $α$ near its theory-predicted optimum. Experiments across diverse architectures and datasets show that SA-PEF consistently reaches target accuracy faster than EF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the open problem of conditioning diffusion models (which provide expressive priors in function space) to sample from posterior distributions in Bayesian inverse problems arising from PDEs, where traditional methods are limited.

Method: Proving conditioning via infinite-dimensional Doob's h-transform under assumptions about the prior, decomposing the conditional score, and proposing Supervised Guidance Training - a simulation-free score matching objective for efficient and stable posterior sampling.

Result: The models can be theoretically conditioned, the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score plus a guidance term, and the proposed training method enables efficient and stable posterior sampling. This is the first function-space method for fine-tuning diffusion models for posterior sampling, validated with numerical examples.

Conclusion: The work provides the theoretical foundation and practical method for using diffusion models in function spaces for Bayesian inverse problems, enabling accurate posterior sampling through fine-tuning.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have recently been extended to infinite-dimensional function spaces, with uses such as inverse problems arising from partial differential equations. In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces. In summary, our work offers the first function-space method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models to accurately sample from a posterior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习面临分布偏移的根本挑战，当数据稀缺或由分布外(OOD)状态主导时，标准TD学习的平方误差目标会在OOD区域产生并放大有害的交叉协方差，导致优化偏差和策略性能下降。

Method: 提出两种互补方法：(1)分区缓冲采样(C^4)，限制更新在局部重放分区内，对齐更新方向以衰减不规则协方差效应；(2)显式梯度修正惩罚，在每个更新中抵消协方差诱导的偏差。

Result: 理论证明缓冲分区保持最大化目标的下界性质，约束能缓解极端OOD区域的过度保守性而不改变策略约束的核心行为。实验表明方法具有更高稳定性，在小型和OOD主导数据集上比基线方法回报提升高达30%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了离线RL中的分布偏移问题，通过抑制TD交叉协方差的负面影响，在保持算法核心行为的同时显著提升了性能，尤其适用于数据稀缺和OOD区域突出的场景。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in offline reinforcement learning is distributional shift. Scarce data or datasets dominated by out-of-distribution (OOD) areas exacerbate this issue. Our theoretical analysis and experiments show that the standard squared error objective induces a harmful TD cross covariance. This effect amplifies in OOD areas, biasing optimization and degrading policy learning. To counteract this mechanism, we develop two complementary strategies: partitioned buffer sampling that restricts updates to localized replay partitions, attenuates irregular covariance effects, and aligns update directions, yielding a scheme that is easy to integrate with existing implementations, namely Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD (C^4). We also introduce an explicit gradient-based corrective penalty that cancels the covariance induced bias within each update. We prove that buffer partitioning preserves the lower bound property of the maximization objective, and that these constraints mitigate excessive conservatism in extreme OOD areas without altering the core behavior of policy constrained offline reinforcement learning. Empirically, our method showcases higher stability and up to 30% improvement in returns over prior methods, especially with small datasets and splits that emphasize OOD areas.

Motivation: 边缘和嵌入式AI系统上的时间序列预测需要模型具有长期稳定性，因为自回归推理过程中预测误差会累积。传统的RNN和Transformer模型可能无法满足这一需求，需要一种能够在资源受限环境下保持长期预测稳定性的方法。

Conclusion: COMET-SG1为边缘和嵌入式AI应用中的稳定自回归预测提供了一种实用且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: COMET-SG1 is a lightweight, stability-oriented autoregressive regression model designed for time-series prediction on edge and embedded AI systems. Unlike recurrent neural networks or transformer-based sequence models, COMET-SG1 operates through linear behavior-space encoding, memory-anchored transition estimation, and deterministic state updates. This structure prioritizes bounded long-horizon behavior under fully autoregressive inference, a critical requirement for edge deployment where prediction errors accumulate over time. Experiments on non-stationary synthetic time-series data demonstrate that COMET-SG1 achieves competitive short-horizon accuracy while exhibiting significantly reduced long-horizon drift compared to MLP, LSTM, and k-nearest neighbor baselines. With a compact parameter footprint and operations compatible with fixed-point arithmetic, COMET-SG1 provides a practical and interpretable approach for stable autoregressive prediction in edge and embedded AI applications.

*Rubén Jiménez,Oriol Pujol*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a distance-based copying framework that replaces hard-label supervision with signed distances to teacher model decision boundaries, converting black-box model replication into a smooth regression problem that improves fidelity and generalization while enabling uncertainty signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployed ML systems need continuous evolution but often lack access to original training data or model internals. Black-box copying using hard-label outputs creates discontinuous surface reconstruction problems that limit efficient decision boundary recovery.

Method: Developed a distance-based distillation framework using signed distances to decision boundaries instead of hard labels. Introduced α-governed smoothing with Hölder/Lipschitz control over the target surface and two model-agnostic algorithms to estimate signed distances from label-only queries.

Result: Experiments on synthetic problems and UCI benchmarks showed consistent improvements in fidelity and generalization accuracy over hard-label baselines, with distance outputs providing uncertainty-related signals for black-box replicas.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical mechanism for upgrading legacy models by exploiting local geometry through smooth regression, overcoming the limitations of discontinuous hard-label copying in black-box settings.

Abstract: Deployed machine learning systems must continuously evolve as data, architectures, and regulations change, often without access to original training data or model internals. In such settings, black-box copying provides a practical refactoring mechanism, i.e. upgrading legacy models by learning replicas from input-output queries alone. When restricted to hard-label outputs, copying turns into a discontinuous surface reconstruction problem from pointwise queries, severely limiting the ability to recover boundary geometry efficiently. We propose a distance-based copying (distillation) framework that replaces hard-label supervision with signed distances to the teacher's decision boundary, converting copying into a smooth regression problem that exploits local geometry. We develop an $α$-governed smoothing and regularization scheme with Hölder/Lipschitz control over the induced target surface, and introduce two model-agnostic algorithms to estimate signed distances under label-only access. Experiments on synthetic problems and UCI benchmarks show consistent improvements in fidelity and generalization accuracy over hard-label baselines, while enabling distance outputs as uncertainty-related signals for black-box replicas.

Abstract: Multitask learning and related frameworks have achieved tremendous success in modern applications. In multitask learning problem, we are given a set of heterogeneous datasets collected from related source tasks and hope to enhance the performance above what we could hope to achieve by solving each of them individually. The recent work of arXiv:2006.15785 has showed that, without access to distributional information, no algorithm based on aggregating samples alone can guarantee optimal risk as long as the sample size per task is bounded.
  In this paper, we focus on understanding the statistical limits of multitask learning. We go beyond the no-free-lunch theorem in arXiv:2006.15785 by establishing a stronger impossibility result of adaptation that holds for arbitrarily large sample size per task. This improvement conveys an important message that the hardness of multitask learning cannot be overcame by having abundant data per task. We also discuss the notion of optimal adaptivity that may be of future interests.

Conclusion: 该工作深化了对决策树主动学习的理论理解，明确了结构假设的重要性，提供了具有紧致理论保证的算法框架，为后续研究奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: This paper advances the theoretical understanding of active learning label complexity for decision trees as binary classifiers. We make two main contributions. First, we provide the first analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees-a key parameter governing active learning label complexity. Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity. Second, we present the first general active learning algorithm for binary classification that achieves a multiplicative error guarantee, producing a $(1+ε)$-approximate classifier. By combining these results, we design an active learning algorithm for decision trees that uses only a polylogarithmic number of label queries in the dataset size, under the stated assumptions. Finally, we establish a label complexity lower bound, showing our algorithm's dependence on the error tolerance $ε$ is close to optimal.

Conclusion: PatchFormer证明了基于分块的自监督预训练范式在时间序列领域的有效性，为构建通用、高效、可扩展的时间序列基础模型提供了新思路，显著降低了下游任务的数据和计算成本。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental problem with applications in climate, energy, healthcare, and finance. Many existing approaches require domain-specific feature engineering and substantial labeled data for each task. We introduce PatchFormer, a patch-based time series foundation model that uses hierarchical masked reconstruction for self-supervised pretraining and lightweight adapters for efficient transfer. PatchFormer segments time series into patches and learns multiscale temporal representations with learnable aggregation across temporal scales. Pretraining uses masked patch reconstruction with dynamic masking and objectives that encourage both local accuracy and global consistency, followed by cross-domain knowledge distillation. Experiments on 24 benchmark datasets spanning weather, energy, traffic, finance, and healthcare demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot multi-horizon forecasting, reducing mean squared error by 27.3 percent relative to strong baselines while requiring 94 percent less task-specific training data. The model exhibits near log-linear scaling with more pretraining data up to 100 billion points and processes length-512 sequences 3.8x faster than full-sequence transformers.

### [169] [A Unified Symmetry Classification of Many-Body Localized Phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20532)
*Yucheng Wang*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: 提出基于局域运动积分( LIOMs )的静态多体局域化( MBL )对称性分类框架：阿贝尔对称性兼容稳定MBL并存在拓扑相，非阿贝尔对称性则破坏MBL稳定性，建立了完整的MBL相分类表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安德森局域化存在Altland-Zirnbauer十重对称性分类，但相互作用多体局域化(MBL)缺乏类似的对称性分类框架，亟需建立理解对称性对MBL约束的统一理论。

Method: 发展基于局域运动积分( LIOMs )代数的对称性判据：当且仅当对称性可在准局域LIOM代数中自洽表示（不强制产生广延简并或非局域算符混合）时，才与稳定MBL兼容。系统结合AZ对称性与额外点阵对称性构建分类表。

Result: 发现点阵阿贝尔对称性兼容稳定MBL并支持对称性保护拓扑MBL相；连续非阿贝尔对称性普遍破坏MBL稳定性。成功构建完整MBL相分类表，识别稳定/脆弱/非稳定类别，并提供代表性点阵实现方案。

Conclusion: 建立了理解对称性约束MBL的统一且物理透明的框架，为多体局域化相的分类和实现提供了理论基础，解决了长期存在的理论难题。

Abstract: Anderson localization admits a complete symmetry classification given by the Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) tenfold scheme, whereas an analogous framework for interacting many-body localization (MBL) has remained elusive. Here we develop a symmetry-based classification of static MBL phases formulated at the level of local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We show that a symmetry is compatible with stable MBL if and only if its action can be consistently represented within a quasi-local LIOM algebra, without enforcing extensive degeneracies or nonlocal operator mixing. This criterion sharply distinguishes symmetry classes: onsite Abelian symmetries are compatible with stable MBL and can host distinct symmetry-protected topological MBL phases, whereas continuous non-Abelian symmetries generically preclude stable MBL. By systematically combining AZ symmetries with additional onsite symmetries, we construct a complete classification table of MBL phases, identify stable, fragile, and unstable classes, and provide representative lattice realizations. Our results establish a unified and physically transparent framework for understanding symmetry constraints on MBL.

Abstract: Solving the quantum many-body ground state problem remains a central challenge in computational physics. In this context, the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) framework based on Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) has witnessed rapid development, establishing itself as a vital approach for investigating strongly correlated two-dimensional systems. However, standard PEPS-VMC algorithms predominantly rely on sequential local updates. This conventional approach often suffers from slow convergence and critical slowing down, particularly in the vicinity of phase transitions or within frustrated landscapes. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient autoregressive row-wise sampling algorithm for PEPS that enables direct, rejection-free sampling via single-layer contractions. By utilizing autoregressive single-layer row updates to generate collective, non-local configuration proposals, our method significantly reduces temporal correlations compared to local Metropolis moves. We benchmark the algorithm on the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the quantum spin glass. Our results demonstrate that the row-wise scheme effectively mitigates critical slowing down near the Ising critical point. Furthermore, in the rugged landscape of the quantum spin glass, it yields improved optimization stability and lower ground-state energies. These findings indicate that single-layer autoregressive row updates provide a flexible and robust improvement to local PEPS-VMC sampling and may serve as a basis for more advanced sampling schemes.

### [171] [Directionality and node heterogeneity reshape criticality in hypergraph percolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20726)
*Yunxue Sun,Xueming Liu,Ginestra Bianconi*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: This paper develops a message-passing and statistical mechanics framework for percolation in directed hypergraphs, revealing how directionality and node heterogeneity reshape critical properties with anomalous exponents that depend on network structure, validated on synthetic models and a real metabolic network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional network models cannot capture directional higher-order interactions with asymmetric dependencies. Understanding damage propagation in systems like metabolic networks requires a new theoretical framework that accounts for directionality and node heterogeneity in hypergraphs.

Method: The authors develop a message-passing and statistical mechanics framework for percolation in directed hypergraphs that explicitly incorporates directionality and node heterogeneity, analyzing critical properties and deriving anomalous critical exponents.

Result: The framework reveals that directionality and heterogeneity fundamentally affect percolation criticality, producing anomalous critical exponents that depend on whether node or hyperedge percolation is considered in heavy-tailed regimes. These predictions are validated on synthetic hypergraph models and a real directed metabolic network.

Conclusion: The work opens new perspectives for characterizing robustness and resilience of real-world directed, heterogeneous higher-order networks, demonstrating that structural features like directionality and heterogeneity are crucial for understanding failure propagation in complex systems.

Abstract: Directed and heterogeneous hypergraphs capture directional higher-order interactions with intrinsically asymmetric functional dependencies among nodes. As a result, damage to certain nodes can suppress entire hyperedges, whereas failure of others only weakens interactions. Metabolic reaction networks offer an intuitive example of such asymmetric dependencies. Here we develop a message-passing and statistical mechanics framework for percolation in directed hypergraphs that explicitly incorporates directionality and node heterogeneity. Remarkably, we show that these hypergraph features have a fundamental effect on the critical properties of hypergraph percolation, reshaping criticality in a way that depends on network structure. Specifically, we derive anomalous critical exponents that depend on whether node or hyperedge percolation is considered in maximally correlated, heavy-tailed regimes. These theoretical predictions are validated on synthetic hypergraph models and on a real directed metabolic network, opening new perspectives for the characterization of the robustness and resilience of real-world directed, heterogeneous higher-order networks.
