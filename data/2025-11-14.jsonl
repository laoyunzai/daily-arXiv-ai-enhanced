This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models."}

Here, we systematically investigate the quantum conductance corrections of spin-polarized 2DEGs formed at the interfaces between two insulating oxides, ferromagnetic EuTiO3 (ETO) films and (111)-oriented KTaO3 (KTO) substrates. The anomalous Hall effect and hysteretic magnetoresistance provide clear evidence for long-range ferromagnetic order in the 2DEGs, which could be attributed to interfacial Eu doping in combination with the magnetic proximity effect of the ETO layer. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry by ferromagnetism in the 2DEGs, and with the assistance of spin-orbit coupling effect, gives rise to a nontrivial Berry phase. This results in a competition between weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) in the quantum transport of Dirac-like fermions at the KTO (111) interfaces. Notably, this competitive behavior can be effectively tuned by optical gating via a photoexcitation-induced shift of the Fermi level.

Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $Δ$, on site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that render the underlying nature of random graph. By varying $p,$ $Δ$ and the disorder, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties.

I show that frustration is effective against Ohmic noise ($s=1$) and has some protection for $0.76<s<1$ sub-Ohmic noise.

The exponential of the free energy difference is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final marginal probability distribution of the open system. A trajectory counterpart of this relation follows from an asymptotic equilibration postulate, which treats relaxation to the final stationary canonical state as a boundary condition rather than as a consequence of constraints on the driven dynamics. In the frozen-coupling regime, the HMF shift reduces to the bare-system Hamiltonian shift, yielding a clear heat-work decomposition. The Jarzynski equality (JE) is recovered under the assumption of Hamiltonian dynamics for the combined system. We validate the theory on a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive followed by an underdamped Langevin relaxation, where the assumptions underlying the JE break down, whereas our equality reproduces the exact free energy differences."}

This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures."}

A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of the observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. Based on a generic kinetic model, we demonstrate that, along first-passage trajectories, entropy production remains constant when the changes in stochastic entropy and free energy of the machine are balanced, which corresponds to zero net hidden flux through the initial state manifold. Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize). In addition, using an enzymatic model, we show that the violation of our first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be thought of as a consequence of the breakdown of local detailed balance in the steps linking coarse-grained states that correspond to the initial and intermediate state manifolds. In the absence of hidden current, the fluctuation theorem is restored, and a mesoscopic local detailed balance condition can be established, which has implications for the thermodynamic analysis of driven, coarse-grained systems.

Here we experimentally achieve controllable vacuum-state freezing in programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms through many-body Stückelberg interference, with visibility exceeding $70\\%$ and excitation suppression to $1\\%$ despite periodic driving that would typically induce heating. Comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries, we show that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency dramatically enhances interference-driven freezing. Finite-range interaction tails play a decisive role, producing interference patterns which constrained $PXP$ models cannot capture.

Yet, most provable guarantees for quantum algorithms rely exclusively on Grover-type methods that cap the possible advantage at only quadratic speed-ups, making the search for approaches that surpass this quadratic barrier a key challenge. In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability. A problem we leave open is to establish a non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap as a function of the rotation angle. Resolving this directly translates into an improved worst-case runtime, potentially realizing a super-quadratic quantum advantage."}

The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly."}

By randomly choosing a protocol according to a probability distribution over a list of protocols for each pair we want to produce, we can achieve rates and fidelities not achieved by any of the original protocols. Here, we show how to choose this distribution to maximise the rate at which we produce qubit pairs with a given fidelity to a Bell state or, equivalently, to maximise the fidelity to a Bell state of the qubit pairs produced at a given rate. We investigate both the asymptotic case, where the number of initial pairs goes to infinity, and the finite-size regime, where protocols are restricted to a finite number of weakly entangled pairs."}

Here we experimentally achieve controllable vacuum-state freezing in programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms through many-body Stückelberg interference, with visibility exceeding $70\\%$ and excitation suppression to $1\\%$ despite periodic driving that would typically induce heating. Comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries, we show that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency dramatically enhances interference-driven freezing. Finite-range interaction tails play a decisive role, producing interference patterns which constrained $PXP$ models cannot capture.

In this work, instead of machine learning (ML) algorithms that improve the code performance through local transformations, we impose additional global symmetries, that are hard to discover through ML, and we perform an exhaustive search. Precisely, we focus on the hypergraph product of two cyclic codes, which we call CxC codes and we study C2 codes which are the product a cyclic code with itself and CxR codes which are the product of a cyclic codes with a repetition code. We discover C2 codes and CxR codes that significantly outperform previously optimized HGP codes, achieving better parameters and a logical error rate per logical qubit that is up to three orders of magnitude better. Moreover, some C2 codes achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a smaller qubit overhead than state-of-the-art LDPC codes such as the bivariate bicycle codes, at the price of a larger block length. Finally, leveraging the cyclic symmetry imposed on the codes, we design an efficient planar layout for the QCCD architecture, allowing for a trapped ion implementation of the syndrome extraction circuit in constant depth."}

For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase.

This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures."}

By integrating $N$-representability constraints and nuclear-norm regularization into the optimization, the method builds an $N$-representable 2-RDM that balances fidelity to the shadow measurements with energy minimization. This unified framework mitigates noise and sampling errors while enforcing physical consistency in the reconstructed states.

In standard QPF, the output state has a primary contribution from $r$ high-probability bit strings, where $r$ is the period. Measurement of this state, combined with continued fraction analysis, reveals the unknown period. Here, we explore a different approach to QPF, where the period is obtained from single-qubit quantities $-$ specifically, the set of one-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) $-$ rather than the output bit strings of the entire quantum circuit. Using state-vector simulations, we compute the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit for a generic periodic function. Analysis of these 1-RDMs as a function of period reveals distinctive patterns, which allows us to obtain the unknown period from the 1-RDMs using a numerical root-finding approach. Our results show that the 1-RDMs $-$ a set of $O(n)$ one-qubit marginals $-$ contain enough information to reconstruct the period, which is typically obtained by sampling the space of $O(2^n)$ bit strings.

Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers.

Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\\mathcal{O}\\left(T(\\log L + d r \\log K)\\right)$. The capability of the scheme is demonstrated by using it to simulate the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation.

Our comparison focuses on the $k$-body reduced density matrix ($k$-RDM) as well as two standard bosonic Hamiltonians. The first quantized mappings use less resources for off-diagonal terms of the $k$-RDM by a factor of $ \\sim N^k$, compared to the second quantized mappings. The number of gates for the first quantized binary mapping increases faster with $M$ compared to the other mappings. Nevertheless, a detailed numeric analysis reveals that the binary first quantized mapping still requires fewer gates than the binary and unary second quantized ones for realistic combinations of $N$ and $M$, while requiring exponentially fewer qubits than the unary mappings. Additionally, the number of CNOT and $R_z(φ)$ gates necessary to express the exponential of the Hamiltonian in the binary first quantized mapping is comparable to the (overall most efficient) unary first quantized one when $M = 2^n$ for both the Bose-Hubbard model and the harmonic trap with short-range interactions.

Here, we overcome these challenges by introducing a general formulation of quantum backflow applicable to arbitrary momentum distributions. The framework recovers the standard backflow limit for unidirectional states and identifies general backflow as probability flow exceeding that predicted by the particle's momentum distribution alone. We show that this excess can reach nearly 13%, surpassing the standard backflow bound by more than a factor of three.

Potentially high encoding rates and large distance relative to their block size make them appealing for practical suppression of noise in near-term quantum computers. In addition to increased qubit-connectivity requirements compared to more conventional topological quantum error correcting codes, qLDPC codes remain notoriously hard to compute with. In this work, we introduce a construction to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations on the recently introduced lift-connected surface (LCS) codes (Old et al. 2024). These codes can be implemented in a 3D-local architecture and achieve asymptotic scaling $[[n, \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3}), \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3})]]$. In particular, LCS codes realize favorable instances with small numbers of qubits: For the $[[15,3,3]]$ LCS code, we provide deterministic fault-tolerant (FT) circuits of the logical gate set $\\{\\overline{H}_i, \\overline{H}_i, \\overline{C_i X_j}\\}_{i,j \\in (0,1,2)}$ based on flag qubits.

In addition, by applying the Lévy-Khintchine representation theorem, we clarify when and how a dissipative dynamics can be realized using Hamiltonian twirling channels.

On one hand, by designing the non-Markovian coupling parameters between the waveguide and resonator, single or two-photon transport and the resulting photon blockade effect can be manipulated according to the output photonic states at the end of waveguide. This non-Markovian process can be evaluated by scattering matrices and second order correlation functions related to the distance between two coupled points.

With an additional eigenvalue-shifting technique, the improved complexity depends on the spectral range of the system instead of its spectral norm.

In this regime, the ability of quantum processors to scale in size and depth has become a crucial factor shaping their achievable performance. This study investigates how finite scalability influences resource requirements for simulating open-shell catalytic systems using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The analysis compares hardware archetypes distinguished by fidelity or operation speed under two representative scalability models. Finite scalability increases qubit and runtime demands yet leaves overall scaling behavior intact, with high-fidelity architectures requiring lower minimum scalability to solve equally sized problems. These effects are largely independent of the chosen scalability model. Extending this framework, we examine runtime competitiveness across hardware and code configurations, incorporating surface-code and quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)-based fault tolerance under finite scalability. The results identify operating regimes where high-fidelity architectures remain competitive despite slower gate speeds and show that LDPC codes further expand this regime by reducing space-time overhead. Together, these findings highlight the central role of scalability in quantifying performance and guiding the design of next-generation quantum hardware. Continued progress in scalable architectures will be essential for extending quantum computing to increasingly complex scientific and industrial applications."}

Through calculating their complex spectra, we find these models are subject to a gapless-gapped phase transition with dissipation rate if the transverse field is larger than a model-dependent value. Interestingly, the variation of the complex gap with the dissipation rate is not monotonous, instead it manifest oscillations before entering the gapped phase. By simulating their non-unitary evolution, we show that the entanglement entropy of the steady state would transition from a volume-law to an area-law scaling with the increase of the dissipation rate. Meanwhile, some unexpected results about the entanglement entropy appear in the volume-law phase. These unusual features of the complex gap and the steady-state entanglement can be attributed to level crossings between the maximal imagine level and other levels.

At intermediate times the sum lies strictly below the bound due to phase-space overlap in local mixtures, quantitatively accounting for entanglement growth as a redistribution of a finite, budgeted resource into shared correlations. We establish the result analytically for two bodies and corroborate it numerically in engineered state-transfer chains, where it reveals a coherence-enabled dark transport: the resource becomes locally invisible while being stored in multi-body coherences. The predicted trajectory of the summed local negativity provides a practical hardware metric: deviations from the ideal, budgeted curve diagnose decoherence and control error."}

However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \\(A\\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations."}

An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform. We describe a model for the creation of isolated pulses in which this Fourier transform falls as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency and find examples where this fraction is in the range 0.1 to 0.2. The probability distribution for large fluctuation has the same functional form and implies a significant probability for fluctuations very large compared to the variance."}

This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures."}

Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models."}

Lokhov"], "title": "Learning of Statistical Field Theories", "comment": null, "summary": "Recovering microscopic couplings directly from data provides a route to solving the inverse problem in statistical field theories, one that complements the traditional-often computationally intractable-forward approach of predicting observables from an action or Hamiltonian. Here, we propose an approach for the inverse problem that uniformly accommodates systems with discrete, continuous, and hybrid variables. We demonstrate accurate parameter recovery in several benchmark systems-including Wegner's Ising gauge theory, $φ^4$ theory, Schwinger and Sine-Gordon models, and mixed spin-gauge systems, and show how iterating the procedure under coarse-graining reconstructs full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows. This gives direct access to phase boundaries, fixed points, and emergent interactions without relying on perturbation theory. We also address a realistic setting where full gauge configurations may be unavailable, and reformulate learning algorithms for multiple field theories so that they are recovered directly using observables such as correlations from scattering data or quantum simulators. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in practical learning of field theories in strongly coupled regimes where analytical tools might fail."}

In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $Δ$, on site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that render the underlying nature of random graph. By varying $p,$ $Δ$ and the disorder, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show the competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations in the parameter regimes. Despite the presence of large disorder, the skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson driven localization."}
