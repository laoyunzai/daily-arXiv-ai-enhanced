*Hannes Karlsson,Johannes S. Hofmann,Alexander Wietek*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于Penrose-Onsager准则和双粒子约化密度矩阵(2RDM)的规范框架，用于无偏识别强关联电子体系中的超导态，包括常规和非常规超导体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强关联电子体系中，无需先验假设地识别超导态是一个核心挑战。

Method: 利用Penrose-Onsager准则，通过分析双粒子约化密度矩阵(2RDM)的谱特性来诊断库珀对凝聚。将2RDM投影到对称群的不可约表示上，以获得凝聚体的对称性和结构。在二维哈伯德模型上应用辅助场量子蒙特卡洛(AFQMC)和密度矩阵重整化群(DMRG)方法。

Conclusion: 基于2RDM的Penrose-Onsager框架是表征关联量子物质中超导序的广泛适用且无偏的工具。

Abstract: Identifying superconducting states of matter without prior assumptions is a central challenge in strongly correlated electron systems. We introduce a canonical framework for diagnosing the formation of Cooper pair condensates based on the Penrose-Onsager criterion, in which superconducting order is encoded in the spectral properties of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM). Within this formulation, the symmetry and structure of the condensate are obtained by projecting the 2RDM onto irreducible representations of the underlying symmetry group, enabling an unbiased identification of both conventional and exotic superconducting states. We demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach through applications to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using both auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For attractive interactions without a magnetic field, we reveal a clear finite-size scaling of the condensate fraction on square lattices of size up to $20\times 20$. The framework further provides direct access to the internal structure and extent of Cooper pairs, which we track across the BCS-BEC crossover. Moreover, it enables a clean diagnosis of the finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in a magnetic field. Finally, we apply the approach to a supersolid phase in the repulsive Hubbard model with an additional next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^\prime$, where a charge-density wave coexists with a superconductor. We confirm the fragmented nature of the condensate and uncover substantial pairing correlations in the triplet channel with $p$-wave spatial symmetry in addition to the dominant singlet $d$-wave pairing. Our results establish the 2RDM-based Penrose-Onsager framework as a broadly applicable and unbiased tool for characterizing superconducting order in correlated quantum matter.

*Huandong Chen,Hong Li,Yutao Li,He Zhao,Ming Lu,Kazuhiro Fujita,Abhay N. Pasupathy*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用SiO2/Si晶圆上刻蚀的亚微米级几何坐标标记作为拓扑导航图，实现扫描隧道显微镜（STM）对微型二维器件（如20×20 μm²石墨烯/h-BN器件）精确定位的方法，无需依赖光学视口或电容传感，且兼容标准STM设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有STM测量中，微型化二维器件（<20 μm）难以精确定位，传统方法依赖光学视口或电容传感，存在视野限制、设备兼容性问题，亟需一种无需硬件改造的可靠导航策略以研究新兴量子现象。

Method: 在SiO2/Si晶圆上刻蚀亚微米级几何坐标标记，作为器件集成基底和拓扑导航图；通过STM topographic成像识别标记并结合原位样品台校准，实现微型器件的无光学依赖定位。

Result: 成功在石墨烯/h-BN微型器件上验证方法：可靠定位器件并获取原子级分辨率拓扑图像及隧穿光谱，且无需修改STM硬件或偏离标准器件制备流程。

Conclusion: 该拓扑导航策略为STM定位微型器件提供了实用替代方案，显著提升二维量子材料研究的效率与可行性，具有广泛适用性和工艺兼容性。

Abstract: We report the design and fabrication of guiding patterns for topography-based searching of two-dimensional (2D) devices for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements. Sub-micron geometric coordinate markers were etched into SiO2/Si wafers, serving as both substrates for 2D device integration and guiding maps for sample navigation. Here, we used a monolayer graphene/h-BN device with an active area of smaller than 20 um x 20 um as a model system and demonstrated that the device could be reliably located in STM solely through topographic imaging of the guiding patterns and in situ stage calibration, without reliance on optical viewports or capacitive sensing. Atomically resolved topographic imaging and tunneling spectroscopy were also obtained. Our proposed navigation strategy is fully compatible with standard device fabrication procedures and requires no hardware modification to existing STM setups. As such, it offers a practical alternative for locating miniaturized devices in STM, shedding light on studying emerging quantum phenomena in 2D systems.

### [3] [Probing multipolar order in the candidate altermagnet MnF$_2$ through the elastocaloric effect under strain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19343)
*Rahel Ohlendorf,Luca Buiarelli,Hilary M. L. Noad,Andrew P. Mackenzie,Rafael M. Fernandes,Turan Birol,Jörg Schmalian,Elena Gati*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 本研究通过弹性卡热实验、自由能模型和第一性原理计算，在MnF₂中建立了d波反铁磁体临界点的热力学探测方法，为探索反铁磁量子临界性提供了新途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反铁磁体作为新型量子材料，其d波序参数与磁多极子对称性相同，但缺乏有效的热力学探测手段，亟需建立实验方法以研究其有限温度临界行为。

Method: 结合弹性卡热实验测量、自由能理论建模和MnF₂材料的第一性原理计算，验证磁场面与单轴应变耦合的热力学响应机制。

Result: 成功在MnF₂中观测到有限温度反铁磁临界点，证实弹性卡热效应可作为探测d波反铁磁体临界现象的有效热力学探针。

Conclusion: 该工作为d波材料及其他体系中的反铁磁量子临界性研究奠定了实验和理论基础，推动了新型量子物态的探索。

Abstract: Altermagnets break a combination of time-reversal and rotational symmetries without generating a net magnetization. As such, the order parameter of $d$-wave altermagnets has the same symmetry as magnetic multipoles, and couples to the product of a magnetic field and uniaxial strain. We combine elastocaloric experiments, free-energy modeling, and first-principles calculations on MnF$_2$ to establish a thermodynamic probe of the predicted finite-temperature altermagnetic critical point. These results pave the way to explore altermagnetic quantum criticality in $d$-wave materials and beyond.

### [4] [Coupled Majorana modes in a dual vortex of the Kitaev honeycomb model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19458)
*Surajit Basak,Jean-Noël Fuchs*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper analytically and numerically studies a dual vortex state in the Kitaev model: an isolated vortex-free plaquette binds a fermionic mode equivalent to two coupled Majorana zero modes, with coupling energy ε tunable by the three-spin interaction strength κ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the novel "dual vortex" state (a vortex-free plaquite) in the Kitaev model's vortex-full sector with time-reversal-breaking three-spin term (κ), contrasting it with conventional vortex-bound states in topological superconductors, and understand its Majorana mode structure and coupling.

Method: Combines analytical continuum approximation (computing Majorana wavefunctions and coupling ε in small/large κ limits) with numerical validation via lattice perturbation theory and full finite-size system numerics.

Result: The vortex-free plaquette acts as a dual vortex binding a finite-energy fermionic mode (ε) in the bulk gap. This mode is equivalent to two coupled Majorana zero modes on the same dual vortex. Analytical ε(κ) predictions match numerical results excellently. Results differ fundamentally from states bound to standard vortices in even-Chern-number topological superconductors.

Conclusion: The dual vortex in the Kitaev model hosts a unique bound state representing two coupled Majorana zero modes, with coupling strength ε controlled by κ. This reveals a distinct topological entity beyond conventional vortices, enriching the understanding of Majorana physics in exactly solvable models.

Abstract: The Kitaev model is exactly solvable in terms of Majorana fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice and coupled to a static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field, giving the possibility of $π$-vortices in hexagonal plaquettes. In the vortex-full sector and in the presence of a time-reversal-breaking three-spin term of strength $κ$, the energy spectrum is gapped and the ground state possesses an even Chern number. An isolated vortex-free plaquette acts as a ``dual vortex'' and binds a fermionic mode at finite energy $ε$ in the bulk gap. This mode is equivalent to two coupled Majorana zero modes located on the same dual vortex. In a continuum approximation, we analytically compute the Majorana wavefunctions and their coupling $ε$ in the two limits of small or large $κ$. The analytical approach is confirmed by numerical perturbation theory directly on the lattice. The latter is in excellent agreement with the full numerics on a finite-size system. We contrast our results with states bound to an isolated vortex in a topological superconductor with even Chern number.

### [5] [Realization of Wigner-Mott insulators in 6R-TaS$_2$ superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19482)
*Hongqin Xiao,Geng Li,Yuxuan He,Ke Zhu,Yuhan Ye,Yumeng Li,Lijing Huang,Haitao Yang,Ziqiang Wang,Hong-Jun Gao*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 首次在6R-TaS₂中利用扫描隧道显微镜观测到Wigner-Mott绝缘态，揭示了长程库仑相互作用对分数量子填充莫特局域化的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wigner-Mott绝缘态是强电子关联的典型表现，理论上需要原位和位间库仑相互作用的协同效应，但实验上一直缺乏直接证据。

Method: 使用扫描隧道显微镜(STM)在6R-TaS₂材料中局域注入电子，诱导不同的Star-of-David电荷有序超结构，系统研究绝缘相变。

Result: 观测到√3×√3超结构构成的Wigner-Mott绝缘态，具有显著的莫特能隙；对比发现整数填充的1×1莫特态主要由U主导，而分数填充态需要U和V的共同作用。

Conclusion: 首次在实验上直接证实了Wigner-Mott机制，为可控研究和实现此类关联电子态提供了实验平台。

Abstract: Wigner-Mott insulating states represent a paradigmatic manifestation of strong electronic correlations, in which long-range Coulomb interactions drive spontaneous charge ordering and enable Mott localization at fractional electronic fillings. Such states have been theoretically proposed to arise from the cooperative interplay between onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. However, experimental realization of a Wigner-Mott insulator has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a Wigner-Mott insulating states in 6R-TaS$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy. By locally injecting electrons into the depleted 1T layer, we induce distinct Star-of-David charge-ordered superstructures and realize a cascade of insulating phases. In particular, a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ superstructure constitutes a Wigner-Mott insulating state, characterized by a robust Mott gap despite fractional filling. Comparative measurements reveal that the conventional 1$\times$1 Mott state at integer filling is governed predominantly by onsite interaction U, whereas the $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ fractional-filling Mott state requires the cooperative effects of both U and long-range Coulomb interaction V. Our results provide not only the direct microscopic evidence for a Wigner-Mott mechanism, but also establish a platform for the controllable realization and investigation of Wigner-Mott insulating states.

### [6] [Real-Time Iteration Scheme for Dynamical Mean-Field Theory: A Framework for Near-Term Quantum Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19896)
*Chakradhar Rangi,Aadi Singh,Ka-Ming Tam*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 提出一种实时域迭代方案求解DMFT自洽方程，通过将杂质问题映射到一维链并采用时域拟合更新杂化函数，在保持量子计算兼容性的同时，成功捕捉了哈伯德模型的金属-绝缘体转变和详细谱特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DMFT方法在虚时或频域运算，而该方案直接在实时域操作，更适合近端量子计算硬件的有限希尔伯特空间和实时传播实现方式（如Trotter化或变分量子算法），同时克服了两点DMFT近似的局限性。

Method: 将有效杂质问题映射到具有少量浴场的有限一维链，通过精确对角化求解；通过时域拟合迭代更新杂化函数直至自洽，应用于半满哈伯德模型。

Result: 在较宽的相互作用强度范围内实现稳定收敛，成功捕获金属-绝缘体转变；即使时间分辨率和浴离散化有限，谱函数仍清晰展示了哈伯德带的出现和费米能级处谱权重的抑制。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算效率与量子计算平台兼容性的前提下，克服了两点DMFT近似的主要限制，能够提供详细的谱特征，为量子计算时代的强关联电子系统模拟提供了新途径。

Abstract: We present a time-domain iteration scheme for solving the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) self-consistent equations using retarded Green's functions in real time. Unlike conventional DMFT approaches that operate in imaginary time or frequency space, our scheme operates directly with real-time quantities. This makes it particularly suitable for near-term quantum computing hardware with limited Hilbert spaces, where real-time propagation can be efficiently implemented via Trotterization or variational quantum algorithms. We map the effective impurity problem to a finite one-dimensional chain with a small number of bath sites, solved via exact diagonalization as a proof-of-concept. The hybridization function is iteratively updated through time-domain fitting until self-consistency. We demonstrate stable convergence across a wide range of interaction strengths for the half-filled Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice, successfully capturing the metal-to-insulator transition. Despite using limited time resolution and a minimal bath discretization, the spectral functions clearly exhibit the emergence of Hubbard bands and the suppression of spectral weight at the Fermi level as interaction strength increases. This overcomes major limitations of two-site DMFT approximations by delivering detailed spectral features while preserving efficiency and compatibility with quantum computing platforms through real-time dynamics.

### [7] [Agentic Business Process Management Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18833)
*Marlon Dumas,Fredrik Milani,David Chapela-Campa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出基于生成式与智能体AI的Agentic业务流程管理系统（A-BPMS），通过过程挖掘技术实现从自动化到自主化的范式转移，支持人机协同到全自动的流程连续体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BPM历经多次自动化技术浪潮，但生成式与智能体AI开启了从"自动化"到"自主化"、从"设计驱动"到"数据驱动"管理的新变革，需构建支持全流程自主优化的新系统架构。

Method: 基于2025年AI for BPM研讨会主旨演讲，提出A-BPMS架构愿景：利用过程挖掘使智能体感知流程状态、推理改进机会并自主执行优化，打通"感知-推理-行动"闭环。

Result: 定义了A-BPMS的核心特征：集成自主性、推理与学习能力，支持从人工驱动到完全自主的流程连续体，重新划定流程自动化与治理的边界。

Conclusion: A-BPMS将推动BPM进入自主管理新纪元，通过人机协同的弹性流程范式，实现动态环境下的持续性能优化与治理模式重构。

Abstract: Since the early 90s, the evolution of the Business Process Management (BPM) discipline has been punctuated by successive waves of automation technologies. Some of these technologies enable the automation of individual tasks, while others focus on orchestrating the execution of end-to-end processes. The rise of Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening the way for another such wave. However, this wave is poised to be different because it shifts the focus from automation to autonomy and from design-driven management of business processes to data-driven management, leveraging process mining techniques. This position paper, based on a keynote talk at the 2025 Workshop on AI for BPM, outlines how process mining has laid the foundations on top of which agents can sense process states, reason about improvement opportunities, and act to maintain and optimize performance. The paper proposes an architectural vision for Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS): a new class of platforms that integrate autonomy, reasoning, and learning into process management and execution. The paper contends that such systems must support a continuum of processes, spanning from human-driven to fully autonomous, thus redefining the boundaries of process automation and governance.

### [8] [LLM Driven Design of Continuous Optimization Problems with Controllable High-level Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18846)
*Urban Skvorc,Niki van Stein,Moritz Seiler,Britta Grimme,Thomas Bäck,Heike Trautmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes LLaMEA, a framework that uses large language models in an evolutionary loop to generate diverse optimization benchmark problems with desired landscape characteristics, addressing the limited structural diversity of suites like BBOB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test suites for continuous black-box optimization lack sufficient structural diversity, hindering comprehensive benchmarking and algorithm analysis.

Method: The LLaMEA framework guides an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties (multimodality, separability, etc.). It scores candidates using ELA-based predictors within an evolutionary loop, employs ELA-space fitness-sharing to increase population diversity, and verifies results through basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing, and t-SNE visualization.

Result: The generated functions exhibit the intended structural traits, expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming unrelated clusters, and provide a diverse, interpretable set of benchmark problems.

Conclusion: The resulting library provides a broad, interpretable, and reproducible benchmark suite that enhances landscape analysis and enables better automated algorithm selection.

Abstract: Benchmarking in continuous black-box optimisation is hindered by the limited structural diversity of existing test suites such as BBOB. We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits. In addition, a t-SNE embedding shows that they expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster. The resulting library provides a broad, interpretable, and reproducible set of benchmark problems for landscape analysis and downstream tasks such as automated algorithm selection.

### [9] [Explainable Uncertainty Quantification for Wastewater Treatment Energy Prediction via Interval Type-2 Neuro-Fuzzy System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18897)
*Qusai Khaled,Bahjat Mallak,Uzay Kaymak,Laura Genga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出IT2-ANFIS模型用于污水处理厂能耗预测，通过模糊规则结构提供可解释的不确定性量化，在墨尔本水厂数据集上实现与一阶ANFIS相当的预测性能且方差显著降低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 污水处理厂消耗全球1-3%的电力，机器学习模型虽能提供点预测但缺乏可解释的不确定性量化，这对关键基础设施的风险感知决策至关重要

Method: 开发区间二型自适应神经模糊推理系统(IT2-ANFIS)，通过模糊规则结构生成可解释的预测区间，并从特征级、规则级和实例级三个层面分解不确定性

Result: 在墨尔本水务东部处理厂数据集上验证，预测性能与一阶ANFIS相当，训练运行方差显著降低，提供与运行条件和输入变量直接关联的可解释不确定性估计

Conclusion: IT2-ANFIS框架成功实现了污水处理厂能耗预测的可解释不确定性量化，将预测置信度与运行条件和输入变量直接关联，为关键基础设施提供风险感知决策支持

Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants consume 1-3% of global electricity, making accurate energy forecasting critical for operational optimization and sustainability. While machine learning models provide point predictions, they lack explainable uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision-making in safety-critical infrastructure. This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures. Unlike black-box probabilistic methods, the proposed framework decomposes uncertainty across three levels: feature-level, footprint of uncertainty identify which variables introduce ambiguity, rule-level analysis reveals confidence in local models, and instance-level intervals quantify overall prediction uncertainty. Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables.

### [10] [RIFT: Reordered Instruction Following Testbed To Evaluate Instruction Following in Singular Multistep Prompt Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18924)
*Andrew Jaffe,Noah Reicin,Jinho D. Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了大型语言模型在指令跟随任务中对顺序结构的敏感性，提出新测试框架RIFT，发现当指令顺序打乱时模型准确率最高下降72%，表明当前架构将指令跟随视为模式匹配而非推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试将任务复杂性与结构顺序混为一谈，难以单独评估提示拓扑结构对LLM性能的影响，而复杂工作流中常需非顺序指令执行。

Method: 开发RIFT（重排序指令跟随测试平台），使用改写后的《危险边缘》问答对，对比测试线性顺序提示与内容相同但需非顺序执行的跳跃提示在6个开源LLM上的表现。

Result: 跳跃提示条件下模型准确率较基线最高下降72%，约50%错误源于指令顺序违反和语义漂移，显示当前架构将指令跟随内化为顺序模式而非推理技能。

Conclusion: 结构敏感性是当前LLM架构的基础性限制，对需要非顺序控制流的应用（如工作流自动化、多智能体系统）有直接影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for complex workflows, yet their ability to maintain flow of instructions remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill. These results reveal structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation in current architectures, with direct implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow such as workflow automation and multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 针对程序验证中验证条件(VC)证明的瓶颈，论文首次创建NTP4VC多语言基准，基于Linux和Contiki-OS生成Isabelle/Lean/Rocq测试用例，评估发现LLM有潜力但挑战巨大，揭示未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序验证依赖定理证明，但VC自动证明是主要瓶颈。现有ATP无法处理困难VC，需大量人工。NTP在数学竞赛成功但VC应用未探索，缺乏专用基准。

Method: 提出NTP4VC，创建首个真实世界多语言VC基准。利用Why3/Frama-C从Linux/Contiki-OS生成Isabelle/Lean/Rocq语义等价测试用例，评估通用和微调的LLM。

Result: LLM在VC证明上显示潜力，但仍面临重大挑战，与程序验证需求差距显著。

Conclusion: 填补VC证明基准空白，揭示LLM局限性，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Theorem proving is fundamental to program verification, where the automated proof of Verification Conditions (VCs) remains a primary bottleneck. Real-world program verification frequently encounters hard VCs that existing Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) cannot prove, leading to a critical need for extensive manual proofs that burden practical application. While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC. Results indicate that although LLMs show promise in VC proving, significant challenges remain for program verification, highlighting a large gap and opportunity for future research.

TL;DR: This paper studies how LLMs behave strategically in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games, discovering that their strategies are sensitive to payoff incentives and linguistic context, with language sometimes mattering as much as model architecture, providing a framework for auditing LLM strategic behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs increasingly function as autonomous agents in interactive and multi-agent environments, understanding their strategic decision-making is crucial for ensuring safety, enabling effective coordination, and designing AI-driven social and economic systems.

Method: The researchers employed a payoff-scaled Prisoner's Dilemma game to isolate sensitivity to incentive strength, investigating how payoff magnitude and linguistic context influence LLM strategies. They trained supervised classifiers on canonical repeated-game strategies and applied them to LLM decisions to interpret behavioral patterns across different models and languages.

Result: The study revealed consistent behavioral patterns across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive conditional strategies and significant cross-linguistic divergence. LLM behavioral intentions showed systematic dependence on both model architecture and language, with linguistic framing effects sometimes matching or exceeding architectural differences.

Conclusion: The research provides a unified framework for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and identifies inherent cooperation biases, offering direct implications for AI governance and the design of multi-agent systems.

Abstract: As LLMs increasingly act as autonomous agents in interactive and multi-agent settings, understanding their strategic behavior is critical for safety, coordination, and AI-driven social and economic systems. We investigate how payoff magnitude and linguistic context shape LLM strategies in repeated social dilemmas, using a payoff-scaled Prisoner's Dilemma to isolate sensitivity to incentive strength. Across models and languages, we observe consistent behavioral patterns, including incentive-sensitive conditional strategies and cross-linguistic divergence. To interpret these dynamics, we train supervised classifiers on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to LLM decisions, revealing systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioral intentions, with linguistic framing sometimes matching or exceeding architectural effects. Our results provide a unified framework for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and highlight cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance and multi-agent system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D情感说话脸合成方法存在两大挑战：1）音频-视觉情感对齐不佳，表现为难以从音频中提取情感且无法精确控制情感微表情；2）采用"一刀切"的多视角融合策略，忽视不确定性和特征质量差异，导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 提出UA-3DTalk框架，包含三个核心模块：先验提取模块将音频解耦为内容同步特征和个人化互补特征；情感蒸馏模块采用多模态注意力加权融合和4D高斯编码与多分辨率码本，实现细粒度情感提取和微表情控制；基于不确定性的形变模块通过不确定性块估计视角相关的偶然性和认知不确定性，实现自适应多视角融合，并采用多头解码器优化高斯原语。

Result: 在常规和情感数据集上的大量实验表明，UA-3DTalk在情感对齐的E-FID指标上超越DEGSTalk和EDTalk 5.2%，唇形同步的SyncC指标上提升3.1%，渲染质量的LPIPS指标上提升0.015。

Conclusion: UA-3DTalk通过情感先验蒸馏和不确定性感知机制，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了情感说话脸合成的情感对齐精度、唇形同步效果和视觉渲染质量，达到了当前最优性能。

Abstract: Emotional Talking Face synthesis is pivotal in multimedia and signal processing, yet existing 3D methods suffer from two critical challenges: poor audio-vision emotion alignment, manifested as difficult audio emotion extraction and inadequate control over emotional micro-expressions; and a one-size-fits-all multi-view fusion strategy that overlooks uncertainty and feature quality differences, undermining rendering quality. We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

*Weiran Guo,Bing Bo,Shaoxiang Wu,Jingsheng Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel adversarial training method using reinforcement learning to generate challenging queries for function-calling LLMs in a zero-sum game framework, improving their robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Function call capabilities are crucial for LLMs to interact with external tools, but existing finetuning methods using manually annotated or auto-generated data lack targeted design and are limited by fixed patterns, reducing their effectiveness in enhancing generalization and robustness.

Method: Proposes an adversarial data augmentation framework with a query model trained via reinforcement learning to generate targeted adversarial queries that challenge function call models, using a zero-sum game formulation with iterative alternating training between the two models.

Result: Advances development of more robust function call LLMs by systematically identifying and targeting model weaknesses, though specific quantitative results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: Provides a systematic approach to improve LLM tool interaction capabilities by adversarial training, enabling more robust and generalizable function call models.

Abstract: Function call capabilities have become crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to interact more effectively with external tools and APIs. Existing methods for improving the function call capabilities of LLMs rely on data obtained either through manual annotation or automated generation by models, and use this data to finetune the LLMs. However, these methods often lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns and data distributions, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing the generalization and robustness of function call LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method that employs reinforcement learning to systematically identify and target the weaknesses of function call LLMs. Our training framework introduces a query model trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adversarial queries that are specifically designed to challenge function call (FC) models. This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools.

TL;DR: 针对推荐系统中用户行为序列长度差异大导致短序列用户性能下降的问题，本文提出LAIN框架，通过显式引入序列长度作为条件信号，包含光谱长度编码器、长度条件提示和长度调制注意力三个轻量组件，在五个CTR模型上实现AUC提升1.15%，特别改善了短序列用户的准确性而不损失长序列效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统中用户行为序列存在显著长度异质性，从稀疏短期交互到丰富长期历史。现有CTR模型增加最大输入序列长度反而会因注意力极化和训练数据长度不平衡而损害短序列用户性能，亟需解决长度引起的偏差问题。

Method: 提出LAIN（Length-Adaptive Interest Network）即插即用框架，显式将序列长度作为条件信号。包含三个轻量组件：1）光谱长度编码器将长度映射为连续表示；2）长度条件提示向长短行为分支注入全局上下文线索；3）长度调制注意力根据序列长度自适应调整注意力锐度。

Result: 在三个真实基准数据集和五个强CTR骨干模型上的实验表明，LAIN持续提升整体性能，最高实现1.15% AUC增益和2.25% log损失降低。显著提高了短序列用户的准确率，同时不牺牲长序列效果。

Conclusion: LAIN提供了一个通用、高效且可部署的解决方案，有效缓解了序列推荐中的长度诱导偏差，平衡了长短序列用户的建模效果。

Abstract: User behavior sequences in modern recommendation systems exhibit significant length heterogeneity, ranging from sparse short-term interactions to rich long-term histories. While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction. Notably, our method significantly improves accuracy for short-sequence users without sacrificing longsequence effectiveness. Our work offers a general, efficient, and deployable solution to mitigate length-induced bias in sequential recommendation.

Motivation: 大语言模型在时间序列分析中表现出潜力但也存在脆弱性，特别是在数值保真度、模态干扰和跨模态整合方面存在困难。

Method: 提出TS-Debate框架，采用模态专业化协作的多智能体辩论机制：为文本上下文、视觉模式和数值信号分配专用专家智能体，通过结构化辩论协议协调交互，并引入验证-冲突-校准机制的审稿智能体进行程序化验证。

Conclusion: 该架构保持了模态保真度，暴露了冲突证据，无需任务特定微调即可缓解数值幻觉，为时间序列推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and time series (TS) analysis has revealed both promise and fragility. While LLMs can reason over temporal structure given carefully engineered context, they often struggle with numeric fidelity, modality interference, and principled cross-modal integration. We present TS-Debate, a modality-specialized, collaborative multi-agent debate framework for zero-shot time series reasoning. TS-Debate assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, preceded by explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates their interaction via a structured debate protocol. Reviewer agents evaluate agent claims using a verification-conflict-calibration mechanism, supported by lightweight code execution and numerical lookup for programmatic verification. This architecture preserves modality fidelity, exposes conflicting evidence, and mitigates numeric hallucinations without task-specific fine-tuning. Across 20 tasks spanning three public benchmarks, TS-Debate achieves consistent and significant performance improvements over strong baselines, including standard multimodal debate in which all agents observe all inputs.

Motivation: 现有图像地理定位方法将知识静态内化于模型中，导致开放世界场景下易出现事实幻觉和泛化瓶颈，且缺乏动态知识更新能力，难以完成假设-验证的推理循环。

Method: 设计分层定位智能体LocationAgent，采用RER架构（推理者-执行者-记录者）实现角色分离与上下文压缩以防止多步推理漂移；构建线索探索工具集进行外部地理证据验证；创建涵盖多粒度场景的中文城市定位基准CCL-Bench。

Conclusion: 将分层推理逻辑保留在模型内、验证过程卸载至外部工具的方法有效解决了地理定位中的幻觉与泛化问题，为开放世界场景下的动态知识推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Image geolocation aims to infer capture locations based on visual content. Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LocationAgent significantly outperforms existing methods by at least 30\% in zero-shot settings.

Method: 采用多智能体框架：图构建智能体生成初始图，模拟智能体诊断结构缺陷，语义智能体对齐文本语义与流程逻辑；通过自然语言反馈迭代优化

Result: 实验表明\model{}在结构正确性和逻辑一致性上显著优于强基线模型

Conclusion: 模块化设计使智能体能针对性修正错误类型，提供可解释可控的优化路径，为程序图提取提供新范式

Abstract: Automatically extracting workflows as procedural graphs from natural language is promising yet underexplored, demanding both structural validity and logical alignment. While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text. Important feedback is prioritized and expressed in natural language, which is injected into subsequent prompts, enabling interpretable and controllable refinement. This modular design allows agents to target distinct error types without supervision or parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate that \model{} achieves substantial improvements in both structural correctness and logical consistency over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出 CollectiveKV，一种跨用户 KV 共享机制，通过利用不同用户间 KV 序列的共享信息，将缓存压缩至原始大小的 0.8%，同时保持或提升序列推荐模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序列推荐模型面临 Transformer 注意力机制计算复杂度随序列长度增长带来的延迟挑战。KV 缓存虽能降低推理延迟，但会为拥有大量用户和长历史序列的系统带来巨大存储开销。观察到不同用户的 KV 序列存在显著相似性，表明其中存在可挖掘的协作信号

Method: 通过奇异值分解分析 KV，发现信息可分为大部分用户间可共享部分和小部分用户特定部分。设计可学习的全局 KV 池捕获共享信息，推理时每个用户从池中检索高维共享 KV 并与低维用户特定 KV 拼接，形成最终 KV

Result: 在五个序列推荐模型和三个数据集上的实验表明，该方法可将 KV 缓存压缩至原始大小的 0.8%，同时保持甚至提升模型性能

Conclusion: 跨用户 KV 共享是解决序列推荐系统存储开销的有效方法，证明了利用 KV 中的协作信号可实现显著压缩而不牺牲模型精度

Abstract: Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.

Result: 在17个MMTab基准测试（表格问答、事实核查、表格结构理解）上，相比MMTab训练基线分别提升+6.2%、+5.7%和+25.6%，同时生成透明可验证的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: CoReTab是一个稳健且可泛化的监督框架，能有效提升多模态表格理解中的多步推理能力。

Abstract: Existing datasets for multimodal table understanding, such as MMTab, primarily provide short factual answers without explicit multi-step reasoning supervision. Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile GUI agents fail when apps update their UI appearance and workflows, even though the underlying functional semantics and task intents remain stable.

Method: A dual-level memory framework (stationary memory for visual-to-semantic grounding, procedural memory for task intents) with dynamic memory evolution that prioritizes frequently accessed knowledge.

Result: Substantial improvements on AndroidWorld benchmark and consistent gains under distribution shifts in offline benchmarks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Leveraging stable structures across interface changes improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents powered by large foundation models enable autonomous task execution, but frequent updates altering UI appearance and reorganizing workflows cause agents trained on historical data to fail. Despite surface changes, functional semantics and task intents remain fundamentally stable. Building on this insight, we introduce MAGNET, a memory-driven adaptive agent framework with dual-level memory: stationary memory linking diverse visual features to stable functional semantics for robust action grounding and procedural memory capturing stable task intents across varying workflows. We propose a dynamic memory evolution mechanism that continuously refines both memories by prioritizing frequently accessed knowledge. Online benchmark AndroidWorld evaluations show substantial improvements over baselines, while offline benchmarks confirm consistent gains under distribution shifts. These results validate that leveraging stable structures across interface changes improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models have strong perceptual ability but their implicit reasoning is hard to explain and easily generates hallucinations on complex queries. Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task. Across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, MATA achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with monolithic and compositional baselines. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ControlNet/MATA.

Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆增强型LLM方法依赖外部评估或模型内省来建立记忆有效性，但这些假设在动态漂移的实际环境中往往失效。

Method: 提出Global Verifier (GLOVE)框架，引入"相对真理"概念，通过主动探测检索记忆与新观察之间的不一致性，实现无需真实标签监督的记忆-环境重新对齐。

Result: 在包含环境漂移的网页导航、规划和控制等多样化基准测试上，GLOVE显著提高了智能体的成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现能够自我进化的认知智能体提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Most existing memory-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) approaches implicitly assume that memory validity can be established either through external evaluators that provide task-specific success signals or through internal model cognition, such as reflection, for editing memory entries. However, these assumptions often break down in practical environments with dynamic drifts. We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth. Through active probing to detect inconsistencies between retrieved memories and fresh observations, GLOVE enables memory-environment realignment by verifying and updating memory without access to ground-truth supervision or strong reliance on model introspection. We evaluate GLOVE on diverse benchmarks spanning web navigation, planning, and control, augmented with controlled environmental drifts that introduce non-stationarity beyond the original benchmark settings. Our results show that GLOVE substantially improves agent success rates, suggesting a robust pathway to cognitive agents capable of self-evolving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes RPO (Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization), which reduces computational overhead in LLM reinforcement fine-tuning by generating only suffixes of reasoning paths instead of full trajectories, achieving up to 90% training time reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms for large language models require generating complete reasoning trajectories from scratch during the rollout phase, incurring significant computational overhead and inefficiency.

Method: The authors analyze the impact of different reasoning path segments on final correctness and propose RPO, a plug-and-play algorithm that trains models by generating partial reasoning suffixes using an experience cache rather than full trajectories.

Result: RPO reduces token generation during rollout by approximately 95%, cuts training time by 90% for 1.5B models and 72% for 7B models, and can be integrated with GRPO/DAPO to maintain comparable performance while accelerating training.

Conclusion: RPO effectively addresses computational inefficiency in reinforcement fine-tuning by leveraging partial reasoning optimization, offering a practical acceleration solution that preserves model performance.

Abstract: Within the domain of large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms necessitate the generation of a complete reasoning trajectory beginning from the input query, which incurs significant computational overhead during the rollout phase of training. To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 含硫废水处理对减少排放、降低腐蚀风险、实现水资源回用和降低运营成本至关重要。自动化处理过程可减少人员伤害风险。原油中的酸性成分（如硫化氢、二氧化碳）在处理过程中会释放到含硫废水中，若处理不当会造成严重环境威胁并加速管道设备腐蚀。

Conclusion: 所提出的模糊专家系统具有通用性，虽以含硫废水处理为例进行验证，但可推广应用于其他工业过程控制场景。

Abstract: Purifying sour water is essential for reducing emissions, minimizing corrosion risks, enabling the reuse of treated water in industrial or domestic applications, and ultimately lowering operational costs. Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose.

TL;DR: 该论文提出Omni-MATH-2，一个经过人工清洗和标注的数学数据集，揭示现有评估工具（如Omni-Judge）存在极高错误率（96.4%），无法有效区分模型能力，强调数据集质量和评估器可靠性对准确基准测试都至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型基准测试因数据集和评估方法的不准确性而效果不佳，亟需更可靠的评估工具来精确追踪模型进展。

Method: 人工审计Omni-MATH数据集，创建清洁的精确答案子集（4,181题）和标记的非标准子集（247题），确保LaTeX可编译性、可解性和可验证性，并对比GPT-5 mini与Omni-Judge，结合专家标注评估评估器可靠性。

Result: 修订后的数据集显著降低噪声，提供更精确评估；专家标注显示Omni-Judge在96.4%的评估分歧中是错误的；两个评估器均无法识别标记问题的失败模式；问题难度增加时，需要更可靠的评估器以避免掩盖模型真实差异。

Conclusion: 高质量数据集和可靠的评估器对于开发准确的模型性能基准都至关重要，当前评估工具存在严重缺陷，需要改进。

Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.

TL;DR: FuseSearch is a novel code localization agent that reduces redundant tool invocations by 34.9% through dynamic search breadth modulation, achieving SOTA performance (84.7% file-level F1) with 93.6% speedup and 68.9% fewer tokens on SWE-bench Verified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code localization agents suffer from 34.9% redundant invocation rates that negate parallelism benefits, creating a bottleneck in automated software development pipelines requiring joint quality-efficiency optimization.

Method: Proposes FuseSearch defining "tool efficiency" as unique information gain per invocation, using two-phase SFT+RL training to learn adaptive parallel strategies that dynamically modulate search breadth based on task context, transitioning from exploration to refinement.

Result: On SWE-bench Verified, FuseSearch-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance (84.7% file-level and 56.4% function-level F1 scores) with 93.6% speedup, utilizing 67.7% fewer turns and 68.9% fewer tokens.

Conclusion: Efficiency-aware training naturally improves localization quality by eliminating noisy redundant signals, enabling high-performance, cost-effective localization agents with dynamic search adaptation.

Abstract: Code localization constitutes a key bottleneck in automated software development pipelines. While concurrent tool execution can enhance discovery speed, current agents demonstrate a 34.9\% redundant invocation rate, which negates parallelism benefits. We propose \textbf{FuseSearch}, reformulating parallel code localization as a \textbf{joint quality-efficiency optimization} task. Through defining \textbf{tool efficiency} -- the ratio of unique information gain to invocation count -- we utilize a two-phase SFT and RL training approach for learning adaptive parallel strategies. Different from fixed-breadth approaches, FuseSearch dynamically modulates search breadth according to task context, evolving from exploration phases to refinement stages. Evaluated on SWE-bench Verified, FuseSearch-4B achieves SOTA-level performance (84.7\% file-level and 56.4\% function-level $F_1$ scores) with 93.6\% speedup, utilizing 67.7\% fewer turns and 68.9\% fewer tokens. Results indicate that efficiency-aware training naturally improves quality through eliminating noisy redundant signals, enabling high-performance cost-effective localization agents.

Abstract: Emerging 6G networks rely on complex cross-layer optimization, yet manually translating high-level intents into mathematical formulations remains a bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, monolithic approaches often lack sufficient domain grounding, constraint awareness, and verification capabilities. To address this, we present ComAgent, a multi-LLM agentic AI framework. ComAgent employs a closed-loop Perception-Planning-Action-Reflection cycle, coordinating specialized agents for literature search, coding, and scoring to autonomously generate solver-ready formulations and reproducible simulations. By iteratively decomposing problems and self-correcting errors, the framework effectively bridges the gap between user intent and execution. Evaluations demonstrate that ComAgent achieves expert-comparable performance in complex beamforming optimization and outperforms monolithic LLMs across diverse wireless tasks, highlighting its potential for automating design in emerging wireless networks.

Motivation: 传统A*搜索算法的启发式函数依赖人工设计，需要大量领域专业知识。随着大语言模型（LLM）和演化框架的发展，自动化启发式设计成为可能，但现有方法在通用性和性能上仍有提升空间。

Method: 提出算法上下文演化启发式（A-CEoH）框架，核心创新是引入领域无关的提示词增强策略：将A*算法代码直接嵌入提示词中，利用LLM的上下文学习能力自动生成启发式函数。通过演化算法优化提示词设计，并在UPMP和滑块拼图问题两个领域进行验证。

Result: 在UPMP和滑块拼图问题上的实验表明：1）A-CEoH生成的启发式函数质量显著优于基线方法；2）其性能甚至超过部分专家设计的启发式函数；3）验证了代码嵌入提示词策略对提升LLM生成启发式能力的有效性。

Conclusion: A-CEoH框架成功实现了启发式函数的自动化生成，证明了通过算法代码增强提示词的上下文学习方法能有效提升LLM在搜索算法设计中的表现，为树搜索算法的启发式设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Heuristic functions are essential to the performance of tree search algorithms such as A*, where their accuracy and efficiency directly impact search outcomes. Traditionally, such heuristics are handcrafted, requiring significant expertise. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary frameworks have opened the door to automating heuristic design. In this paper, we extend the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework to investigate the automated generation of guiding heuristics for A* search. We introduce a novel domain-agnostic prompt augmentation strategy that includes the A* code into the prompt to leverage in-context learning, named Algorithmic - Contextual EoH (A-CEoH). To evaluate the effectiveness of A-CeoH, we study two problem domains: the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem (UPMP), a niche problem from warehouse logistics, and the classical sliding puzzle problem (SPP). Our computational experiments show that A-CEoH can significantly improve the quality of the generated heuristics and even outperform expert-designed heuristics.

Abstract: With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.

Motivation: 现有基于激活的LLM安全监测方法在检测隐含有害行为时存在精度低、灵活性差和缺乏可解释性的问题。

Method: 将激活建模为细粒度、可解释的认知元素（CEs），构建基于CEs的谓词规则框架，实现实时违规检测。

Conclusion: 该范式使从业者无需重训练即可配置更新防护措施，支持透明度和可审计性，并将开源GAVEL框架及自动化规则创建工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly paired with activation-based monitoring to detect and prevent harmful behaviors that may not be apparent at the surface-text level. However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance. We will release GAVEL as an open-source framework and provide an accompanying automated rule creation tool.

TL;DR: CASTER is a lightweight router for dynamic model selection in graph-based multi-agent systems that uses dual signals (semantic embeddings + structural meta-features) to estimate task difficulty, reducing inference costs by up to 72.4% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based MAS suffer from inefficient static model allocation where uniformly deploying strong models wastes computation on trivial sub-tasks.

Method: Proposes a Dual-Signal Router combining semantic embeddings and structural meta-features for task difficulty estimation, trained via Cold Start to Iterative Evolution paradigm with on-policy negative feedback learning from routing failures.

Result: Across Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Scientific Discovery, and Cybersecurity domains, CASTER reduces inference cost by up to 72.4% while matching strong-model baselines' success rates, and outperforms heuristic routing and FrugalGPT.

Conclusion: CASTER enables efficient dynamic model selection in graph-based MAS, significantly reducing computational costs without sacrificing performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: Graph-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable complex cyclic workflows but suffer from inefficient static model allocation, where deploying strong models uniformly wastes computation on trivial sub-tasks. We propose CASTER (Context-Aware Strategy for Task Efficient Routing), a lightweight router for dynamic model selection in graph-based MAS. CASTER employs a Dual-Signal Router that combines semantic embeddings with structural meta-features to estimate task difficulty. During training, the router self-optimizes through a Cold Start to Iterative Evolution paradigm, learning from its own routing failures via on-policy negative feedback. Experiments using LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation across Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Scientific Discovery, and Cybersecurity demonstrate that CASTER reduces inference cost by up to 72.4% compared to strong-model baselines while matching their success rates, and consistently outperforms both heuristic routing and FrugalGPT across all domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges in healthcare recommender systems including lack of public clinical data, difficulty in understanding recommendations, associated risks, and uncertainty about effectiveness.

Method: A recommendation model leveraging psychometric data structure to provide faithful, interpretable visual explanations for care professionals, focused on gerontological primary care.

Result: Offline evaluation on Brazilian healthcare datasets and a user study on interpretability suggest the model can advance recommender system application in this healthcare niche.

Conclusion: The proposed model can assist professionals in creating personalized care plans and meet the growing demand, opportunities, and IT needs as demographic changes become more pronounced.

Abstract: There are challenges that must be overcome to make recommender systems useful in healthcare settings. The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates. The results suggest that the proposed model can advance the application of recommender systems in this healthcare niche, which is expected to grow in demand , opportunities, and information technology needs as demographic changes become more pronounced.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在数学等抽象领域通过语言思维链推理达到专家水平，但在物理和空间智能等需要丰富表征和先验知识的领域仍远落后于人类。统一多模态模型(UMMs)的出现引发了关于多模态推理的兴趣，但视觉生成何时及如何提升推理能力仍不明确。

Method: 从世界模型视角，理论形式化内部世界建模作为思维链推理的核心组件，分析不同世界模型的差异；实证研究方面，识别需要交错视觉-语言推理的任务，构建新评估套件VisWorld-Eval，并在先进UMMs上进行受控实验比较交错思维链与纯语言思维链的性能。

Result: 实验表明，对于适合视觉世界建模的任务（特别是物理世界任务），交错视觉-语言思维链推理显著优于纯语言思维链推理；但对于不适合视觉建模的任务，交错推理无明显优势。这支持了视觉优势假说。

Conclusion: 该工作明确了视觉生成在物理世界任务中作为世界模型的优势，以及纯语言推理在抽象领域的充分性，为构建更强大、类人的多模态AI推理系统提供了理论指导和实证依据。

Abstract: Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.

Conclusion: NavFormer成功解决了磁强计姿态变化导致的预测不稳定性问题，为自主导航提供了鲁棒的IGRF总强度预测方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Triad magnetometer components change with sensor attitude even when the IGRF total intensity target stays invariant. NavFormer forecasts this invariant target with rotation invariant scalar features and a Canonical SPD module that stabilizes the spectrum of window level second moments of the triads without sign discontinuities.

Abstract: This paper presents a Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) solution to the dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on Variational Quantum Circuits. The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

Conclusion: 超球面坐标参数化有效解决了高维VAE的潜在空间退化问题，为异常检测提供了更强大的表示学习框架，在真实世界复杂场景和标准基准上均验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods. For the unsupervised and OOD modalities, respectively, these are: i) detecting unusual landscape from the Mars Rover camera and unusual Galaxies from ground based imagery (complex, real world datasets); ii) standard benchmarks like Cifar10 and subsets of ImageNet as the in-distribution (ID) class.

TL;DR: 提出交互式基于投影的聚类框架IPBC，通过人机协作的非线性降维和约束反馈机制，将高维数据聚类转化为迭代式可视化分析过程，少量交互即可显著提升聚类质量并提供可解释性规则。

Motivation: 高维数据集普遍存在但难以有效聚类，传统降维技术生成静态2D/3D嵌入，缺乏可解释性且无法利用分析师直觉。距离度量在低维投影中效用递减，簇易塌陷重叠。

Method: IPBC框架整合非线性投影模块与反馈回路：用户可调整视角并提供"必连/不连"约束，动态重塑投影目标使相似点聚集、相异点分离；在优化的2D布局上运行传统聚类算法；最后通过可解释性组件将簇映射回原始特征空间，生成区分性规则或特征排序。

Result: 在多组基准数据集上的实验表明，仅需少量交互式细化步骤即可显著提升聚类质量。

Conclusion: IPBC将聚类转变为机器表征与人类洞察相互强化的协作式发现过程，实现了高维数据探索的有效人机协同。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets are increasingly common across scientific and industrial domains, yet they remain difficult to cluster effectively due to the diminishing usefulness of distance metrics and the tendency of clusters to collapse or overlap when projected into lower dimensions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.

TL;DR: 针对多通道时间序列数据通道异质性问题，提出通道感知损失函数（CP Loss），通过可学习通道滤波器构建任务导向的感知空间，替代传统统一损失函数以提升预测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测模型采用MSE等通道无关损失函数，无法捕捉通道特异性动态（如突变或趋势偏移），导致对异构多通道数据建模效果不佳

Method: 设计可学习的通道级滤波器分解信号为多尺度表征，构建通道自适应感知空间；联合优化滤波器与预测模型，使感知空间面向预测任务，并在该空间计算损失

Result: 通过通道定制化损失计算，有效捕捉各通道独特动态特征，提升异质多通道时间序列预测性能

Conclusion: CP Loss通过任务驱动的通道感知空间设计，解决了传统损失函数对通道异质性建模不足的问题，为多通道时序预测提供了新范式

Abstract: Multi-channel time-series data, prevalent across diverse applications, is characterized by significant heterogeneity in its different channels. However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task. Finally, losses are calculated within these perception spaces to optimize the model. Code is available at https://github.com/zyh16143998882/CP_Loss.

### [42] [How Much Temporal Modeling is Enough? A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18830)
*Alireza Jafari,Fatemeh Jafari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A systematic study comparing CNN with recurrent layers for ECG classification found that a single BiLSTM layer works best, while deeper stacked models yield diminishing returns and overfit, suggesting simpler architectures aligned with ECG signal structure are more effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label ECG classification faces challenges from coexisting cardiac conditions, class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies. While recent studies use increasingly complex stacked recurrent architectures, their clinical necessity hasn't been rigorously examined.

Method: Systematic comparative evaluation of CNNs combined with LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and stacked variants on the PTB-XL dataset (23 diagnostic categories). CNN served as morphology baseline while recurrent layers were progressively integrated to assess temporal modeling contribution.

Result: CNN with single BiLSTM layer achieved best performance: Hamming loss 0.0338, macro-AUPRC 0.4715, micro-F1 0.6979, subset accuracy 0.5723. Deeper stacked recurrent models showed diminishing returns, reduced precision, and overfitting despite occasional rare-class recall improvements.

Conclusion: Architectural alignment with ECG's intrinsic temporal structure, rather than increased recurrent depth, is crucial for robust performance and clinical deployment. Simple CNN+BiLSTM provides optimal trade-off between performance and complexity.

Abstract: Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩展测试时计算的方法在长思维链推理中存在计算成本与覆盖质量的基本权衡：要么训练开销高，要么产生冗余轨迹

Method: 在分块边界处，通过轻量级前瞻估计和软几何正则化对候选潜在锚点进行评分，鼓励轨迹平滑性与探索多样性；分块KV缓存重置使内存与分块长度呈线性关系

Result: 在数学和代码基准测试中，TGR将Qwen3-8B的稳健轨迹覆盖率（Pass@k曲线下面积）提升高达13个百分点，开销仅约1.1-1.3倍

Conclusion: TGR以无需训练、内存高效的方式解决了成本-覆盖权衡问题，显著提升了长思维链推理的轨迹质量

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute enhances long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between computational cost and coverage quality: either incurring high training expense or yielding redundant trajectories. We introduce The Geometric Reasoner (TGR), a training-free framework that performs manifold-informed latent foresight search under strict memory bounds. At each chunk boundary, TGR scores candidate latent anchors via a lightweight look-ahead estimate combined with soft geometric regularizers that encourage smooth trajectories and diverse exploration. Chunk-wise KV cache resets keep memory linear in chunk length. On challenging math and code benchmarks, TGR improves robust trajectory coverage, measured by the area under the Pass@$k$ curve (AUC), by up to 13 points on Qwen3-8B, with negligible overhead of about 1.1--1.3 times.

Conclusion: HaKAN为多变长时间序列预测提供了轻量级、可解释的通用解决方案，通过Hahn多项式激活函数有效捕获时序模式

Abstract: Recent Transformer- and MLP-based models have demonstrated strong performance in long-term time series forecasting, yet Transformers remain limited by their quadratic complexity and permutation-equivariant attention, while MLPs exhibit spectral bias. We propose HaKAN, a versatile model based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), leveraging Hahn polynomial-based learnable activation functions and providing a lightweight and interpretable alternative for multivariate time series forecasting. Our model integrates channel independence, patching, a stack of Hahn-KAN blocks with residual connections, and a bottleneck structure comprised of two fully connected layers. The Hahn-KAN block consists of inter- and intra-patch KAN layers to effectively capture both global and local temporal patterns. Extensive experiments on various forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its core components.

*Donghwan Lee,Hyukjun Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes foundational theoretical results for applying Bellman residual minimization to policy optimization in Markov decision processes, addressing a gap in the literature where this approach has been understudied compared to policy evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Bellman residual minimization offers advantages like more stable convergence with function approximation, it has received less attention than dynamic programming due to efficiency concerns and difficulties extending to model-free settings like reinforcement learning. Despite extensive study for policy evaluation, its application to policy optimization (control tasks) remains scarcely explored.

Method: The paper establishes foundational theoretical results for control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.

Result: The paper provides the theoretical groundwork for using Bellman residual minimization in control tasks, laying the foundation for future algorithmic development and analysis.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that Bellman residual minimization is a viable approach for policy optimization that merits further research, despite practical challenges.

Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored. In this paper, we establish foundational results for the control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准GNN在低同配性图上表现不佳，但同配性无法解释性能差异，标签信息量（相邻节点标签的互信息）能更准确地刻画图结构的有效性。

Method: 开发统一框架连接曲率引导重连与位置几何，实例化为ASEHybrid架构，采用Forman曲率和拉普拉斯位置编码。

Result: 理论证明GNN改进的充要条件，揭示曲率重塑信息流但不提升表达能力，给出重连过程的收敛性与Lipschitz稳定性保证；实验在多个数据集上验证了在标签信息丰富的异配性图上有效。

Conclusion: 图结构仅在包含节点特征之外的标签相关信息时才有价值，几何感知GNN能有效利用这类信息。

Abstract: Standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle on graphs with low homophily, yet homophily alone does not explain this behavior, as graphs with similar homophily levels can exhibit markedly different performance and some heterophilous graphs remain easy for vanilla GCNs. Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.

Abstract: Inventory planning for retail chains requires translating demand forecasts into ordering decisions, including asymmetric shortages and holding costs. The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns. In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs. Evaluated by the official competition simulation in six rounds, the solution achieved first place by combining a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy. Although developed for the VN2 setting, the proposed approach can be extended to real-world applications and additional operational constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种学习离散POMDP参数的新方法，通过张量分解从动作-观测序列中学习隐式状态转移和观测矩阵，解决了传统方法需要完全可观测或满秩转移矩阵的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主智能体需要学习与隐藏状态系统（如带隐藏锁的家具）进行交互。现有谱方法（如PSR）只能估计隐藏状态数量，无法直接获得转移和观测概率；而张量分解方法假设完全可观测和满秩转移矩阵，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 研究PSR如何通过张量方法学习转移和观测矩阵（至相似变换程度）。所提方法学习至状态划分的矩阵，其中同一划分内的状态具有相同的观测分布，且仅要求对应动作的转移矩阵满秩。

Result: 实验表明，在足够数据下，该方法学习的划分级转移模型性能与PSR相当，可用于标准采样式POMDP求解器。同时，显式的观测和转移似然可用于学习后规划器行为的指定。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统张量分解的假设限制，为部分可观测领域提供了更实用的参数学习方案，使学习到的模型能直接支持下游推理和规划任务。

Abstract: We are interested in enabling autonomous agents to learn and reason about systems with hidden states, such as furniture with hidden locking mechanisms. We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.

TL;DR: FSD-CAP是一个两阶段图特征补全框架，通过子图扩展、分数扩散和类感知传播，在99.5%缺失率下仍能实现高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据中节点特征缺失在高缺失率下极具挑战性，现有基于潜在表示或全局扩散的方法估计不可靠且会传播错误。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）图距离引导的子图扩展与分数扩散算子，局部化扩散过程并基于局部结构调节传播锐度；2）类感知传播，利用伪标签和邻域熵提升一致性。

Result: 在五个基准数据集99.5%特征缺失下，节点分类准确率达80.06-81.01%（接近完整特征的81.31%），链路预测AUC达91.65-92.41%（接近完整特征的95.06%），在大规模和异配数据集上优于其他模型。

Conclusion: FSD-CAP在极端稀疏条件下能有效补全特征，性能接近完整特征，并在各类数据集上展现优越性。

Abstract: Imputing missing node features in graphs is challenging, particularly under high missing rates. Existing methods based on latent representations or global diffusion often fail to produce reliable estimates, and may propagate errors across the graph. We propose FSD-CAP, a two-stage framework designed to improve imputation quality under extreme sparsity. In the first stage, a graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion localizes the diffusion process. A fractional diffusion operator adjusts propagation sharpness based on local structure. In the second stage, imputed features are refined using class-aware propagation, which incorporates pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy to promote consistency. We evaluated FSD-CAP on multiple datasets. With $99.5\%$ of features missing across five benchmark datasets, FSD-CAP achieves average accuracies of $80.06\%$ (structural) and $81.01\%$ (uniform) in node classification, close to the $81.31\%$ achieved by a standard GCN with full features. For link prediction under the same setting, it reaches AUC scores of $91.65\%$ (structural) and $92.41\%$ (uniform), compared to $95.06\%$ for the fully observed case. Furthermore, FSD-CAP demonstrates superior performance on both large-scale and heterophily datasets when compared to other models.

Conclusion: 稀疏神经元级更新为全模型微调提供了可扩展且精确的替代方案

Abstract: Behavioral alignment in large language models (LLMs) is often achieved through broad fine-tuning, which can result in undesired side effects like distributional shift and low interpretability. We propose a method for alignment that identifies and updates only the neurons most responsible for a given behavior, a targeted approach that allows for fine-tuning with significantly less data. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and linear probes, we isolate the 3% of MLP neurons most predictive of a target behavior, decode them into residual space, and fine-tune only those neurons using gradient masking. We demonstrate this approach on the task of reducing sycophantic behavior, where our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks (Syco-Bench, NLP, POLI, PHIL) using Gemma-2-2B and 9B models. Our results show that sparse, neuron-level updates offer a scalable and precise alternative to full-model fine-tuning, remaining effective even in situations when little data is available

Abstract: We propose an (offline) multi-dimensional distributional reinforcement learning framework (KE-DRL) that leverages Hilbert space mappings to estimate the kernel mean embedding of the multi-dimensional value distribution under a proposed target policy. In our setting, the state-action variables are multi-dimensional and continuous. By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, our method replaces Wasserstein metrics with an integral probability metric. This enables efficient estimation in multi-dimensional state-action spaces and reward settings, where direct computation of Wasserstein distances is computationally challenging. Theoretically, we establish contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator under our proposed metric involving the Matern family of kernels and provide uniform convergence guarantees. Simulations and empirical results demonstrate robust off-policy evaluation and recovery of the kernel mean embedding under mild assumptions, namely, Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the kernels, highlighting the potential of embedding-based approaches in complex real-world decision-making scenarios and risk evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了"自优化"显微技术，为高通量原子结构探索提供了灵活高效的像差校正解决方案。

Abstract: Realizing high-throughput aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) exploration of atomic structures requires rapid tuning of multipole probe correctors while compensating for the inevitable drift of the optical column. While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. By balancing competing objectives, this approach enables "self-optimizing" microscopy by dynamically sustaining optimal performance during experiments.

Conclusion: 建立了可迁移的自适应控制决策框架，为降低云量子处理器逐设备校准时间提供理论依据，适用于量子与经典控制场景

Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.

TL;DR: 该论文指出过程奖励模型(PRM)的评估目标(检测第一个错误步骤)与其在强化学习中的实际使用方式(将步骤得分作为原始奖励)存在错位。为此提出可验证前缀策略优化(VPPO)，利用PRM仅定位首个错误，将错误轨迹分割为已验证的正确前缀和错误后缀，分别给予奖励和惩罚，从而改进信用分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖稀疏的结果奖励，无法为部分成功解法中的正确中间步骤提供信用；而过程奖励模型虽能提供细粒度监督，但其评估目标与RL中的实际使用方式不匹配，导致信号噪声大和信用分配困难。

Method: 提出Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO)方法：在RL过程中，仅使用PRM定位第一个错误步骤；将错误轨迹划分为已验证的正确前缀和错误后缀；对前缀给予奖励，仅对后缀施加针对性惩罚，从而产生稳定、可解释的学习信号。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试上，VPPO在Pass@1和Pass@K指标上均持续优于稀疏奖励RL和先前PRM引导的基线方法。

Conclusion: VPPO通过重新对齐PRM的评估目标与RL使用方式，利用错误边界划分实现了更有效的信用分配，为LLM推理能力的提升提供了更稳定、可解释的训练信号。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on both Pass@1 and Pass@K.

### [55] [Randomization Boosts KV Caching, Learning Balances Query Load: A Joint Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18999)
*Fangzhou Wu,Sandeep Silwal,Qiuyi,Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first unified mathematical model for KV cache eviction and query routing in multi-LLM serving, revealing limitations of LRU and proposing integrated randomized eviction with learning-based routing that achieves up to 6.92× higher cache hit rate and 77.4% throughput improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV caching accelerates LLM inference but LRU eviction performs poorly under dynamic online queries in multi-worker scenarios, where balancing query load across workers conflicts with maximizing each worker's cache hit rate.

Method: Develops a unified mathematical model capturing eviction-routing trade-offs, analyzes theoretical limitations of existing methods, and creates principled algorithms combining provably competitive randomized KV cache eviction with learning-based adaptive query routing for evolving patterns.

Result: Validated across 4 benchmarks and 3 prefix-sharing settings: up to 6.92× cache hit rate improvement, 11.96× latency reduction, 14.06× TTFT reduction, and 77.4% throughput increase over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The unified model and integrated algorithms effectively resolve the fundamental conflict between load balancing and cache efficiency, significantly advancing LLM serving performance with publicly available code.

Abstract: KV caching is a fundamental technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by reusing key-value (KV) pairs from previous queries, but its effectiveness under limited memory is highly sensitive to the eviction policy. The default Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction algorithm struggles with dynamic online query arrivals, especially in multi-LLM serving scenarios, where balancing query load across workers and maximizing cache hit rate of each worker are inherently conflicting objectives. We give the first unified mathematical model that captures the core trade-offs between KV cache eviction and query routing. Our analysis reveals the theoretical limitations of existing methods and leads to principled algorithms that integrate provably competitive randomized KV cache eviction with learning-based methods to adaptively route queries with evolving patterns, thus balancing query load and cache hit rate. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments across 4 benchmarks and 3 prefix-sharing settings, demonstrating improvements of up to 6.92$\times$ in cache hit rate, 11.96$\times$ reduction in latency, 14.06$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT), and 77.4% increase in throughput over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to computationally efficient GP training based on the observation that square-exponential (SE) covariance matrices contain several off-diagonal entries extremely close to zero. We construct a principled procedure to eliminate those entries to produce a \emph{banded}-matrix approximation to the original covariance, whose inverse and determinant can be computed at a reduced computational cost, thus contributing to an efficient approximation to the likelihood function. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method to preserve the structure of the original covariance in the 1D setting with SE kernel, and validate its computational efficiency against the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVEREST是一个基于Transformer的罕见事件预测模型，通过融合不确定性量化和极值理论，在空间天气耀斑预测任务中实现了0.973的SOTA性能，模型紧凑且训练高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列中的罕见事件预测面临三大挑战：严重的类别不平衡、长期依赖关系以及分布不确定性，传统方法难以提供校准的概率预测和尾部风险评估。

Method: 提出EVEREST架构，包含四个核心组件：1）可学习注意力瓶颈用于时间动态的软聚合；2）证据头通过正态-逆伽马分布估计偶然不确定性和认知不确定性；3）极值头使用广义帕累托分布建模尾部风险；4）轻量级前驱头用于早期事件检测。这些模块在训练时联合优化（复合损失包含焦点损失、证据NLL和极值理论惩罚项），部署时仅使用单一分类头，无推理开销（约0.81M参数）。

Result: 在长达十年的空间天气数据上，针对C级耀斑预测，EVEREST在24/48/72小时时间跨度上分别达到0.973/0.970/0.966的True Skill Statistic (TSS)，性能显著优于现有方法。模型可在普通硬件上高效训练，适用于工业监测、气象和卫星诊断等高价值领域。

Conclusion: EVEREST通过创新的多模块协同设计有效解决了罕见事件预测的核心难题，提供了可解释性和不确定性感知能力。局限性包括依赖固定长度输入和未整合图像模态，未来将扩展至流式学习和多模态预测场景。

Abstract: Forecasting rare events in multivariate time-series data is challenging due to severe class imbalance, long-range dependencies, and distributional uncertainty. We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares. The model is compact, efficient to train on commodity hardware, and applicable to high-stakes domains such as industrial monitoring, weather, and satellite diagnostics. Limitations include reliance on fixed-length inputs and exclusion of image-based modalities, motivating future extensions to streaming and multimodal forecasting.

*Andrea Fasoli,Monodeep Kar,Chi-Chun Liu,Swagath Venkataramani,Viji Srinivasan,Leland Chang,Naigang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Microscaling quantization unexpectedly degrades when block size drops below a threshold. The paper identifies this anomaly stems from narrow tensor distributions meeting limited scale dynamic range, and proposes UE5M3 as a hardware-friendly FP4 format that maintains performance without global scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient training/inference with microscaling data formats, hardware-friendly implementations are needed. The discovery of anomalous degradation at small block sizes presents a critical barrier to optimal compression that must be understood and resolved.

Method: Combined experimental analysis of LLM distributions with a theoretical error-decoupling framework, validated against both pretrained and ideal tensor distributions.

Result: Identified that narrow tensor distributions interacting with limited scale dynamic range cause the anomaly; proposed UE5M3 format that matches E4M3 performance while eliminating global scaling overhead.

Conclusion: The quantization anomaly is fundamentally caused by distribution-range mismatch, and UE5M3 provides an effective hardware-friendly solution for FP4 microscaling by adapting scale representation to tensor characteristics.

Abstract: Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.

*Philip Amortila,Audrey Huang,Akshay Krishnamurthy,Nan Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文针对线性可实现性设置下的离线策略评估，提出了一种基于工具变量视角的LSTDQ算法有限样本分析，并引入了新颖的"特征动态覆盖"参数，统一了不同设置下的覆盖概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线策略评估（OPE）是强化学习的基本任务。虽然经典线性OPE在强假设（如Bellman完备性）下有明确的有限样本保证，但在仅目标价值函数线性可实现的最小设置下，现有研究的统计速率刻画不完整，覆盖参数的定义也不统一且存在缺陷。

Method: 本文对LSTDQ算法进行了新颖的有限样本分析，采用工具变量视角，提出了一个新的覆盖参数——特征动态覆盖（feature-dynamics coverage），可解释为特征演化诱导的动态系统中的线性覆盖。

Result: 所定义的覆盖参数在Bellman完备性等附加假设下能够成功恢复这些设置下的特定覆盖参数，最终为线性OPE中的覆盖提供了统一的理解。

Conclusion: 该研究解决了最小线性可实现性设置下覆盖参数定义不清的问题，通过特征动态覆盖参数将不同设置下的覆盖概念统一起来，深化了对离线策略评估的理论理解。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is a fundamental task in reinforcement learning (RL). In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \textrm{Evaluation error} \le \textrm{poly}(C^π, d, 1/n,\log(1/δ)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^π$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.
  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.

Conclusion: 实践中应优先检验群体基础比率平衡性，审慎选择公平性准则；该发现可推动优化现行法律框架与行业实践。

Abstract: A key challenge in employing data, algorithms and data-driven systems is to adhere to the principle of fairness and justice. Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion. The insights provided, we foresee, may trigger initiatives to improve or adjust the current practice and/or the existing legal frameworks.

*Anatol Ehrlich,Lorenz Kummer,Vojtech Voracek,Franka Bause,Nils M. Kriege*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XIMP (cross-graph inter-message passing) is a novel GNN framework that performs iterative message passing within and across multiple molecular graph representations (molecular graph, junction trees, reduced graphs) to improve property prediction in low-data drug discovery settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks underperform in data-scarce regimes for molecular property prediction and often fail to surpass traditional fingerprint methods. Single abstraction approaches or non-iterative cross-graph communication limit existing methods.

Method: XIMP performs message passing both within and across multiple related graph representations simultaneously. For small molecules, it integrates the molecular graph with scaffold-aware junction trees and pharmacophore-encoding extended reduced graphs. It supports arbitrary numbers of abstractions and both direct/indirect communication between them in each layer.

Result: Across ten diverse molecular property prediction tasks, XIMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in most cases, demonstrating superior performance in low-data regimes.

Conclusion: By leveraging interpretable molecular abstractions as inductive bias, XIMP guides learning toward established chemical concepts, enhancing generalization and providing a powerful framework for data-efficient molecular property prediction in drug discovery.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is central to drug discovery, yet graph neural networks often underperform in data-scarce regimes and fail to surpass traditional fingerprints. We introduce cross-graph inter-message passing (XIMP), which performs message passing both within and across multiple related graph representations. For small molecules, we combine the molecular graph with scaffold-aware junction trees and pharmacophore-encoding extended reduced graphs, integrating complementary abstractions. While prior work is either limited to a single abstraction or non-iterative communication across graphs, XIMP supports an arbitrary number of abstractions and both direct and indirect communication between them in each layer. Across ten diverse molecular property prediction tasks, XIMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in most cases, leveraging interpretable abstractions as an inductive bias that guides learning toward established chemical concepts, enhancing generalization in low-data settings.

Result: 在六个验证数据集和两个基础模型架构上，OATS始终优于常规训练和静态数据增强基线。

Conclusion: 该原则性在线增强策略为时间序列基础模型带来了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) are a powerful paradigm for time series analysis and are often enhanced by synthetic data augmentation to improve the training data quality. Existing augmentation methods, however, typically rely on heuristics and static paradigms. Motivated by dynamic data optimization, which shows that the contribution of samples varies across training stages, we propose OATS (Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models), a principled strategy that generates synthetic data tailored to different training steps. OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on TSFMs demonstrate that OATS consistently outperforms regular training and yields substantial performance gains over static data augmentation baselines across six validation datasets and two TSFM architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ensembling method to fine-tune LLMs using user-edit data, unifying preferences, supervised labels, and cost feedback. The method outperforms individual feedback approaches and adapts robustly to different user distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User-edit deployment data from LLM applications (writing assistants, coding agents) is a valuable natural source for model adaptation and personalization. The paper unifies typically separate feedback types (preferences, supervised labels, cost) in a theoretical framework.

Method: Theoretical analysis with derived learning bounds for each feedback type, plus a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from all three feedback types.

Result: The ensembling method outperforms single-feedback approaches on two domains and robustly adapts to different user-edit distributions at test time.

Conclusion: The theoretical bounds reveal different trade-offs based on user, data distribution, and model class. The ensembling approach effectively combines feedback types, offering better performance and robustness compared to individual methods.

Abstract: We study how to fine-tune LLMs using user-edit deployment data consisting of a set of context, an agent's response, and user edits. This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.

*W. A. Zúñiga-Galindo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper rigorously analyzes the thermodynamic limit (infinite-width) of neural networks using p-adic mathematics, revealing a critical bifurcation where networks transition from unique to infinite states, and characterizes output distributions for random networks as power-type expansions with Gaussian limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding phase transitions and critical behavior in deep and recurrent neural networks, particularly in the infinite-width limit, and to connect hierarchical neural network structures to mathematical frameworks like p-adic numbers.

Method: The study employs thermodynamic limit analysis, p-adic integer codification of hierarchical structures, algorithmic conversion of topologies to p-adic trees, and examination of random networks with Gaussian parameter distributions in L² function spaces.

Result: The continuous network exhibits a unique parameter-dependent state within a specific region, transitioning to infinitely many states outside it; this critical organization is a bifurcation point. Hierarchical and critical organizations connect via p-adic frameworks. A toy edge detector model shows critical organization as a strange attractor. Random network outputs follow power-type expansions with Gaussian constant terms.

Conclusion: The work provides a rigorous mathematical framework demonstrating that neural networks undergo critical transitions between unique and infinite states, with p-adic structures capturing hierarchical organization, and establishes that random infinite-width networks produce output distributions with predictable Gaussian-dominated asymptotic behavior.

Abstract: We rigorously study the thermodynamic limit of deep neural networks (DNNS) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), assuming that the activation functions are sigmoids. A thermodynamic limit is a continuous neural network, where the neurons form a continuous space with infinitely many points. We show that such a network admits a unique state in a certain region of the parameter space, which depends continuously on the parameters. This state breaks into an infinite number of states outside the mentioned region of parameter space. Then, the critical organization is a bifurcation in the parameter space, where a network transitions from a unique state to infinitely many states. We use p-adic integers to codify hierarchical structures. Indeed, we present an algorithm that recasts the hierarchical topologies used in DNNs and RNNs as p-adic tree-like structures. In this framework, the hierarchical and the critical organizations are connected. We study rigorously the critical organization of a toy model, a hierarchical edge detector for grayscale images based on p-adic cellular neural networks. The critical organization of such a network can be described as a strange attractor. In the second part, we study random versions of DNNs and RNNs. In this case, the network parameters are generalized Gaussian random variables in a space of quadratic integrable functions. We compute the probability distribution of the output given the input, in the infinite-width case. We show that it admits a power-type expansion, where the constant term is a Gaussian distribution.

*Joshua V. Dillon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A biologically-inspired winner-take-all approach for Tiny Recursive Models that uses early exiting and selective backpropagation to achieve high Sudoku accuracy with 10x less compute than test-time augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological neural systems use winner-take-all circuits and time-to-first-spike coding for energy-efficient, fast decisions. This paper applies this principle to neural networks to improve computational efficiency.

Method: Apply winner-take-all dynamics to TRM ensembles by using only the first model to halt for predictions. During training, maintain K parallel latent states but backpropagate only through the lowest-loss "winner." Also developed modified SwiGLU to enable Muon optimizer.

Result: Achieves 97.2% Sudoku accuracy with 10x less compute than TTA (baseline: 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Single model with K=4 training reaches 96.9% accuracy with one forward pass. With Muon, exceeds baseline in 7k steps (40 min); higher accuracy in 36k steps (1.5-6 hours).

Conclusion: Inference speed implicitly indicates confidence and can be learned through training-only costs. Biologically-inspired efficiency principles can match expensive TTA while reducing computation, though requiring innovations like modified SwiGLU for optimizer viability.

Abstract: Biological neural systems must be fast but are energy-constrained. Evolution's solution: act on the first signal. Winner-take-all circuits and time-to-first-spike coding implicitly treat when a neuron fires as an expression of confidence. We apply this principle to ensembles of Tiny Recursive Models (TRM). By basing the ensemble prediction solely on the first to halt rather than averaging predictions, we achieve 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme while using 10x less compute than test-time augmentation (the baseline achieves 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Inference speed is an implicit indication of confidence. But can this capability be manifested as a training-only cost? Evidently yes: by maintaining K = 4 parallel latent states during training but backpropping only through the lowest-loss "winner," a single model achieves 96.9% +/- 0.6% puzzle accuracy with a single forward pass-matching TTA performance without any test-time augmentation. As in nature, this work was also resource constrained: all experimentation used a single RTX 5090. This necessitated efficiency and compelled our invention of a modified SwiGLU which made Muon viable. With Muon and K = 1 training, we exceed TRM baseline performance in 7k steps (40 min). Higher accuracy requires 36k steps: 1.5 hours for K = 1, 6 hours for K = 4.

*Rezaul Karim,Maryam Dialameh,Yang Liu,Boxing Chen,Walid Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPAS introduces progressive activation sharing during training, starting from deep layers and expanding towards shallow ones, achieving up to 11.1% training throughput gain and 29% inference throughput improvement while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers exhibit redundant QK/KV activations across deeper layers, which presents an opportunity for computational efficiency through activation sharing without significant performance loss.

Method: EPAS gradually grows a sharing region from the deep end to shallow end of the model during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode, enabling variable sharing lengths for different inference compute budgets.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA models (125M-7B parameters) show up to 11.1% training throughput improvement and 29% inference throughput gain while maintaining similar loss curves; continual pretraining yields up to 10% accuracy improvement over SOTA methods.

Conclusion: Progressive training is crucial for effective cross-layer activation sharing, and EPAS successfully bridges this paradigm with redundancy exploitation to achieve significant efficiency gains without sacrificing model quality.

Abstract: We present a novel method for Efficient training with Progressive Activation Sharing (EPAS). This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models.

Abstract: While many deep learning models trained on private datasets have been deployed in various practical tasks, they may pose a privacy leakage risk as attackers could recover informative data or label knowledge from models. In this work, we present \emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts.

Conclusion: 与局限于先验空间内检索/仿真的神经物理求解器不同，NOVA能够可靠外推到未知区域，这对科学发现中的假设空间探索至关重要。

Abstract: Neural physics solvers are increasingly used in scientific discovery, given their potential for rapid in silico insights into physical, materials, or biological systems and their long-time evolution. However, poor generalization beyond their training support limits exploration of novel designs and long-time horizon predictions. We introduce NOVA, a route to generalizable neural physics solvers that can provide rapid, accurate solutions to scenarios even under distributional shifts in partial differential equation parameters, geometries and initial conditions. By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization. Unlike neural physics solvers that are constrained to retrieval and/or emulation within an a priori space, NOVA enables reliable extrapolation beyond known regimes, a key capability given the need for exploration of novel hypothesis spaces in scientific discovery

### [69] [FloydNet: A Learning Paradigm for Global Relational Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19094)
*Jingcheng Yu,Mingliang Zeng,Qiwei Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes FloydNet, a dynamic programming-based graph architecture that replaces local message passing with global tensor refinement, achieving 3-WL expressivity and state-of-the-art performance on algorithmic benchmarks and TSP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are fundamentally limited by their local message-passing mechanism, which creates a bottleneck for global, holistic reasoning required for complex multi-step problems. The authors argue dynamic programming offers a more powerful learning paradigm for such tasks.

Method: Introduce FloydNet which maintains a global all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized dynamic programming operator to iteratively refine it, enabling task-specific relational calculus for capturing long-range dependencies.

Result: FloydNet achieves >99% accuracy on CLRS-30, finds exact TSP solutions significantly better than strong heuristics, matches 3-WL test on BREC benchmark, and theoretically achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power.

Conclusion: Learned DP-style refinement provides a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning.

*Lecheng Zheng,Dongqi Fu,Zihao Li,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A zero-shot graph anomaly detection framework OWLEYE that learns transferable normal patterns from multiple graphs through feature alignment, dictionary learning, and attention-based reconstruction, achieving superior cross-domain performance without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing foundational generalist models for graph anomaly detection across different domains is hindered by varying feature semantics and dimensions, making continual learning and inference capabilities challenging for unseen graphs.

Method: OWLEYE framework with three components: (1) cross-domain feature alignment to harmonize distributions while preserving domain semantics, (2) multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural/attribute patterns, and (3) truncated attention-based reconstruction module for in-context anomaly detection without labeled data.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: OWLEYE establishes a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection, enabling zero-shot detection on unseen graphs without retraining.

Abstract: Graph data is informative to represent complex relationships such as transactions between accounts, communications between devices, and dependencies among machines or processes. Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.

TL;DR: TinyTorch is a 20-module pure Python curriculum that teaches ML systems engineering by having students implement PyTorch from scratch, integrating algorithms and systems education to prepare graduates for real-world deployment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML education separates algorithms from systems (e.g., learning gradient descent without memory usage, attention without computational cost), leaving graduates unprepared for production debugging and widening the research-deployment gap.

Method: A 20-module curriculum where students implement PyTorch components (tensors, autograd, optimizers, neural networks) in pure Python, based on three principles: progressive disclosure, systems-first integration, and historical milestone validation.

Result: The curriculum requires only a 4GB RAM laptop without GPU, is open source at mlsysbook.ai/tinytorch, and makes ML systems education accessible worldwide.

Conclusion: TinyTorch aims to produce AI engineers who understand not just what ML systems do, but why they work and how to scale them, bridging the gap between theory and reliable deployment.

Abstract: Machine learning systems engineering requires a deep understanding of framework internals. Yet most current education separates algorithms from systems. Students learn gradient descent without measuring memory usage, and attention mechanisms without profiling computational cost. This split leaves graduates unprepared to debug real production failures and widens the gap between machine learning research and reliable deployment. We present TinyTorch, a 20 module curriculum in which students implement the core components of PyTorch, including tensors, autograd, optimizers, and neural networks, entirely in pure Python. The curriculum is built around three pedagogical principles. Progressive disclosure gradually introduces complexity as students build confidence. Systems first integration embeds memory and performance awareness from the very beginning. Historical milestone validation guides students to recreate key breakthroughs, from the Perceptron in 1958 to modern Transformers, using only code they have written themselves. TinyTorch requires only a laptop with 4GB of RAM and no GPU, making machine learning systems education accessible worldwide. Its goal is to prepare the next generation of AI engineers, practitioners who understand not only what machine learning systems do, but why they work and how to make them scale. The curriculum is available as open source at mlsysbook.ai slash tinytorch.

TL;DR: vllm-mlx is a native MLX-based framework that significantly accelerates LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon, outperforming existing tools with up to 87% higher throughput for text models and 28x speedup for multimodal queries via continuous batching and content-based prefix caching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Apple Silicon inference tools lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or only support text models (llama.cpp), leaving multimodal workloads underserved despite growing ML development on Apple hardware.

Method: Built natively on MLX framework, implementing continuous batching for text models and content-based prefix caching that uses content hashing to identify identical images and eliminate redundant vision encoding.

Result: Achieved 21-87% higher throughput than llama.cpp on M4 Max (up to 525 tokens/sec), 4.3x aggregate throughput with 16 concurrent requests, 28x speedup on repeated image queries (21.7s to <1s), and 24.7x cache speedup for video analysis.

Conclusion: The framework provides efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware and has been released as open source to benefit the broader developer community.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models (llama.cpp), leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21% to 87% higher throughput than llama.cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.

TL;DR: 提出一种可扩展的高斯copula方法用于符号图链接预测，通过边嵌入的格拉姆矩阵表示相关矩阵并重构概率分布，实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号图链接符号预测需判断边为正或负。负边违反图同质性假设，传统方法失效。虽可用高斯copula建模边间依赖，但直接建模计算不可行。

Method: 1) 将相关矩阵表示为边嵌入的格拉姆矩阵，大幅减少参数量；2) 重构条件概率分布，显著降低推理成本；3) 扩展CopulaGNN，直接建模边间统计依赖。

Result: 理论验证线性收敛性，实验表明收敛速度显著快于基线，且预测性能与最先进模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展性强，在保持竞争力的同时大幅提升效率。

Abstract: Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN. However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结合非均匀方差正则化与等距约束的自编码器框架，作为PCA的自然非线性推广，在保持有序表示和方差保留优势的同时有效处理非线性降维任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性自编码器（LAE）通过非均匀ℓ₂正则化可恢复PCA主轴，但非线性场景下无法独立于非线性映射捕获剩余方差，导致传统方法失效

Method: 设计新型自编码器框架，集成非均匀方差正则化与等距约束，实现PCA核心特性（有序表示/方差保留）向非线性降维的自然扩展

Result: 成功保留PCA关键优势（有序潜在表示、方差保留能力），同时有效适用于非线性维度约简任务

Conclusion: 该框架是主成分分析（PCA）的自然非线性推广，解决了传统方法在非线性场景下的局限性，为非线性降维提供了兼具理论合理性与实用性的新方案

Abstract: Autoencoders have long been considered a nonlinear extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Prior studies have demonstrated that linear autoencoders (LAEs) can recover the ordered, axis-aligned principal components of PCA by incorporating non-uniform $\ell_2$ regularization or by adjusting the loss function. However, these approaches become insufficient in the nonlinear setting, as the remaining variance cannot be properly captured independently of the nonlinear mapping. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder framework that integrates non-uniform variance regularization with an isometric constraint. This design serves as a natural generalization of PCA, enabling the model to preserve key advantages, such as ordered representations and variance retention, while remaining effective for nonlinear dimensionality reduction tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers created an automated pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into labeled outcome data, then trained a compact LLM that predicts risk probability better than GPT-5, enabling scalable domain-specific AI without manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEC risk disclosures lack quantified likelihoods, limiting probabilistic analysis. A major obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.

Method: Developed a fully automated data generation pipeline that creates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from SEC Risk Factors sections and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures. Used this dataset to train a compact large language model to estimate risk materialization probabilities.

Result: The compact model substantially outperformed pretrained and heuristic baselines, and exceeded frontier general-purpose models including GPT-5 on probabilistic accuracy and calibration, while remaining deployable on a single GPU.

Conclusion: This "Foresight Learning" approach enables scalable, automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological enterprise documents—without proprietary data or manual annotation—suggesting a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring text.

Abstract: Risk disclosures in SEC filings describe potential adverse events but rarely quantify their likelihood, limiting their usefulness for probabilistic analysis. A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.
  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.
  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.
  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU. This result suggests a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring enterprise documents.
  To support transparency and reproducibility, we open-source the evaluation dataset used in this study.

TL;DR: 本文提出A-MWGraD算法，一种基于Nesterov加速的多元Wasserstein梯度下降改进方法，在测地凸目标下将收敛率从O(1/t)提升至O(1/t²)，并通过数值实验验证了其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MWGraD算法在多目标Wasserstein空间优化中利用了空间的几何结构，但其收敛速率仅为O(1/t)，存在优化空间。本文旨在通过加速技术提升算法效率。

Method: 受Nesterov加速技术启发，提出A-MWGraD算法；分析其连续时间动态；建立收敛性理论；设计实用的基于核的离散化方法；在多目标采样任务上进行数值实验验证。

Result: 理论分析表明：对于测地凸目标函数，A-MWGraD达到O(1/t²)收敛率；对于β-强测地凸目标函数，达到O(e^{-√βt})收敛率，均优于MWGraD的O(1/t)。数值实验证实A-MWGraD在收敛速度和采样效率上持续优于MWGraD。

Conclusion: A-MWGraD算法显著提升了多目标Wasserstein优化的性能，为概率分布优化提供了更高效的解决方案，展现了加速技术在几何优化中的有效性。

Abstract: We study multi-objective optimization over probability distributions in Wasserstein space. Recently, Nguyen et al. (2025) introduced Multiple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD) algorithm, which exploits the geometric structure of Wasserstein space to jointly optimize multiple objectives. Building on this approach, we propose an accelerated variant, A-MWGraD, inspired by Nesterov's acceleration. We analyze the continuous-time dynamics and establish convergence to weakly Pareto optimal points in probability space. Our theoretical results show that A-MWGraD achieves a convergence rate of O(1/t^2) for geodesically convex objectives and O(e^{-\sqrtβt}) for $β$-strongly geodesically convex objectives, improving upon the O(1/t) rate of MWGraD in the geodesically convex setting. We further introduce a practical kernel-based discretization for A-MWGraD and demonstrate through numerical experiments that it consistently outperforms MWGraD in convergence speed and sampling efficiency on multi-target sampling tasks.

Conclusion: SOLD通过融合扩散模型与强化学习，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，可高效优化多结构目标，对生物技术和治疗应用具有深远影响。

Abstract: RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for supply chain management to take proactive operations, but faces challenges: classical unsupervised anomaly detection based on exploiting data patterns often yields results misaligned with business requirements and domain knowledge, while manual expert analysis cannot scale to millions of products in the supply chain. We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment. The proposed framework thus demonstrates how LLMs can bridge the gap between scalable automation and expert-driven decision-making in operational settings.

Conclusion: 该框架形成涌现课程，对抗机制将资源动态转移到不断演进的推理前沿，显著提升LLM推理性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning is increasingly driven by the refinement of post-training loss functions and alignment strategies. However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.
  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline. Qualitative analysis shows an emergent curriculum: the adversaries shift resources to the evolving reasoning frontier, enhancing the reasoning model's performance.

We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization. Experiments across multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving generalization while maintaining high generation quality.

### [82] [Process-Aware Procurement Lead Time Prediction for Shipyard Delay Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19296)
*Yongjae Lee,Eunhee Park,Daesan Park,Dongho Kim,Jongho Choi,Hyerim Bae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework combining event logs with static attributes using a deep sequential neural network to predict procurement lead time in shipbuilding, achieving 22.6-50.4% improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PLT prediction methods only use static physical attributes of pipe spools but ignore the dynamic, multi-stakeholder procurement process involving continuous internal and external events, which can cause delays in critical components and disrupt project timelines.

Method: The authors propose a framework that extracts temporal attributes from event logs to capture process continuity and context, then uses a deep sequential neural network combined with a multi-layered perceptron to integrate static and dynamic features for PLT prediction.

Result: Using real-world data from a South Korean shipbuilding corporation, the framework improved prediction performance by 22.6% to 50.4% in mean absolute error across three tasks (production, post-processing, and procurement lead time prediction) compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Incorporating procurement process information through event logs significantly enhances PLT prediction accuracy, demonstrating the value of considering both static attributes and dynamic process events.

Abstract: Accurately predicting procurement lead time (PLT) remains a challenge in engineered-to-order industries such as shipbuilding and plant construction, where delays in a single key component can disrupt project timelines. In shipyards, pipe spools are critical components; installed deep within hull blocks soon after steel erection, any delay in their procurement can halt all downstream tasks. Recognizing their importance, existing studies predict PLT using the static physical attributes of pipe spools. However, procurement is inherently a dynamic, multi-stakeholder business process involving a continuous sequence of internal and external events at the shipyard, factors often overlooked in traditional approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework that combines event logs, dataset records of the procurement events, with static attributes to predict PLT. The temporal attributes of each event are extracted to reflect the continuity and temporal context of the process. Subsequently, a deep sequential neural network combined with a multi-layered perceptron is employed to integrate these static and dynamic features, enabling the model to capture both structural and contextual information in procurement. Comparative experiments are conducted using real-world pipe spool procurement data from a globally renowned South Korean shipbuilding corporation. Three tasks are evaluated, which are production, post-processing, and procurement lead time prediction. The results show a 22.6% to 50.4% improvement in prediction performance in terms of mean absolute error over the best-performing existing approaches across the three tasks. These findings indicate the value of considering procurement process information for more accurate PLT prediction.

Conclusion: 该工作为上下文感知调度提供了新理论框架，通过算法设计与分析技术创新，在随机和对抗环境下均实现了有效的学习性能保证。

Abstract: We introduce contextual queueing bandits, a new context-aware framework for scheduling while simultaneously learning unknown service rates. Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences. We show that our algorithm, CQB-$\varepsilon$, achieves a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. We also consider the setting of adversarially chosen contexts, for which our second algorithm, CQB-Opt, achieves a regret upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)$. Lastly, we provide experimental results that validate our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 事件感知表示学习能有效提升MBRL的跨场景泛化能力，该方法具有广泛适用性并为世界模型研究提供了新范式。

Abstract: While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes LightSBB-M, an efficient algorithm for Schrödinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation that jointly optimizes drift and volatility, achieving superior performance in few iterations compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The classical Schrödinger Bridge (SB) only controls drift, but the SBB formulation extends it by jointly controlling drift and volatility. The motivation is to develop an efficient algorithm that can compute optimal SBB transport plans with high fidelity and scalability, addressing limitations of existing SB and diffusion methods.

Method: LightSBB-M exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to derive analytic expressions for optimal drift and volatility. It incorporates a tunable parameter beta > 0 that interpolates between pure drift (SB) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport), enabling flexible control over the transport characteristics.

Result: On synthetic datasets, LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance with up to 32% improvement over state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines. It also demonstrates strong generative capability on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ).

Conclusion: LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks, offering an efficient solution for optimal transport problems requiring joint drift and volatility control.

Abstract: The Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation, which jointly controls drift and volatility, is an established extension of the classical Schrodinger Bridge (SB). Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks.

Conclusion: 该工作为在不确定环境中增强模型可靠性提供了原则性且有效的框架。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in deep learning models is critical for reliable decision-making in high-stakes applications such as medical imaging. Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift. This work provides a principled and effective framework for enhancing model reliability in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Machine learning models have demonstrated strong performance in classifying network traffic and identifying Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, enabling operators to discover and manage IoT assets at scale. However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment.

TL;DR: 提出Selective Steering方法，通过数学严谨的保范数旋转和判别性层选择，在保持LLM性能稳定的同时实现可控的行为修正，攻击成功率提升5.5倍且零困惑度违规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活 steering 方法存在关键缺陷：激活添加需要精细调参且对层范数敏感；方向性消融仅提供二元控制；Angular Steering虽支持连续控制但破坏范数保持，导致分布偏移和生成分崩离析，尤其在7B参数以下模型中。

Method: 提出Selective Steering，包含两大创新：(1) 数学严谨的保范数旋转公式，维持激活分布完整性；(2) 判别性层选择，仅在特征表示呈现相反类别对齐的层应用steering。

Result: 在九个模型上的实验表明，该方法比先前方法攻击成功率高5.5倍，同时实现零困惑度违规和标准基准测试约100%能力保留。

Conclusion: 提供了一种原则性、高效的框架，用于可控且稳定的LLM行为修改。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering

Conclusion: APC通过灵活利用多源演示数据，解决了非理想演示环境下的策略优化问题，显著提升强化学习在现实场景的适用性

Abstract: Incorporating demonstration data into reinforcement learning (RL) can greatly accelerate learning, but existing approaches often assume demonstrations are optimal and fully aligned with the target task. In practice, demonstrations are frequently sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when these demonstrations are integrated into RL. We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.

Motivation: 经典k-聚类算法需要精确的两两距离，这在许多现代应用中是不现实的。本文研究Rank模型(R-model)，其中距离访问被四元组预言机完全取代，该预言机仅提供相对距离比较，可表示学习模型或人类反馈，且是噪声的并存在访问成本。

Result: 对于任意度量空间，算法查询复杂度为O(n·k·polylog(n))，聚类代价为最优k-聚类代价的常数倍。当底层度量具有有限倍增维数时，查询复杂度改进为O((n+k²)·polylog(n))，且可进一步提升近似比至1+ε（对任意小的ε∈(0,1)），同时保持相同渐近查询复杂度。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了如何将噪声、低成本的预言机（如大语言模型）系统地集成到可扩展的聚类算法中。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning. However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.
  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\cdot k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity. Our framework demonstrates how noisy, low-cost oracles, such as those derived from large language models, can be systematically integrated into scalable clustering algorithms.

TL;DR: LLM-VA aligns answer vectors with safety judgment vectors via closed-form weight updates, eliminating the trade-off between jailbreak and over-refusal in safety-aligned LLMs while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-aligned LLMs suffer from a fundamental trade-off: reducing jailbreak attacks inevitably increases over-refusal of benign queries, because existing methods treat answer decisions and safety judgments as independent orthogonal processes.

Method: Identifies answer vectors (v_a) and benign vectors (v_b) using SVMs at each layer, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns them via minimum-norm weight modifications to make answer willingness causally dependent on safety assessment.

Result: Achieves 11.45% higher F1 than best baseline across 12 LLMs while preserving 95.92% utility, automatically adapting to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

Conclusion: By aligning the directional relationship between answer and safety vectors through closed-form weight updates, LLM-VA effectively resolves the jailbreak-overrefusal trade-off without fine-tuning or architectural changes.

Abstract: Safety-aligned LLMs suffer from two failure modes: jailbreak (answering harmful inputs) and over-refusal (declining benign queries). Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

Conclusion: 该工作为深度模型提供了结构保证，使自适应计算更加可靠，并为理解深度模型的迭代 refinement 过程提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: Recent deep learning models increasingly rely on depth without structural guarantees on the validity of intermediate representations, rendering early stopping and adaptive computation ill-posed. We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias. Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives. Controlled experiments on ImageNet-100 empirically verify the predicted scale-consistent behavior, showing that adaptive efficiency emerges from the aligned latent geometry.

Conclusion: 结构平衡是解决图不平衡分类的关键，GraphSB通过两阶段结构优化有效平衡图结构，显著提升GNN学习效果，且具备良好可扩展性

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 4.57%.

Abstract: Public olfaction datasets are small and fragmented across single molecules and mixtures, limiting learning of generalizable odor representations. Recent works either learn single-molecule embeddings or address mixtures via similarity or pairwise label prediction, leaving representations separate and unaligned. In this work, we propose AROMMA, a framework that learns a unified embedding space for single molecules and two-molecule mixtures. Each molecule is encoded by a chemical foundation model and the mixtures are composed by an attention-based aggregator, ensuring both permutation invariance and asymmetric molecular interactions. We further align odor descriptor sets using knowledge distillation and class-aware pseudo-labeling to enrich missing mixture annotations. AROMMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-molecule and molecule-pair datasets, with up to 19.1% AUROC improvement, demonstrating a robust generalization in two domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DGRC, a method to adapt LLMs to specialized domains without human annotation by using disagreements between teacher and student models to create a curriculum that moves from atomic knowledge to complex reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LLMs to specialized domains without human-annotated data is challenging. Traditional knowledge distillation suffers from coarse-grained mimicry, where students target their own weaknesses and may inherit teacher's reasoning flaws, creating a pedagogical dilemma when teachers aren't infallible experts.

Method: The Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC) exploits that LLMs are reliable on atomic sub-problems but fallible on complex reasoning. When student and teacher disagree, DGRC has the teacher analyze both reasoning paths to generate targeted atomic queries about divergence points, self-answer them to create high-confidence atomic QA pairs, then use these to both fix student knowledge gaps and filter teacher's reasoning chains into a verified curriculum.

Result: Experiments in medical and legal domains across various model sizes show DGRC's effectiveness. Notably, it achieves 7.76% relative improvement for a 1.5B parameter student model in the medical domain compared to strong unlabeled baselines.

Conclusion: DGRC successfully creates a reliable curriculum for domain adaptation by leveraging model disagreements to build a learning path from atomic knowledge to verified reasoning chains, overcoming the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains without human-annotated data is a crucial yet formidable challenge. Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline.

TL;DR: 针对领域泛化问题，本文提出基于协方差分析的参数敏感性框架DSP-Reg，通过正则化领域敏感参数提升模型泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视参数层面的敏感性分析，无法区分领域敏感与稳健参数，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 构建参数梯度协方差分析框架量化参数敏感性，提出DSP-Reg软正则化策略，鼓励模型依赖领域不变参数。

Result: 在PACS、VLCS、OfficeHome和DomainNet基准测试中，DSP-Reg平均准确率达66.7%，超越所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了参数级的精细控制，显著提升了模型在未见领域的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) is a critical area that focuses on developing models capable of performing well on data from unseen distributions, which is essential for real-world applications. Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\% and surpassing all baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出基于混合整数优化的统一框架，用于训练兼具交叉公平性与内在可解释性的分类器，证明了两种公平性指标的等价性，并实证验证了其在偏见检测上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在金融、医疗等高風險领域的部署要求模型兼具公平性与透明度。尽管欧盟AI法案等监管框架强制要求缓解偏见，却故意模糊了偏见的定义。与现有研究一致，我们认为真正的公平性必须解决受保护群体交叉点上的偏见问题。

Method: 作者提出统一框架，利用混合整数优化（MIO）训练具有内在解释性的分类器。研究证明了两种交叉公平性度量（MSD与SPSF）在识别最不公平子群时的等价性，并基于MIO设计算法以界定交叉偏见在可接受阈值之下。

Result: 实证结果表明，基于MIO的算法在发现偏见方面性能更优。该框架成功训练出高性能、可解释的分类器，将交叉偏见严格控制在预设阈值以下。

Conclusion: 该方案为受监管行业及其他领域提供了稳健的偏见缓解解决方案，使企业能够部署既符合公平透明要求又满足监管标准的AI系统。

Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence in high-risk domains, such as finance and healthcare, necessitates models that are both fair and transparent. While regulatory frameworks, including the EU's AI Act, mandate bias mitigation, they are deliberately vague about the definition of bias. In line with existing research, we argue that true fairness requires addressing bias at the intersections of protected groups. We propose a unified framework that leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and intrinsically interpretable classifiers. We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond.

*Saeed Nasehi Basharzad,Farhana Choudhury,Egemen Tanin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEAFormer is a novel transformer that solves real-world vehicle routing problems by incorporating node and edge information through Clustered Proximity Attention and an edge-aware module, achieving state-of-the-art results on both RWVRPs and classic VRPs at scale (1000+ nodes).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (RWVRPs) involve complex sequence-dependent challenges with constraints like time windows and asymmetric travel costs. Existing neural methods struggle because they overlook sequence dependencies and underutilize edge-level information, which are critical characteristics of RWVRPs.

Method: SEAFormer incorporates two key innovations: (1) Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) that uses locality-aware clustering to reduce attention complexity from O(n²) to O(n) while preserving global perspective; (2) a lightweight edge-aware module that captures pairwise features through residual fusion to effectively incorporate edge-based information and enable faster convergence.

Result: Extensive experiments across four RWVRP variants show SEAFormer achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods. It is the first neural method to effectively solve 1,000+ node RWVRPs while also performing excellently on classic VRPs.

Conclusion: SEAFormer provides a versatile solution for both research benchmarks and real-world applications, successfully addressing the limitations of existing neural methods for RWVRPs.

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (RWVRPs) require solving complex, sequence-dependent challenges at scale with constraints such as delivery time window, replenishment or recharging stops, asymmetric travel cost, etc. While recent neural methods achieve strong results on large-scale classical VRP benchmarks, they struggle to address RWVRPs because their strategies overlook sequence dependencies and underutilize edge-level information, which are precisely the characteristics that define the complexity of RWVRPs. We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances. Second, our lightweight edge-aware module captures pairwise features through residual fusion, enabling effective incorporation of edge-based information and faster convergence. Extensive experiments across four RWVRP variants with various scales demonstrate that SEAFormer achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SEAFormer is the first neural method to solve 1,000+ node RWVRPs effectively, while also achieving superior performance on classic VRPs, making it a versatile solution for both research benchmarks and real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的多头注意力机制MEA，通过显式建模头间交互，提升模型性能并实现50%的KV缓存压缩，且性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构中的多头注意力机制存在头间交互不足的问题，近期研究表明增强头间交互能提升注意力性能。

Method: 提出多头显式注意力(MEA)，包含两个核心组件：1)头级线性组合(HLC)模块，对跨头的键和值向量进行可学习的线性组合以实现头间通信；2)头级组归一化层，对齐重组后的头的统计特性。同时探索参数效率，通过减少注意力头数量并利用HLC构建低秩"虚拟头"来实现KV缓存压缩。

Result: MEA在预训练中表现出强鲁棒性，可使用更大学习率实现更快收敛，获得更低的验证损失和更好的任务性能。KV缓存内存使用减少50%，在知识密集和科学推理任务上性能损失可忽略，奥林匹克数学基准测试仅下降3.59%准确率。

Conclusion: MEA是一种简单有效的注意力变体，能显式建模跨头交互，在提升模型性能的同时实现高效的KV缓存压缩，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In large language models built upon the Transformer architecture, recent studies have shown that inter-head interaction can enhance attention performance. Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: OSIRIS通过解决数据瓶颈推动模拟IC设计自动化，为端到端ML框架奠定基础，加速电子设计自动化领域的机器学习应用

Abstract: The automation of analog integrated circuit (IC) design remains a longstanding challenge, primarily due to the intricate interdependencies among physical layout, parasitic effects, and circuit-level performance. These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 87,100 circuit variations generated with OSIRIS, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)-based baseline method that exploits OSIRIS for analog design optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOOPER is a safe reinforcement learning method that combines optimistic exploration with pessimistic fallback to conservative policy priors, guaranteeing safety while converging to optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe exploration is critical for real-world reinforcement learning applications beyond controlled environments, requiring methods that prevent harmful actions during online learning and adaptation.

Method: SOOPER utilizes suboptimal conservative policies as priors and employs probabilistic dynamics models to enable optimistic exploration while pessimistically reverting to the safe policy when necessary.

Result: Theoretical analysis proves safety guarantees and convergence to optimal policy via bounded cumulative regret; experiments show SOOPER scales well, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks, and works on real hardware.

Conclusion: SOOPER successfully addresses safe exploration challenges in RL with both strong theoretical guarantees and practical validation, demonstrating superior performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Safe exploration is a key requirement for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn and adapt online, beyond controlled (e.g. simulated) environments. In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.

Motivation: 现有组策略优化方法依赖同批次高质量样本的组内优势差距，但在挑战性任务中容易出现优势崩溃，导致训练脆弱低效。

Method: R³机制包含：1）跨上下文重放策略，从相同查询的历史轨迹中召回有价值样例维持组内优势；2）上下文内自省机制，利用过去失败经验优化输出；3）结构熵排序奖励，基于token级熵模式对截断/失败样本分配相对奖励，平衡局部探索与全局稳定性。

Result: 在Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上实现，于DeepscaleR-40k数学数据集训练，在多个数学基准测试达到SOTA性能，相比基线模型显著提升且使用更少推理token。

Conclusion: R³机制有效解决了组优势崩溃问题，提升了训练稳定性和效率，在数学推理任务上取得突破性进展。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) aim to solve diverse and complex problems through structured reasoning. Recent advances in group-based policy optimization methods have shown promise in enabling stable advantage estimation without reliance on process-level annotations. However, these methods rely on advantage gaps induced by high-quality samples within the same batch, which makes the training process fragile and inefficient when intra-group advantages collapse under challenging tasks. To address these problems, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism named \emph{\textbf{R^3}} that along three directions: (1) a \emph{cross-context \underline{\textbf{R}}eplay} strategy that maintains the intra-group advantage by recalling valuable examples from historical trajectories of the same query, (2) an \emph{in-context self-\underline{\textbf{R}}eflection} mechanism enabling models to refine outputs by leveraging past failures, and (3) a \emph{structural entropy \underline{\textbf{R}}anking reward}, which assigns relative rewards to truncated or failed samples by ranking responses based on token-level entropy patterns, capturing both local exploration and global stability. We implement our method on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and train it on the DeepscaleR-40k in the math domain. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves SoTA performance on several math benchmarks, representing significant improvements and fewer reasoning tokens over the base models. Code and model will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑GNN必须依赖可训练聚合才能有效学习节点表示的传统认知，探索固定聚合的可行性。

Method: 使用预定义聚合函数(如均值)将图结构转换为固定特征表示(FAFs)，将其作为表格数据，用MLP等分类器进行训练。

Result: 在14个基准测试中，FAF+MLP在12个任务上达到或超过SOTA GNN/图Transformer性能，多数情况下仅需均值聚合；Roman Empire和Minesweeper是例外。

Conclusion: 主张：1)构建更丰富的基准测试；2)将强表格基线作为标准；3)发展和应用表格模型处理图数据。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely believed to excel at node representation learning through trainable neighborhood aggregations. We challenge this view by introducing Fixed Aggregation Features (FAFs), a training-free approach that transforms graph learning tasks into tabular problems. This simple shift enables the use of well-established tabular methods, offering strong interpretability and the flexibility to deploy diverse classifiers. Across 14 benchmarks, well-tuned multilayer perceptrons trained on FAFs rival or outperform state-of-the-art GNNs and graph transformers on 12 tasks -- often using only mean aggregation. The only exceptions are the Roman Empire and Minesweeper datasets, which typically require unusually deep GNNs. To explain the theoretical possibility of non-trainable aggregations, we connect our findings to Kolmogorov-Arnold representations and discuss when mean aggregation can be sufficient. In conclusion, our results call for (i) richer benchmarks benefiting from learning diverse neighborhood aggregations, (ii) strong tabular baselines as standard, and (iii) employing and advancing tabular models for graph data to gain new insights into related tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦大语言模型的部署中，无法确定具体哪些客户端贡献了特定的生成响应，这阻碍了调试、恶意客户端识别、公平奖励分配和信任验证等关键环节。

Method: ProToken利用两个关键洞察：1) 在Transformer架构中，任务特定信号集中在较深层，可进行策略性层选择以提高计算效率；2) 基于梯度的相关性加权可过滤无关神经激活，将溯源聚焦于直接影响令牌生成的神经元。

Result: 在涵盖四种架构（Gemma、Llama、Qwen、SmolLM）和四个领域（医疗、金融、数学、编程）的16种配置上，ProToken实现了98%的平均溯源准确率，且在客户端数量扩展时仍保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了联邦大语言模型中的客户端溯源挑战，验证了其在真实世界部署中的实际可行性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Large Language Models (LLMs) across distributed data sources while preserving privacy. However, when federated LLMs are deployed in critical applications, it remains unclear which client(s) contributed to specific generated responses, hindering debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification. We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings.

Motivation: 新建海上风电场亟需从投运初期获得准确功率预测以保障电网稳定、优化交易，但机器学习模型需要大量现场数据而新电场数据不足，存在冷启动问题。

Conclusion: 该气候感知迁移学习方法降低了数据需求，可应用于早期风资源评估，加速项目开发并降低风险，为海上风电行业提供新机遇。

Abstract: Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.

Conclusion: ODEdit作为即插即用的不变学习框架，为多模态大模型知识编辑提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.

TL;DR: The paper proposes GenCP, a generative modeling framework that integrates probability density evolution with iterative multiphysics coupling to enable training on decoupled simulation data while achieving high-fidelity coupled physics simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world physical systems involve complex multiphysics coupling, but mainstream approaches struggle with decoupled data and have low efficiency/fidelity in strongly coupled spatio-temporal systems.

Method: GenCP formulates coupled-physics as a probability modeling problem, integrating probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, using operator-splitting theory to guarantee error controllability.

Result: Evaluated on synthetic and three real multi-physics scenarios, GenCP demonstrated both theoretical soundness and superior performance.

Conclusion: GenCP provides an elegant, principled solution for coupled multiphysics simulation that overcomes limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Real-world physical systems are inherently complex, often involving the coupling of multiple physics, making their simulation both highly valuable and challenging. Many mainstream approaches face challenges when dealing with decoupled data. Besides, they also suffer from low efficiency and fidelity in strongly coupled spatio-temporal physical systems. Here we propose GenCP, a novel and elegant generative paradigm for coupled multiphysics simulation. By formulating coupled-physics modeling as a probability modeling problem, our key innovation is to integrate probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, thereby enabling training on data from decoupled simulation and inferring coupled physics during sampling. We also utilize operator-splitting theory in the space of probability evolution to establish error controllability guarantees for this "conditional-to-joint" sampling scheme. We evaluate our paradigm on a synthetic setting and three challenging multi-physics scenarios to demonstrate both principled insight and superior application performance of GenCP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised pre-training can accelerate RL agent learning, but generating effective self-generated goals remains challenging, especially for broad distributions of downstream tasks where zero-shot solving is infeasible.

Method: Combines a meta-learning framework for efficient multi-episode exploration with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that uses evolving estimates of post-adaptation performance to guide the training curriculum at the agent's capability frontier.

Result: On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, dynamics, and map structures, achieving superior zero-shot and few-shot performance while outperforming scratch learning, DIAYN, and alternative curricula.

Conclusion: ULEE provides a strong initialization for RL agents, effectively bridging pre-training and downstream task adaptation through curriculum-guided adversarial goal generation.

Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training can equip reinforcement learning agents with prior knowledge and accelerate learning in downstream tasks. A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures. The resulting policy attains improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, and provides a strong initialization for longer fine-tuning processes. It outperforms learning from scratch, DIAYN pre-training, and alternative curricula.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文构建了InfoNCE对比损失的测度论分析框架，揭示了其单峰与多峰机制间的根本几何分岔。单峰情况下损失景观严格凸且均匀性实为对齐盆地内的约束扩张，而多峰情形中持续存在的负对称散度项会驱动屏障协同适应，形成群体层面的模态间隙，从而将分析视角从逐点判别转向群体几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比学习中InfoNCE损失的几何机制在标准对齐-均匀性分解之外仍缺乏系统理解，制约了对表示学习动力学的原则性分析与控制。

Method: 提出测度论框架，将学习过程建模为嵌入流形上表示测度的演化；通过建立大batch极限下的值与梯度一致性，将随机目标桥接为显式确定性能量景观。

Result: 发现根本几何分岔：单峰机制产生严格凸景观与唯一Gibbs平衡，熵仅起"打破平局"作用，"均匀性"被澄清为对齐盆地内的约束扩张；而对称多峰目标包含持续负对称散度项，即使核锐化后仍存在，该项驱动屏障协同适应，将模态间隙从初始化假象提升为结构几何必要性。

Conclusion: 将分析视角从逐点判别转向群体几何，为诊断与控制对比学习中的分布失准提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: While InfoNCE powers modern contrastive learning, its geometric mechanisms remain under-characterized beyond the canonical alignment--uniformity decomposition. We present a measure-theoretic framework that models learning as the evolution of representation measures on a fixed embedding manifold. By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying "uniformity" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Grasynda, a novel graph-based data augmentation method for time series forecasting that converts time series into network structures and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for time series forecasting requires large datasets, but real-world scenarios often lack extensive data. Existing augmentation methods have limitations in preserving data properties.

Method: Grasynda converts univariate time series into a graph representation where each state is a node and transitions are directed edges, encoding temporal dynamics in a transition probability matrix to generate synthetic time series.

Result: Extensive evaluation on six benchmark datasets with three neural network variations shows Grasynda consistently outperforms other time series data augmentation methods, including those used in state-of-the-art foundation models.

Conclusion: Grasynda is an effective graph-based approach for time series data augmentation and the method with all experiments is publicly available.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial tool in time series forecasting, especially for deep learning architectures that require a large training sample size to generalize effectively. However, extensive datasets are not always available in real-world scenarios. Although many data augmentation methods exist, their limitations include the use of transformations that do not adequately preserve data properties. This paper introduces Grasynda, a novel graph-based approach for synthetic time series generation that: (1) converts univariate time series into a network structure using a graph representation, where each state is a node and each transition is represented as a directed edge; and (2) encodes their temporal dynamics in a transition probability matrix. We performed an extensive evaluation of Grasynda as a data augmentation method for time series forecasting. We use three neural network variations on six benchmark datasets. The results indicate that Grasynda consistently outperforms other time series data augmentation methods, including ones used in state-of-the-art time series foundation models. The method and all experiments are publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoPRo introduces a fine-tuning-free PTQ method using block-wise permutation, Walsh-Hadamard transformations, and R1SVD-based mixed-precision decomposition to achieve SOTA accuracy at 2-3 bit quantization for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current weight-only PTQ methods for sub-3-bit quantization suffer significant accuracy degradation and typically require fine-tuning. The challenges in quantizing residual matrices under low-rank approximation need better solutions.

Method: Proposes LoPRo, which applies block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance while preserving salient blocks, plus a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition using rank-1 sketch (R1SVD).

Result: Outperforms fine-tuning-free baselines at 2-3 bits, matches fine-tuning performance, achieves SOTA on LLaMA-2/3 with 4x speedup, and quantizes Mixtral-8x7B in 2.5h while improving accuracy by 8%.

Conclusion: LoPRo enables effective fine-tuning-free low-bit quantization with superior accuracy, efficiency, and minimal latency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables effective model compression while preserving relatively high accuracy. Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\%$\uparrow$. Moreover, compared to other low-rank quantization methods, LoPRo achieves superior accuracy with a significantly lower rank, while maintaining high inference efficiency and minimal additional latency.

*Yunyue Wei,Chenhui Zuo,Yanan Sui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Qflex is a reinforcement learning method that enables effective high-dimensional exploration by using value function gradients to guide a probability flow, outperforming baselines on complex control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional biological and robotic systems suffer from poor exploration in reinforcement learning due to expansive state-action spaces; existing methods either use undirected exploration that degrades with dimensionality or dimensionality reduction that sacrifices policy expressiveness.

Method: Qflex explores directly in native high-dimensional action space by traversing actions from a learnable source distribution along a probability flow induced by the learned value function, aligning exploration with task-relevant gradients instead of isotropic noise.

Result: The method substantially outperforms online RL baselines on diverse high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks and successfully controls a full-body human musculoskeletal model for agile movements, demonstrating superior scalability and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Value-guided flows offer a principled and practical route to exploration at scale, overcoming limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional systems in biological and robotic applications is challenging due to expansive state-action spaces, where effective exploration is critical. Commonly used exploration strategies in reinforcement learning are largely undirected with sharp degradation as action dimensionality grows. Many existing methods resort to dimensionality reduction, which constrains policy expressiveness and forfeits system flexibility. We introduce Q-guided Flow Exploration (Qflex), a scalable reinforcement learning method that conducts exploration directly in the native high-dimensional action space. During training, Qflex traverses actions from a learnable source distribution along a probability flow induced by the learned value function, aligning exploration with task-relevant gradients rather than isotropic noise. Our proposed method substantially outperforms representative online reinforcement learning baselines across diverse high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks. Qflex also successfully controls a full-body human musculoskeletal model to perform agile, complex movements, demonstrating superior scalability and sample efficiency in very high-dimensional settings. Our results indicate that value-guided flows offer a principled and practical route to exploration at scale.

TL;DR: 当前基于目标的Divisive层次聚类(DHC)方法因使用面向集合的二分评估标准，导致树状图缺失无不当分裂、相似聚类归组、真实对应性三属性；改用分布核可最大化簇总相似度(TSC)，解决该缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指出现有DHC方法生成的树状图缺乏无不当分裂、相似簇归组、与真实标签对应三属性，根源在于采用面向集合的二分评估标准

Method: 摒弃集合导向准则，引入分布核评估方式，提出以最大化所有簇总相似度(TSC)为新目标函数的DHC方法

Result: 理论证明新方法保证TSC下界；在人工和空间转录组学数据上验证有效，成功构建符合生物区域结构的树状图，而对比方法失败

Conclusion: 分布核方法有效解决DHC树状图属性缺失问题，特别适用于空间转录组学等生物信息学数据的层次聚类分析

Abstract: We uncover that current objective-based Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC) methods produce a dendrogram that does not have three desired properties i.e., no unwarranted splitting, group similar clusters into a same subset, ground-truth correspondence. This shortcoming has their root cause in using a set-oriented bisecting assessment criterion. We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC). Our theoretical analysis shows that the resultant dendrogram guarantees a lower bound of TSC. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed method on artificial and Spatial Transcriptomics (bioinformatics) datasets. Our proposed method successfully creates a dendrogram that is consistent with the biological regions in a Spatial Transcriptomics dataset, whereas other contenders fail.

TL;DR: 提出IRA算法，通过RDE、GAG和IPU加速在线强化学习的策略利用，改善探索和更新延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有价值型在线强化学习算法因探索效率低和策略更新延迟而策略利用缓慢。

Method: IRA算法采用Q-表示差异演化(RDE)学习表示，贪心动作引导(GAG)进行历史动作回溯的策略约束，以及即时策略更新(IPU)机制提高更新频率。

Result: 在八个MuJoCo连续控制任务上，IRA显著提高了学习效率和最终性能，并缓解了过估计偏差。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了在线强化学习的关键限制，实现了更快更好的性能。

Abstract: Existing value-based online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms suffer from slow policy exploitation due to ineffective exploration and delayed policy updates. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm called Instant Retrospect Action (IRA). Specifically, we propose Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE) to facilitate Q-network representation learning, enabling discriminative representations for neighboring state-action pairs. In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates. We further discover that the early-stage training conservatism of the IRA method can alleviate the overestimation bias problem in value-based RL. Experimental results show that IRA can significantly improve the learning efficiency and final performance of online RL algorithms on eight MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

TL;DR: This paper develops a general framework using truncation arguments and algorithmic stability to establish generalization bounds for stochastic optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise, and applies it to analyze clipped/normalized SGD and their variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While heavy-tailed gradient noise better characterizes real ML training than bounded variance noise, existing work focuses on optimization error convergence, leaving generalization bounds under heavy-tailed noise largely unexplored.

Method: Propose a general framework using truncation arguments to derive generalization error bounds based on algorithmic stability, assuming bounded pth centered moment (p∈(1,2]), and apply it to analyze clipped/normalized SGD and their mini-batch/momentum variants.

Result: Established stability and generalization bounds for several popular stochastic algorithms under heavy-tailed gradient noise conditions.

Conclusion: The framework fills a critical gap by providing the first comprehensive generalization analysis for heavy-tailed stochastic optimization, with applications to commonly used algorithms like clipped SGD.

Abstract: The empirical evidence indicates that stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed gradient noise is more appropriate to characterize the training of machine learning models than that with standard bounded gradient variance noise. Most existing works on this phenomenon focus on the convergence of optimization errors, while the analysis for generalization bounds under the heavy-tailed gradient noise remains limited. In this paper, we develop a general framework for establishing generalization bounds under heavy-tailed noise. Specifically, we introduce a truncation argument to achieve the generalization error bound based on the algorithmic stability under the assumption of bounded $p$th centered moment with $p\in(1,2]$. Building on this framework, we further provide the stability and generalization analysis for several popular stochastic algorithms under heavy-tailed noise, including clipped and normalized stochastic gradient descent, as well as their mini-batch and momentum variants.

### [116] [GraphDLG: Exploring Deep Leakage from Gradients in Federated Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19745)
*Shuyue Wei,Wantong Chen,Tongyu Wei,Chen Gong,Yongxin Tong,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes GraphDLG, a novel attack that recovers raw graph data from shared gradients in federated graph learning by first reconstructing the graph structure and then obtaining node features through a closed-form recursive rule, significantly outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While federated graph learning preserves privacy, the deep leakage from gradients (DLG) vulnerability remains underexplored for graph data. Graphs are uniquely challenging because their structure and node features are entangled in GNNs, making it unclear whether they can be effectively recovered from gradients.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze FGL components and discover that node features can be obtained via a closed-form recursive rule once the graph structure is recovered. Based on this, they propose GraphDLG which uses auxiliary graphs (randomly generated or client-side training graphs) to enhance the reconstruction of both graph structure and node features from shared gradients.

Result: Extensive experiments show GraphDLG successfully decouples graph structure and node features, achieving over 5.46% improvement in MSE for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% improvement in AUC for graph structure reconstruction compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that graph data is vulnerable to privacy attacks in federated learning settings, and the proposed GraphDLG method effectively recovers both structure and features from gradients, highlighting a critical privacy concern in FGL that needs to be addressed.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has recently emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed graph learning across multiple data owners. A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphDLG outperforms existing solutions by successfully decoupling the graph structure and node features, achieving improvements of over 5.46% (by MSE) for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% (by AUC) for graph structure reconstruction.

*Sixing Tan,Xianmin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes FedKACE, a streaming federated continual learning framework with adaptive model switching, gradient-balanced replay, and kernel spectral buffer maintenance to handle overlapping categories without task identifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing batch-based federated continual learning methods lack adaptability to streaming scenarios with category overlap between old and new data and absent task identifiers, causing knowledge confusion and uncertain task assignments.

Method: FedKACE introduces three key components: 1) adaptive inference model switching mechanism for personalization-generalization trade-off, 2) adaptive gradient-balanced replay scheme for overlapping-class scenarios, and 3) kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance to preserve high-information samples.

Result: Experiments across multiple scenarios and regret analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedKACE method.

Conclusion: The streaming FCL setting and FedKACE framework effectively address challenges of knowledge retention and acquisition in streaming federated learning with overlapping categories and no task identifiers.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) leverages inter-client collaboration to balance new knowledge acquisition and prior knowledge retention in non-stationary data. However, existing batch-based FCL methods lack adaptability to streaming scenarios featuring category overlap between old and new data and absent task identifiers, leading to indistinguishability of old and new knowledge, uncertain task assignments for samples, and knowledge confusion.To address this, we propose streaming federated continual learning setting: per federated learning (FL) round, clients process streaming data with disjoint samples and potentially overlapping categories without task identifiers, necessitating sustained inference capability for all prior categories after each FL round.Next, we introduce FedKACE: 1) an adaptive inference model switching mechanism that enables unidirectional switching from local model to global model to achieve a trade-off between personalization and generalization; 2) a adaptive gradient-balanced replay scheme that reconciles new knowledge learning and old knowledge retention under overlapping-class scenarios; 3) a kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance that preserves high-information and high-boundary-influence samples to optimize cross-round knowledge retention. Experiments across multiple scenarios and regret analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKACE.

*Michael Y. Hu,Jane Pan,Ayush Rajesh Jhaveri,Nicholas Lourie,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuNeu, a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation, achieves 2.04% MAE (38% better than logistic laws) by combining accuracy trajectories and token-level losses, generalizing zero-shot to unseen models/tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural scaling laws using aggregate metrics (e.g., validation loss) fail to capture diverse downstream task behaviors (monotonic improvement, plateau, degradation), and predicting performance from perplexity is limited by loss averaging obscuring signals and parametric families' inability to model full behavior spectrum.

Method: Proposed NeuNeu: a neural network treating scaling prediction as time-series extrapolation, combining observed accuracy trajectories (temporal context) and token-level validation losses to learn future performance without predefined functional forms, trained on HuggingFace open-source checkpoints.

Result: Achieved 2.04% mean absolute error (MAE) across 66 downstream tasks—38% lower than logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE)—with zero-shot generalization to unseen model families, parameter counts, and tasks.

Conclusion: Direct data-driven prediction of downstream scaling laws via neural networks (NeuNeu) outperforms parametric alternatives, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization without assuming functional forms.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws predict how language model performance improves with increased compute. While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE). Furthermore, NeuNeu generalizes zero-shot to unseen model families, parameter counts, and downstream tasks. Our work suggests that predicting downstream scaling laws directly from data outperforms parametric alternatives.

Motivation: 针对异常数据稀缺且标注成本高的问题，开发一种能够检测完全未知异常类别（OOD）的统一模型。

Method: 两阶段多向元学习框架：内层学习正常数据的流形结构（表示学习）；外层利用少量异常样本最大化正常样本（ID）与异常样本（OOD）之间的softmax置信度间隔（决策面校准）；通过多个以正常样本为主、少量异常样本为辅的episode进行迭代训练。

Result: 通过多向训练增强的两级优化，该方法能够更好地泛化到未见过的异常类别。

Conclusion: 所提出的多向元学习框架通过利用有限的异常数据学习鲁棒表示并校准决策边界，有效解决了类别泛化异常检测问题，实现了对未见异常类别的更好泛化能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the objective is to develop a unified model by focusing our learning on the available normal data and a small amount of anomaly data in order to detect the completely unseen anomalies, also referred to as the out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes.

Abstract: Villalobos et al. [2024] predict that publicly available human text will be exhausted within the next decade. Thus, improving models without access to ground-truth labels becomes increasingly important. We propose a label-free post-processing framework that improves a strong but miscalibrated model using a weaker yet better-calibrated reference. Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels. Experiments on representative LLMs across varying scales demonstrate that our label-free method significantly reduces proper losses and calibration errors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines.

Conclusion: 首次证明深度学习模型可从几何网格实时计算心血管瞬态血流动力学参数，为小样本生理流体力学问题提供通用解决方案，具备向其他心血管场景迁移的潜力。

Abstract: Extensive studies suggested that fluid mechanical markers of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can indicate disease progression risks, but to date this has not been translated clinically. This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.

Motivation: LLM scaling faces diminishing returns in width and context length extension, while depth scaling offers superior expressivity but current Transformers fail to train reliably at extreme depths due to instability issues in Post-LN architectures.

Method: Identifies gradient vanishing from ResNet-style residuals as Post-LN's failure mode, then replaces it with Highway-style connections to preserve gradient flow from top to bottom layers.

Result: Enables stable training beyond 1000 layers without special initialization or optimization tricks, consistently improving perplexity and depth-scaling over Pre-LN baselines.

Conclusion: Post-LN with Highway connections provides a simple foundation for deeply scalable LLMs, opening possibilities for infinite-depth architectures.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT)方法，通过模型自我蒸馏实现从演示中进行在线策略学习，在持续学习中优于监督微调，能显著减少灾难性遗忘


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习面临挑战：在线策略强化学习能减少遗忘但需要奖励函数，而主流的监督微调(off-policy)本质上是离线策略，容易导致灾难性遗忘

Method: 利用上下文学习，将演示条件下的模型作为自身教师，生成在线策略训练信号，在获取新技能的同时保持已有能力

Result: 在技能和知识获取任务中，SDFT持续优于SFT，新任务准确率更高，灾难性遗忘大幅减少；在顺序学习实验中，单模型能随时间积累多种技能而无性能下降

Conclusion: 在线策略蒸馏为从演示中实现持续学习提供了实用路径

Abstract: Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without degrading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models. While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations.

Conclusion: ENHSL机制成功解耦了本征态局域化与输运行为，建立了波动力学的新范式，为理解非厄米无序系统中的反常输运提供了理论基础和实验平台。

Abstract: Localization is a pervasive phenomenon across physics, shaping transport from electrons in solids to light and sound in engineered media. In traditional settings, disorder strongly impedes transport, resulting in dynamical localization or, at best, sub-ballistic or diffusive dynamics. A distinct and previously unobserved regime, erratic non-Hermitian skin localization (ENHSL), can arise in globally reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices with disorder. It features macroscopic, disorder-dependent localization at irregular bulk positions with subexponential decay, linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. We realize this regime experimentally in an acoustic lattice implementing a disordered Hatano-Nelson chain with imaginary gauge fields. Using Green's-function-based spectroscopy together with time-resolved measurements on the same platform, we reconstruct the full complex spectrum and eigenstates, and directly observe wave-packet dynamics. Remarkably, we observe ballistic transport despite strong spectral localization. We develop a transport theory that connects the dominant propagation site to the maximal random-walk excursion within an expanding light cone and predicts a universal Levy-arcsine statistics, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Our results decouple eigenstate localization from transport and establish ENHSL as a new paradigm for wave dynamics.

*Katsumasa Nakayama,Kei Suzuki*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper reveals that finite-size corrections in 1D spin chain ground-state energy (Ising/XY models) map directly to lattice fermionic Casimir effects via Jordan-Wigner transformation, identifying multiple Casimir phenomena types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a fundamental connection between finite-size corrections in spin systems and Casimir effects in their fermionic representations, enabling new interpretations of boundary phenomena in quantum magnets.

Method: Applied Jordan-Wigner transformation to map 1D transverse-field Ising and XY spin models to fermionic Hamiltonians, then analyzed finite-size scaling of ground-state energy to interpret corrections as lattice Casimir effects.

Result: All finite-size corrections in spin models correspond to fermionic Casimir effects: conventional (massless fields), damping (massive fields), vanishing (flat/non-relativistic bands), and oscillating (finite-density effects).

Conclusion: Created a direct dictionary linking spin-chain finite-size corrections to fermionic Casimir physics, providing experimentally accessible platforms (e.g., quantum simulators) to observe diverse Casimir phenomena in condensed matter systems.

Abstract: The Jordan-Wigner transformation connects spin operators in one-dimensional spin systems and fermionic operators. In this work, we elucidate the relationship between the finite-size corrections in the spin representation and the fermionic Casimir effect in the corresponding fermion representation. In particular, we focus on the ground-state energy of one-dimensional transverse-field Ising and XY models, and show that all finite-size corrections can be interpreted as lattice fermionic Casimir effects. We further find several types of Casimir phenomena, such as the conventional Casimir energy from massless fields, damping behavior from massive fields, vanishing behavior from flat or nonrelativistic bands, and oscillating behavior from the finite-density effect. Our findings establish a dictionary between finite-size corrections in spin chains and fermionic Casimir effects, and provide experimentally relevant platforms for the fermionic Casimir phenomena.

Result: 当两个子系统均临界时，一维系统出现临界指数ν随w连续变化的临界线；二维系统呈现量子多临界行为，对称性从Z₂⊕Z₂增强至连续O(2)对称性

Conclusion: 耦合量子Ising系统在临界条件下产生新颖的量子临界现象，包括临界指数连续变化和对称性增强，为理解量子多体系统的临界行为提供了新视角

Abstract: We analyze the quantum states of an isolated composite system consisting of two stacked quantum Ising (SQI) subsystems, coupled by a local Hamiltonian term that preserves the $Z_2$ symmetry of each subsystem. The coupling strength is controlled by an intercoupling parameter $w$, with $w=0$ corresponding to decoupled quantum Ising systems. We focus on the quantum correlations of one of the two SQI subsystems, $S$, in the ground state of the global system, and study their dependence on both the state of the weakly-coupled complementary part $E$ and the intercoupling strength. We concentrate on regimes in which $S$ develops critical long-range correlations. The most interesting physical scenario arises when both SQI subsystems are critical. In particular, for identical SQI subsystems, the global system is equivalent to the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, characterized by an additional $Z_2$ interchange symmetry between the two subsystem operators. In this limit, one-dimensional SQI systems exhibit a peculiar critical line along which the length-scale critical exponent $ν$ varies continuously with $w$, while two-dimensional systems develop quantum multicritical behaviors characterized by an effective enlargement of the symmetry of the critical modes, from the actual $Z_2\oplus Z_2$ symmetry to a continuous O(2) symmetry.

Conclusion: 为理解莫尔调制磁纹理提供了基于几何能量学的最小理论框架，证明其源于基本能量平衡而非热力学相变

Abstract: Moiré patterns in magnetic bilayers generate spatially modulated interlayer exchange interactions that can give rise to nonuniform magnetic textures. We study a minimal classical bilayer Ising model with a moiré-modulated interlayer coupling, generated either by relative twist or differential strain between the layers. Using large-scale classical Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the ordering transition remains in the conventional two-dimensional Ising universality class, even when the low-temperature state is domain-textured. At low temperatures, we find a smooth crossover between a uniform ferromagnet and domain-textured state, in which the spins locally follow the sign of the interlayer exchange. We demonstrate that there is no breaking of layer symmetry for twisted bilayers. The location of the crossover is determined by a simple geometric energy balance between bulk interlayer exchange and intralayer domain-wall costs. Our results provide a minimal framework for understanding how moiré-modulated magnetic textures can emerge from geometric energetics without requiring a thermodynamic phase transition.

Motivation: 挑战P vs NP问题的传统二元对立观点，主张NP完全问题的解空间可能存在结构性分区，不同区域具有截然不同的计算复杂性特征

Method: 以Wang铺砖问题为模型，引入统计物理学启发式方法定义"良好字母表"（热力学行为良好）和"不良字母表"，分别为其构建多项式时间算法或分析混沌行为

Result: 对良好字母表成功构造多项式时间铺砖算法；对不良字母表观察到类似混沌动力系统的计算复杂性；暗示所有NP完全问题可能共享此三区域结构模式

Conclusion: P vs NP问题可能存在普适的细粒度结构，其解空间的分区特性（可解区/混沌区/边缘区）或成为理解计算复杂性本质的新范式

Abstract: We introduce the idea that the P vs NP problem can have a finer structure. Given the NP complete problem of interest, the configurations space of the problem can be divided in (at least) two regions. In one region, polynomial algorithms to solve the NP complete problem of interest are available (and we discuss one possible realization inspire by the games of chess and go). In the second region the problem to find polynomial time algorithms is very similar to the problem to find polynomial time algorithms to determine the asymptotic behavior of discrete dynamical systems in the chaotic regime. We cannot exclude the existence of a third region which separates the first two: this region would have the characteristics of the edge of chaos. We focuss on the Wang tiling problem of an N X N square (with N large): here a Wang tiles set Gamma is an alphabet. We construct a statistical-physics inspired heuristic which allows to define good alphabets as the ones with a good thermodynamical behavior. For (a suitable subclass of) good alphabets we construct an algortihm which, in polynomial time, determines how to tile the N x N square. On the other hand, for bad alphabets, we observe a chaotic behavior. The Cook-Levin theorem advocate a similar pattern for all the NP-complete problems.

TL;DR: 提出通过lifting方法将不可逆性引入多正则蒙特卡洛模拟，显著加速了二维伊辛模型和Edwards-Anderson自旋玻璃的基态搜索，相比传统方法实现2-4倍至数量级的加速效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统平坦直方图蒙特卡洛模拟在统计物理中用于基态搜索和相变研究，但存在两个关键局限：1) 达到平坦分布所需时间未知且难以预估；2) 模拟末期因随机游走扩散特性导致效率下降

Method: 采用lifting技术将不可逆性引入多正则蒙特卡洛方法，通过打破细致平衡条件来优化随机游走路径，减少返回基态的时间间隔

Result: 在二维伊辛模型中实现2-4倍加速；在Edwards-Anderson自旋玻璃中达到最高10倍加速；往返基态时间分布更窄且显著缩短，表明收敛时间降低且时间方差减小

Conclusion: 不可逆性引入为多正则采样提供了高效加速方案，能有效解决传统方法末期效率下降问题，为复杂系统基态搜索提供了更优的收敛性能与稳定性

Abstract: Flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations are well-established, robust methods to perform random walks in a physical observable or parameter space, making them suitable for finding ground states or studying phase transitions in complex systems in statistical physics. However, their efficiency can be limited by the time to attain the desired flat distribution, which is generally unknown prior to the simulations. In particular, they might suffer from slowing down towards the end of a simulation due to the diffusive nature of random walks. In this work we apply irreversibility to the multicanonical Monte Carlo method via the lifting approach to alleviate this behavior. We achieve a 2-4 times speedup in ground-state search for a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model, and up to an order of magnitude of speedup for finding the ground-state energy in an Edwards-Anderson spin glass, compared to traditional multicanonical sampling. The round-trip times between ground states show a narrower distribution and are significantly shorter compared to the reversible counterpart, suggesting that a lower convergence time with a smaller time variance is feasible.

Motivation: 三维自旋玻璃在磁场中是否存在de Almeida-Thouless(dAT)相变仍是统计物理重大未解问题，传统分析方法受重叠分布宽尾效应影响而难以得出明确结论

Method: 开发抗宽尾干扰的新自旋玻璃磁化率计算方法，应用于二维/三维Edwards-Anderson自旋玻璃模型，并与三维Ising模型(无无序)及平均场模型对比分析

Result: 发现磁化率极值点在磁场-温度平面呈现方向性差异：Ising和二维自旋玻璃向右弯曲(超临界交叉线)，平均场和三维自旋玻璃向左弯曲(dAT线特征)；三维体系在磁场中磁化率随系统尺寸发散，而二维体系趋于饱和

Conclusion: 为三维自旋玻璃在磁场中的dAT相变提供直接数值证据，支持复本对称破缺理论框架，解决了该领域长期争议

Abstract: The nature of spin-glass states in a magnetic field remains a major open problem in statistical physics. The existence of the de Almeida-Thouless (dAT) transition for three-dimensional (3D) spin glasses in a field is still debated. We introduce a new computational method to define the spin-glass susceptibility, which is robust against the broad tail in the overlap distribution that undermines conventional analyses. Applying this approach to the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model in 2D and 3D, and contrasting with the 3D Ising (without disorder) and mean-field spin-glass models, we find a stark difference: the locus of susceptibility maxima bends to the right in the field-temperature plane for the Ising and 2D spin-glass cases, indicating a supercritical crossover line, but bends to the left for the mean-field and 3D spin glasses - a signature of the dAT line. Finite-size scaling further suggests that the peak susceptibility diverges with system size in 3D spin glasses under a field, while saturating in 2D. These results provide direct numerical evidence for the dAT transition in 3D, supporting the replica symmetry breaking scenario.

Result: 弱非线性下轨迹位于64维相空间的2维非线性流形；β=1.1时维度增至3维，对应偶数波数模式激发的对称性破缺转变；PCA无法捕捉数据内在结构。

Conclusion: 深度自编码器有效揭示非线性系统内在维度，而线性PCA方法在此存在局限。

Abstract: We address the intrinsic dimensionality (ID) of high-dimensional trajectories, comprising $n_s = 4\,000\,000$ data points, of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) $β$ model with $N = 32$ oscillators. To this end, a deep autoencoder (DAE) model is employed to infer the ID in the weakly nonlinear regime ($β\lesssim 1$). We find that the trajectories lie on a nonlinear manifold of dimension $m^{\ast} = 2$ embedded in a $64$-dimensional phase space. The DAE further reveals that this dimensionality increases to $m^{\ast} = 3$ at $β= 1.1$, coinciding with a symmetry breaking transition, in which additional energy modes with even wave numbers $k = 2, 4$ become excited. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the linear approach based on principal component analysis (PCA), which fails to capture the underlying structure of the data and therefore yields unreliable results in most cases.

Conclusion: 动态无序可显著改变输运性质，在快波动极限下恢复类退火行为，为理解复杂系统中能量景观动态性对扩散的影响提供普适理论框架

Abstract: Established theoretical studies of diffusion in rugged (or rough) potential surfaces have largely focused on quenched energy landscapes. Here we study diffusion on a rugged energy landscape in the presence of dynamic disorder, a situation relevant to a wide range of disordered systems, including glasses, disordered solids, and biomolecular transport. For static (quenched) Gaussian disorder, Zwanzig derived a compact mean field expression for the diffusion constant, showing that increasing ruggedness leads to a sharp reduction of diffusive transport. Subsequent work demonstrated that in one-dimensional discrete lattices diffusion is further suppressed by rare but long-lived multi-site traps that lie beyond the mean-field description. In many physical systems, however, the local energy landscape is not frozen but fluctuates in time, there by modifying trap lifetimes and transport properties. In this work we develop a minimal, analytically tractable theory of diffusion on rugged energy landscapes with dynamic disorder by allowing site or barrier energies to fluctuate as dichotomic (telegraph) processes with given amplitude and flipping rate. Using a Kehr type formulation appropriate for discrete hopping processes, we derive an analytic expression for the diffusion constant in terms of mean waiting times. We show that dynamic disorder induces a continuous crossover from quasi-quenched, trap-dominated transport to an annealed, motional narrowing regime as the fluctuation rate increases. Explicit numerical calculations confirm this crossover, interpolating between rare-event-dominated diffusion and Zwanzig mean-field regime.

Abstract: We investigate the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice, featuring first- and second-neighbor ferromagnetic couplings ($J_1>0$ and $J_2>0$) and third-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions ($J_3<0$). Using the cluster mean-field method, we analyze the phase transitions in the regime $1/2 < J_2/J_1 \le 1$, where ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases compete. Our results reveal that near the strongly frustrated limit $J_3/J_1 = -1$, the system exhibits order-by-disorder state selection, tricritical and bicritical behavior, critical endpoints, and two successive phase transitions. The ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition remains second order across the entire interaction range, whereas the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic boundary shows a richer behavior, including both first- and second-order transitions as well as tricriticality. Increasing the second-neighbor coupling $J_2/J_1$ narrows the range of $J_3/J_1$ where first-order antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions occur; beyond a certain threshold, only second-order order-disorder transitions persist. Consequently, the tricritical point shifts toward $J_3/J_1 \approx -1$ as $J_2/J_1$ increases, culminating in a bicritical point where the antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and paramagnetic phases meet.

Conclusion: 有限温度可作为调节器在连续场论中恢复反常输运，非可积系统低温下仍通过类孤子激发维持反常动力学行为

Abstract: Anomalous KPZ spin transport is well established in integrable non-Abelian lattice models but has not been investigated in continuum field theories as discretization in numerics generally break the continuum theory's integrability. We show that finite temperature acts as a regulator that can restore anomalous transport over a broad time window. In a family of spin field theories labeled by integer $n$, the $n = 1$ case is the Landau-Lifshitz model, whose numerical data shows spin superdiffusion with Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling and, at lower temperature ballistic energy transport, whereas both observables are diffusive at high temperature. The non-integrable $n = 2$ case shows the same crossover. While Lyapunov analysis confirms the model's non-integrability, the structure of spin-density space-time profiles suggests that long-lived soliton-like trajectories exist at low temperature.

Conclusion: 这种无需显式建模的交替式检测策略在原子检测任务中表现出优越性，特别是在非理想光学条件下具有更高的准确性和鲁棒性，为微阱阵列的原子检测提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Building on top of our recent work [arXiv:2502.08511], we introduce a new strategy to solve the problem of detecting atoms in high-resolution images of microtrap arrays. By alternating estimation and detection steps, we get rid of the need for an explicit model to compute the posterior occupancy probability of each site given its a priori optimal estimate. As direct benefits, we show an improved detection accuracy compared to our previous work when the sites are not optically well resolved, and we expect a greater robustness against real experimental conditions.

### [137] [Interaction-Conditional Semantics and the Dissolution of Quantum Paradoxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18810)
*Jonathon Sendall*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 这篇论文认为量子力学中的多个经典谜题源于将测量条件结果错误地提升为固有属性的语义错误，提出四个只允许构型相对断言的原则，通过测量几何而非新物理解释这些谜题，并重新诠释贝尔和科亨-斯佩克定理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子力学中的多个经典谜题（包括自旋测量、双缝实验、纠缠关联和维格纳的朋友）具有共同起源：语义错误，即非法将相互作用条件结果提升为固有属性。

Method: 引入四个原则，这些原则只允许构型相对断言，将结果建立在物理测量几何基础上，同时保持客观性。

Result: 统一应用这些原则可以消解每个谜题，无需新物理或特设性解释机制；贝尔定理和科亨-斯佩克定理被重新理解为对可允许解释结构的约束，而非动力学谜团，证明固有结果语义与经验现实不兼容。

Conclusion: 得到一种关系性客观性，既避免了朴素属性实在论，也避免了观察者主观主义。

Abstract: This paper argues that several canonical puzzles in quantum mechanics, including spin measurement, the double slit, entanglement correlations, and Wigner's friend, share a common origin in a semantic error and the illicit promotion of interaction conditional outcomes to intrinsic properties. I introduce four principles that license only configuration relative predication, grounding outcomes in physical measurement geometry while preserving objectivity. Applying these principles uniformly dissolves each puzzle without new physics or ad hoc interpretive machinery. Bell's theorem and the Kochen-Specker theorem are reframed not as dynamical mysteries but as constraints on permissible explanatory structure, evidence that intrinsic-outcome semantics is incompatible with empirical reality. The result is a relational objectivity that avoids both naive property realism and observer subjectivism.

Motivation: 探究能量期望值约束下的随机量子态是否会出现本征态凝聚现象，以及在有限维系统中该现象的相结构特征。

Method: 分析有限维希尔伯特空间中受能量约束的Haar随机量子态，通过重叠度统计特性识别不同相区。

Result: 发现三个相：1) 基态相（能量低于临界值E_c时与基态宏观重叠）；2) 高温相（与所有本征态指数小重叠）；3) 反基态相（与最高激发态宏观重叠）。在局域自旋系统中，基态/反基态相向谱中部趋近于1/系统尺寸，但相变具有指数型有限尺寸标度。

Conclusion: 能量约束随机态在有限维系统中存在尖锐的相变，高温相实为扩展相，其指数标度行为区别于多项式标度体系。

Abstract: Random quantum states drawn from the Haar ensemble with a constraint on the energy expectation value $E_{\mathrm{av}} = \langle ψ| H | ψ\rangle$ display \textit{eigenstate condensation}: for $E_{\mathrm{av}}$ below a critical value $E_c$, they develop macroscopic overlap with the ground state. We study eigenstate condensation in systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. These systems display three phases: a ground-state phase, in which energy-constrained random states have macroscopic overlap with the ground state; a high-temperature phase, in which they have exponentially small overlap with each energy eigenstate; and an anti-ground-state phase, in which they have macroscopic overlap with the most highly excited state. In local spin systems the ground-state and anti-ground-state phases approach the middle of the spectrum as $1/[\text{system size}]$, but -- because the condensation phase transitions have exponential, rather than polynomial, finite-size scaling -- the crossover becomes exponentially sharp in system size and the high-temperature phase is best understood as an extended phase.

Conclusion: 该框架为混合量子-经典工作流中的自适应算法选择提供基础，推动VQA在NISQ设备上的可靠应用

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising methods for solving combinatorial optimization problems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, benchmarking VQAs is difficult due to their stochastic behavior and the lack of standardized performance criteria. This work introduces a general framework for evaluating VQAs applied to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. The framework uses three complementary metrics: feasibility, quality, and reproducibility. It also introduces a quality diagram that visualizes trade-offs between success probability and computational resources. Reproducibility is formalized using Shannon entropy, and a decision rule is defined for selecting algorithms under resource constraints. As a demonstration, the framework is applied to several VQAs using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) cost functions and different shot counts on a 16-qubit QUBO instance. The results show how the framework supports systematic benchmarking and provides a foundation for adaptive algorithm selection in hybrid quantum-classical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary angiography interpretation is highly operator-dependent, and conventional deep learning models struggle with complex vascular morphology and fine-grained texture patterns, limiting their clinical utility.

Method: The authors propose LQER, a hybrid quantum-classical architecture using a pretrained ResNet18 as feature extractor, enhanced by a parameterized quantum circuit with data re-uploading and entanglement at high-level semantic feature space, followed by residual fusion with classical features for end-to-end optimization.

Result: LQER outperformed the classical ResNet18 baseline across accuracy, AUC, and F1-score metrics, achieving >90% test accuracy, with particularly improved discrimination of positive lesions under class-imbalanced conditions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a practical hybrid quantum-classical learning paradigm for coronary angiography analysis, offering a viable pathway for deploying quantum machine learning in real-world medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Background: Coronary angiography (CAG) is the cornerstone imaging modality for evaluating coronary artery stenosis and guiding interventional decision-making. However, interpretation based on single-frame angiographic images remains highly operator-dependent, and conventional deep learning models still face challenges in modeling complex vascular morphology and fine-grained texture patterns.Methods: We propose a Lightweight Quantum-Enhanced ResNet (LQER) for binary classification of coronary angiography images. A pretrained ResNet18 is employed as a classical feature extractor, while a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is introduced at the high-level semantic feature space for quantum feature enhancement. The quantum module utilizes data re-uploading and entanglement structures, followed by residual fusion with classical features, enabling end-to-end hybrid optimization with a strictly controlled number of qubits.Results: On an independent test set, the proposed LQER outperformed the classical ResNet18 baseline in accuracy, AUC, and F1-score, achieving a test accuracy exceeding 90%. The results demonstrate that lightweight quantum feature enhancement improves discrimination of positive lesions, particularly under class-imbalanced conditions.Conclusion: This study validates a practical hybrid quantum--classical learning paradigm for coronary angiography analysis, providing a feasible pathway for deploying quantum machine learning in medical imaging applications.

Conclusion: 提供模型无关的非马尔可夫性相图分类方法，揭示记忆效应源于隐藏自由度信息回流，边界由核函数数学特性决定

Abstract: Memory effects in non-Markovian dynamics are often diagnosed either via quantum-correlation revivals or via non-monotonic classical information measures, yet a unified minimal framework comparing their ``backflow phases'' is still lacking. Here we propose an information-backflow phase-diagram approach that places \emph{quantum entanglement revivals} and \emph{classical entropy overshoots} on the same footing through a common backflow functional $N_I=\int_{\dot I>0}\dot I\,dt$. On the quantum side, we employ a fractional (Caputo) extension of a two-state dissipative model embedded by thermo-field dynamics (TFD), yielding a closed-form intrinsic entanglement component $b^{(α)}_{qe}(t)=\frac14[E_α(-λ^αt^α)]^2\sin^2(ωt)$ and an integrated revival measure $N_{qe}$ that delineates a sharp boundary near $α\simeq 1/2$ in the $(α,ω/λ)$ plane. On the classical side, we consider a three-state model whose Markov generator is promoted either to an exponential-kernel generalized master equation (with exact Markov embedding) or to a semi-Markov process with Erlang-2 waiting times. We quantify non-monotonicity by the entropy overshoot $ΔH$ and KL-based diagnostics on the probability simplex. To strengthen the quantum--classical symmetry, we further introduce a \emph{fractional Mittag--Leffler memory kernel} in the classical dynamics and show that an analogous backflow transition emerges around $α\simeq 1/2$, indicating that the boundary originates from the kernel's mathematical structure rather than from quantumness per se. Overall, our results provide a compact, model-agnostic route to classify non-Markovianity by phase diagrams of information backflow and to interpret them via a shared embedding narrative: memory stored in hidden degrees of freedom returns to the observed sector as non-monotonic information flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了建立普朗克尺度时空离散性(通过广义双狭义相对论描述)下零自旋粒子相对论量子动力学的一致性一阶哈密顿量表述，解决传统二阶克莱因-戈登方程在散射问题中的困难，并量化普朗克尺度形变的物理效应。

Method: 从G-DSR的通用非线性动量空间映射出发，推导普朗克长度一阶修正的修正色散关系，构建形变克莱因-戈登算符的σ₃-伪厄米FV线性化哈密顿量，并利用守恒的FV流定义反射和透射系数。

Result: 对于一维克莱因-戈登振子，获得可控的普朗克尺度能谱移动，揭示动能壳形变与质量壳形变对能级间距和高能谱压缩的不同影响；对于静电阶跃和势垒散射，直接从伪厄米FV流计算反射和透射系数，量化形变导致的超临界(对产生)阈值的移动。

Conclusion: FV框架为研究普朗克尺度效应对相对论量子动力学的影响提供了有效方法，不同DSR实现(Amelino-Camelia与Magueijo-Smolin)会产生可区分的物理预测，特别是MS型形变在有效域(lₚE≪1)内会推迟超临界态的出现并减小负透射流强度。

Abstract: We develop a first-order Feshbach-Villars (FV) Hamiltonian framework for spin-0 relativistic quantum dynamics in the presence of Planck-scale kinematic deformations described within generalized doubly special relativity (G-DSR). Starting from a generic nonlinear momentum-space map, we derive the corresponding modified dispersion relation (MDR) at leading order in the Planck length \(l_p\) and construct a consistent FV linearization of the deformed Klein-Gordon operator. The resulting two-component Hamiltonian remains \(σ_3\)-pseudo-Hermitian at \(\mathcal{O}(l_p)\), which guarantees conservation of the FV charge and current and provides a current-based definition of reflection and transmission in stationary scattering.
  As applications, we study two benchmark settings in which the FV metric structure is essential: (i) the one-dimensional Klein-Gordon oscillator and (ii) scattering from electrostatic step and barrier potentials. For the oscillator, we obtain controlled \(\mathcal{O}(l_p)\) branch-resolved spectral shifts and show how kinetic versus mass-shell deformations reshape the level spacing and the high-energy spectral compression. For step and barrier scattering, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients directly from the pseudo-Hermitian FV current and quantify the deformation-induced shift of the supercritical (pair-production) threshold. A comparative analysis of the Amelino-Camelia and Magueijo-Smolin realizations indicates that MS-type deformations generally delay the onset of the supercritical regime and reduce the magnitude of the negative transmitted flux within the validity domain \(l_p E \ll 1\).

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a digital quantum simulation framework for strongly correlated fermionic systems, specifically studying the Fermi polaron and BEC-BCS crossover. Using a unified Hamiltonian mapped to quantum hardware via Jordan-Wigner transformation and Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, they implement Ramsey interferometry to extract dynamics. The simulation successfully captures the transition from polaron to molecular bound state with linear energy renormalization, validated against classical benchmarks and executed on real quantum hardware, showing resilience to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The simulation of strongly correlated fermionic systems remains a major computational physics challenge due to exponential Hilbert space growth and the fermionic sign problem. The research aims to comprehensively explore two important phenomena—Fermi polaron (impurity physics) and BEC-BCS crossover (pairing superfluidity)—that are difficult to study with classical methods.

Method: The authors develop a unified Hamiltonian formalism bridging pairing superfluidity and impurity physics. The system is mapped to a gate-based quantum processor using Jordan-Wigner transformation. Time evolution is implemented via first-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. A Ramsey interferometry protocol extracts real-time dynamics and spectral response. A hybrid variational approach is employed to mitigate quantum hardware noise.

Result: The simulation demonstrates a smooth transition from a dressed quasiparticle (polaron) regime to a stable molecular bound state, characterized by linear energy renormalization in the strong-coupling limit. Results are validated against exact classical benchmarks and successfully executed on Barcelona Supercomputing Center quantum hardware. The hybrid variational approach shows remarkable resilience to noise, accurately capturing the bifurcation of the spectral density.

Conclusion: This work establishes a viable digital quantum simulation framework for strongly correlated fermionic systems, successfully bridging impurity physics and pairing superfluidity. The demonstrated resilience of the hybrid variational approach to hardware noise suggests practical applicability of near-term quantum devices for quantum many-body problems, opening new pathways for studying strongly correlated physics beyond classical computational limits.

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The preferred-basis problem and the definite-outcome aspect of the measurement problem persist even if the detector is modeled unitarily, because experimental data are necessarily represented in a Boolean event algebra of mutually exclusive records whereas the theoretical description is naturally formulated in a noncommutative operator algebra with continuous unitary symmetry. This change of mathematical type constitutes the core of the 'cut': a structurally necessary interface from group-based kinematics to set-based counting. In the presented view the basis relevant for recorded outcomes is not determined by the system Hamiltonian alone; it is induced by the measurement mapping, i.e., by the detector channel together with the coarse-grained readout that defines an instrument. The probabilistic mapping is anchored in symmetry and measure theory: by Gleason-type uniqueness (Gleason for projections in $d>2$ and Busch's extension for Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs) including $d=2$), the trace rule is the unique probability measure consistent with additivity over exclusive events and basis-independence of the unitary sector. A compact qubit--pointer model yields an induced unsharp POVM $E_\pm=\tfrac12(\id\pm η\,σ_z)$ with $η$ fixed by pointer resolution, displaying explicitly how the detector induces the relevant basis. Finally, nested-observer paradoxes are tightened into a non-composability lemma: joint assignment of outcome propositions is obstructed unless a joint instrument exists. This relocates the origin of randomness to the stochasticity of the transition rules.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce post-selection games, a generalization of nonlocal games where each round can be not only won or lost by the players, but also discarded by the referee. Such games naturally formalize possibilistic proofs of nonlocality, such as Hardy's paradox. We develop algorithms for computing the local and Tsirelson bounds of post-selection games. Furthermore, we show that they have an unbounded advantage in statistical power over traditional nonlocal games, making them ideally suited for analysing Bell tests with low detection efficiency.

Abstract: The canonical commutation relation is a cornerstone of quantum theory and underlies the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Although uncertainty relations have been extensively tested, direct verifications of the underlying commutation relation itself have remained elusive. We report an experimental demonstration of the bosonic commutation relation for optical field operators based on measurements of two distinct intensity correlation functions. From these measurements, we extract the expectation value of the field-operator commutator for both a single-photon state and coherent state. In both cases, the measured values are consistent with unity, in quantitative agreement with quantum theory.

Motivation: Quantum technology faces complex optimization and control problems that can be effectively tackled using reinforcement learning's adaptive decision-making capabilities through interaction with quantum devices.

Method: Comprehensive survey of recent progress in RL applications across quantum systems, including state preparation, quantum gate optimization, circuit design, feedback control, and error correction, with experimental implementations highlighted.

Conclusion: Despite promising advances, RL in quantum technology faces open challenges in scalability, interpretability, and experimental integration; future research should focus on overcoming these barriers to fully leverage RL for quantum device development.

Abstract: Many challenges arising in Quantum Technology can be successfully addressed using a set of machine learning algorithms collectively known as reinforcement learning (RL), based on adaptive decision-making through interaction with the quantum device. After a concise and intuitive introduction to RL aimed at a broad physics readership, we discuss the key ideas and core concepts in reinforcement learning with a particular focus on quantum systems. We then survey recent progress in RL in all relevant areas. We discuss state preparation in few- and many-body quantum systems, the design and optimization of high-fidelity quantum gates, and the automated construction of quantum circuits, including applications to variational quantum eigensolvers and architecture search. We further highlight the interactive capabilities of RL agents, emphasizing recent progress in quantum feedback control and quantum error correction, and briefly discuss quantum reinforcement learning as well as applications to quantum metrology. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges -- such as scalability, interpretability, and integration with experimental platforms -- and outlines promising directions for future research. Throughout, we highlight experimental implementations that exemplify the increasing role of reinforcement learning in shaping the development of quantum technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子态可通过测量结果概率向量表示，这种表示在量子场论和量子基础中广泛应用。但为了保证操作意义，这种表示必须具有拓扑鲁棒性（保持态之间的接近性），而尚不清楚这种鲁棒性是否与其他量子结构兼容。

Method: 通过概念分析识别量子态概率表示中拓扑鲁棒性与结构保留之间的根本性冲突，揭示其内在不兼容性。

Result: 发现拓扑鲁棒的概率表示无法同时保留子系统结构等基本量子特征，存在不可避免的张力。

Conclusion: 这表明在量子态的操作表示中存在根本性限制：必须在操作意义（拓扑鲁棒性）与结构完整性（子系统特征）之间做出权衡。

Abstract: The state $ρ$ of a quantum system can be represented by a vector $\mathbf{P}_{\mathcal{M}}(ρ)$ of outcome probabilities for a set of measurements $\mathcal{M}$. Such representations appear throughout physics, for example, in quantum field theory via correlation functions and in quantum foundations within generalized probabilistic frameworks. In this work, we identify an unavoidable tension: to enable operationally meaningful statements, the map ${ρ\mapsto \mathbf{P}_{\mathcal{M}}(ρ)}$ must be topologically robust $\unicode{x2013}$ preserving the notion of closeness between states. Yet, a probability representation that is topologically robust cannot simultaneously retain other essential structure, such as the subsystem structure.

Abstract: Using the framework of decoherent histories, we study which past events leave detectable records in isolated quantum systems under the realistic assumption that decoherence is approximate and not perfect. In the first part we establish -- asymptotically for a large class of (pseudo-)random histories -- that the number of reliable records can be much smaller than the number of possible events, depending on the degree of decoherence. In the second part we reveal a clear decoherence structure for long histories based on a numerically exact solution of a random matrix model that, as we argue, captures generic aspects of decoherence. We observe recoherence between histories with a small Hamming distance, for localized histories admitting a high purity Petz recovery state, and for maverick histories that are statistical outliers with respect to Born's rule. From the perspective of the Many Worlds Interpretation, the first part -- which views the self-location problem as a coherent version of quantum state discrimination -- reveals a "branch selection problem", and the second part sheds light on the emergence of Born's rule and the theory confirmation problem.

Abstract: We introduce multivariate multicycle (MM) codes, a new family of quantum error correcting codes that unifies and generalizes bivariate bicycle codes, multivariate bicycle codes, abelian two-block group algebra codes, generalized bicycle codes, trivariate tricycle codes, and n-dimensional toric codes. MM codes are Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes defined from length-t chain complexes with $t \ge 4$. The chief advantage of these codes is that they possess metachecks and high confinement that permit complete single-shot decoding, while also having additional algebraic structure that might enable logical non-Clifford gates. We offer a framework that facilitates the construction of long-length chain complexes through the use of Koszul complex. In particular, obtaining explicit boundary maps (parity check and metacheck matrices) is particularly straightforward in our approach. This simple but very general parameterization of codes permitted us to efficiently perform a numerical search, where we identify several MM code candidates that demonstrate these capabilities at high rates and high code distances. Examples of new codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ include $[[96, 12, 8]]$, $[[96, 44, 4]]$ $[[144, 40, 4]]$, $[[216, 12, 12]]$, $[[360, 30, 6]]$, $[[384, 80, 4]]$, $[[486, 24, 12]]$, $[[486, 66, 9]]$ and $[[648, 60, 9]]$. Notably, our codes achieve confinement profiles that surpass all known single-shot decodable quantum CSS codes of practical blocksize.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种三谐振腔结构（一主动增益腔+两被动耗散腔），通过破坏性干涉使输入耦合腔内光场完全抵消，实现任意功率和耦合强度下的完全透明，并可独立调控透明窗口和输出光强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电磁感应透明（EIT）在原子介质或光学谐振腔中需苛刻实验条件才能实现近100%透射，受限于介质特性。

Method: 构建三个线性耦合谐振腔，其中一个腔可承载任意光学增益（主动腔），另两个仅具耗散（被动腔）。通过调节腔间耦合，使直接耦合输入的谐振腔内光场发生破坏性干涉而完全湮灭，从而实现完全透明。

Result: 该透明机制可在任意可行透射功率和所有可实现的耦合强度下工作，只要其余两腔间的耦合可在适当范围调节。通过调谐两个腔间耦合，无需改变系统固有参数即可自由控制透明窗口尺寸和输出光场强度。

Conclusion: 该方案突破传统EIT对实验条件的严格限制，提供了一种鲁棒且高度可控的透明机制，具有显著的设计灵活性和实用价值。

Abstract: The phenomena of induced transparency, with the typical examples of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic media and coupled optical resonators, have attracted tremendous interest since their discoveries. Due to the limitations of the involved elements, however, near-100\% transmissions were reported under highly demanding experimental conditions for atomic and other media. Based on a structure of three linearly coupled optical resonators, an active one carrying a possibly arbitrary optical gain and two passive ones simply with dissipation, we demonstrate that a transmitted light field can become completely transparent through the structure, which displays all properties similar to those of EIT. Manifested by a destructive interference to annihilate the intracavity field in the resonator directly coupled to the input, this complete transparency exists for any feasible power of the transmitted field and all realizable coupling strengths of the dark resonator with the input and the neighboring resonator, as long as the inter-cavity coupling for two other resonators is adjustable over a suitable range. A free control on the transparency window size and output field intensity can be realized by tuning two inter-cavity couplings without modifying the built-in system parameters.

Motivation: 理解不同复杂度度量在量子动力学中的物理意义，探索状态复杂度与信息几何复杂度是否反映量子演化的不同方面

Method: 将Krylov复杂度几何化表述（瞬时与时间平均），并与基于效率与曲率的信息几何复杂度对比，分析Bloch球面上测地线与非测地线轨迹

Result: Krylov复杂度量化演化态相对于初态的方向扩散，而信息几何复杂度刻画轨迹在Bloch球面上探索的有效体积，二者行为不等价

Conclusion: 两类复杂度反映量子动力学的根本不同层面，状态基与信息几何复杂度在量子系统中具有互补性

Abstract: We compare Krylov's state complexity with an information-geometric (IG) measure of complexity for the quantum evolution of two-level systems. Focusing on qubit dynamics on the Bloch sphere, we analyze evolutions generated by stationary and nonstationary Hamiltonians, corresponding to geodesic and nongeodesic trajectories. We formulate Krylov complexity in geometric terms, both instantaneously and in a time-averaged sense, and contrast it with an IG complexity of quantum evolutions characterized in terms of efficiency and curvature. We show that the two measures reflect fundamentally different aspects of quantum dynamics: Krylov's state complexity quantifies the directional spread of the evolving state relative to the initial state, whereas the IG complexity captures the effective volume explored along the trajectory on the Bloch sphere. This geometric distinction explains their inequivalent behavior and highlights the complementary nature of state-based and information-geometric notions of complexity in quantum systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces zero-knowledge position verification, enabling entities to prove complex location statements (like alibis) while keeping other location details private, constructed from quantum position verification and post-quantum one-way functions using position commitments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional position verification only proves current location, but real-world applications need more sophisticated proofs (e.g., proving absence from a location at a specific time) while preserving privacy of other location details. Classical protocols cannot achieve secure position verification.

Method: The authors construct zero-knowledge position verification by combining standard quantum position verification with post-quantum one-way functions. Their key innovation is "position commitments" - a primitive that allows entities to commit to a physical position privately and reveal it later.

Result: They successfully build a zero-knowledge position verification protocol that supports complex temporal location statements and maintains privacy of extraneous location information.

Conclusion: Zero-knowledge position verification is feasible using quantum cryptography and post-quantum primitives, enabling privacy-preserving location proofs for sophisticated statements.

Abstract: Position verification schemes are interactive protocols where entities prove their physical location to others; this enables interactive proofs for statements of the form "I am at a location $L$." Although secure position verification cannot be achieved with classical protocols (even with computational assumptions), they are feasible with quantum protocols.
  In this paper we introduce the notion of zero-knowledge position verification, which generalizes position verification in two ways:
  1. enabling entities to prove more sophisticated statements about their locations at different times (for example, "I was NOT near location $L$ at noon yesterday").
  2. maintaining privacy for any other detail about their true location besides the statement they are proving.
  We construct zero-knowledge position verification from standard position verification and post-quantum one-way functions. The central tool in our construction is a primitive we call position commitments, which allow entities to privately commit to their physical position in a particular moment, which is then revealed at some later time.

Abstract: We evaluate the quantum resource requirements for ATP/metaphosphate hydrolysis, one of the most important reactions in all of biology with implications for metabolism, cellular signaling, and cancer therapeutics. In particular, we consider three algorithms for solving the ground state energy estimation problem: the variational quantum eigensolver, quantum Krylov, and quantum phase estimation. By utilizing exact classical simulation, numerical estimation, and analytical bounds, we provide a current and future outlook for using quantum computers to solve impactful biochemical and biological problems. Our results show that variational methods, while being the most heuristic, still require substantially fewer overall resources on quantum hardware, and could feasibly address such problems on current or near-future devices. We include our complete dataset of biomolecular Hamiltonians and code as benchmarks to improve upon with future techniques.

TL;DR: 提出逆压缩肯尼迪接收机解决S-BPSK信号歧视问题，通过逆压缩算符和光子数分辨探测器实现接近Helstrom界的误码性能，在低光子数域突破相干态极限且具备抗背景噪声鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对二进制相移键控位移压缩真空态(S-BPSK)的信号歧视难题，传统接收机存在性能局限，需设计新型接收架构以充分利用压缩资源并逼近理论最优检测性能

Method: 提出逆压缩肯尼迪(IS-Kennedy)接收机：在常规肯尼迪接收机位移操作后引入逆压缩算符，将S-BPSK信号映射为等效大振幅相干态；采用光子数分辨(PNR)探测器执行最大后验概率(MAP)判决

Result: 理想条件下：误码率在整个能量谱范围内逼近Helstrom界（恒定因子3dB内）；低光子数域(N≈0.6)误码率<1%，突破相干态极限；非理想条件下：PNR检测对背景暗计数具有鲁棒性，并揭示压缩参数失配导致的"奇偶光子数阶梯"饱和效应

Conclusion: 该接收机有效将发射端压缩资源转化为接收位移增益，显著提升S-BPSK检测性能，兼具理论优越性和实际鲁棒性，为量子通信接收机设计提供新方案

Abstract: To address the discrimination problem of binary phase-shift keyed displaced squeezed vacuum states (S-BPSK), this paper proposes an Inverse-squeezing Kennedy (IS-Kennedy) receiver. This architecture incorporates an inverse-squeezing operator following the displacement operation of a conventional Kennedy receiver, mapping the S-BPSK signals onto equivalent large-amplitude coherent states. Furthermore, it employs a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector to perform maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision-making. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under ideal conditions, the IS-Kennedy receiver effectively translates the transmitter's squeezing resources into a displacement gain at the receiver. Consequently, its error probability approaches the Helstrom bound across the entire energy spectrum, remaining within a constant factor of 3 dB. In the low-photon-number regime ($N \approx 0.6$), the proposed scheme surpasses the coherent-state limit, achieving an error rate below 1\%. Furthermore, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of system performance under non-ideal conditions, revealing the robustness of PNR detection against background dark counts and a characteristic ``parity photon-number step'' saturation effect arising from squeezing parameter mismatch.

### [156] [Introduction to Quantum Entanglement Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19111)
*Kazuki Ikeda*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper characterizes quantum entanglement as a global geometric phenomenon using Azumaya algebras and Severi-Brauer schemes, showing that the obstruction to globally defining subsystem decomposition is captured by a Brauer class distinct from traditional topological invariants like Berry or Chern numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While quantum state mathematics is well-studied, entanglement specifically requires deeper analysis. When quantum systems vary over classical parameter spaces, twisted gluing data prevents global identification of Hilbert spaces, making it nontrivial to define entanglement globally and compatibly across the parameter space.

Method: The authors employ Azumaya algebras to describe twisted Hilbert bundles, representing pure-state families as a Severi-Brauer scheme. They characterize global subsystem decomposition conditions by reducing to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety and identify the obstruction as a Brauer class.

Result: Quantum states induce a natural entanglement-based filtration on the Severi-Brauer scheme. For a spin system on a torus, holonomy from gluing produces entangling quantum gates, and the obstruction class is distinct from Berry/Chern numbers, revealing entanglement-geometry connections even in systems without topological band structure.

Conclusion: Entanglement is fundamentally a global geometric property encoded in a Brauer class obstruction. This framework reveals universal geometric quantities in quantum systems that are invisible to traditional topological band theory, providing a new perspective on many-body quantum systems.

Abstract: This article is an expository account aimed at viewing entanglement in finite-dimensional quantum many-body systems as a phenomenon of global geometry. While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme.
  The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme.
  Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers. For instance, even for quantum systems that have traditionally been regarded as having no topological band structure, the entanglement of their eigenstates can be related to global geometric universal quantities, reflecting the background geometry.

Conclusion: QGT的各分量与Berry联络、群速度等物理量直接关联，可作为表征非平衡态动力学的全面探针

Abstract: We investigate the post-quench dynamics of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of 1D periodic systems with a suddenly changed Hamiltonian. The diagonal component with respect to the crystal momentum gives a metric corresponding to the variance of the time-evolved position, and its coefficient of the quadratic term in time is the group-velocity variance, signaling ballistic wavepacket dispersion. The other diagonal QGT component with respect to time reveals the energy variance. The off-diagonal QGT component features a real part as a covariance and an imaginary part representing a quench-induced curvature. Using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as an example, our numerical results of different quenches confirm that the post-quench QGT is governed by physical quantities and local geometric objects from the initial state and post-quench bands, such as the Berry connection, group velocities, and energy variance. Furthermore, the connections between the QGT and physical observables suggest the QGT as a comprehensive probe for nonequilibrium phenomena.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact synthesis offers optimal and canonical circuits but is confined to small problem sizes. The paper aims to make exact synthesis practical for two-qubit Clifford+T circuits, where minimizing T-count is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Method: The framework exhaustively searches a bounded space while using algebraic canonicalization to eliminate redundancy, builds a precomputed lookup table of optimal implementations, and employs meet-in-the-middle algorithms with provable pruning rules and hardware-optimized arithmetic.

Result: The system produces an exact, reusable synthesis engine for two-qubit Clifford+T circuits that achieves exact T-count optimization with significantly better practical performance than prior methods.

Conclusion: By combining theoretical guarantees with algorithmic innovations and hardware-aware design, the work makes exact synthesis feasible for practical two-qubit circuit optimization, providing a valuable compilation tool.

Abstract: Exact synthesis provides unconditional optimality and canonical structure, but is often limited to small, carefully scoped regimes. We present an exact synthesis framework for two-qubit circuits over the Clifford+$T$ gate set that optimizes $T$-count exactly. Our approach exhausts a bounded search space, exploits algebraic canonicalization to avoid redundancy, and constructs a lookup table of optimal implementations that turns synthesis into a query. Algorithmically, we combine meet-in-the-middle ideas with provable pruning rules and problem-specific arithmetic designed for modern hardware. The result is an exact, reusable synthesis engine with substantially improved practical performance.

Abstract: We find a tight characterization of the strong converse exponent for randomness extraction against quantum side information. In contrast to previous tight bounds, we employ a composable error criterion given by the fidelity (or purified distance) to a uniform distribution in product with the marginal state. The characterization is in terms of a club-sandwiched conditional entropy recently introduced by Rubboli, Goodarzi and Tomamichel and used by Li, Li and Yu to establish the strong converse exponent for the case of classical side information. This provides the first precise operational interpretation of this family of conditional entropies in the quantum setting.

Abstract: The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is a fundamental model that describes diverse complex phenomena in nature. However, simulating the NLSE on a quantum computer is inherently challenging due to the presence of the nonlinear term. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework for simulating the NLSE based on the split-step Fourier method. During the linear propagation step, we apply the kinetic evolution operator to generate an intermediate quantum state. Subsequently, the Hadamard test is employed to measure the Fourier components of low-wavenumber modes, enabling the efficient reconstruction of nonlinear potentials. The phase transformation corresponding to the reconstructed potential is then implemented via a quantum circuit using the phase kickback technique. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we numerically simulate the evolution of a Gaussian wave packet, a soliton wave, and the wake flow past a cylinder. The simulation results demonstrate excellent agreement with the corresponding classical solutions. This work provide a concrete basis for analyzing accuracy-cost trade-offs in quantum-classical simulations of nonlinear dispersive wave dynamics.

Conclusion: 为高维量子信息处理提供了可扩展实现方案，并为理解量子-经典边界数学结构提供了新视角。

Abstract: Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) embody the fundamental trade-off between the compressibility of information into limited quantum resources and the accessibility of that information, serving as a cornerstone of quantum communication and computation. In particular, the $(n, n-1)$-QRACs, which encode $n$ bits of classical information into $n-1$ qubits, provides an ideal theoretical model for verifying quantum advantage in high-dimensional spaces; however, the analytical derivation of optimal codes for general $n$ has remained an open problem. In this paper, we establish an analytical construction method for $(n, n-1)$-QRACs by using an explicit operator formalism. We prove that this construction strictly achieves the numerically conjectured upper bound of the average success probability, $\mathcal{P} = 1/2 + \sqrt{(n-1)/n}/2$, for all $n$. Furthermore, we present a systematic algorithm to decompose the derived optimal POVM into standard quantum gates. Since the resulting decoding circuit consists solely of interactions between adjacent qubits, it can be implemented with a circuit depth of $O(n)$ even under linear connectivity constraints. Additionally, we analyze the high-dimensional limit and demonstrate that while the non-commutativity of measurements is suppressed, an information-theoretic gap of $O(\log n)$ from the Holevo bound inevitably arises for symmetric encoding. This study not only provides a scalable implementation method for high-dimensional quantum information processing but also offers new insights into the mathematical structure at the quantum-classical boundary.

Abstract: Operating superconducting qubits at dynamical sweet spots (DSSs) suppresses decoherence from low-frequency flux noise. A key open question is how long coherence can be extended under this strategy and what fundamental limits constrain it. Here we introduce a fully parameterized, multi-objective periodic-flux modulation framework that simultaneously optimizes energy relaxation $T_1$ and pure dephasing $T_φ$, thereby quantifying the tradeoff between them. For fluxonium qubits with realistic noise spectra, our method enhances $T_φ$ by a factor of 3-5 compared with existing DSS strategies while maintaining $T_1$ in the hundred-microsecond range. We further prove that, although DSSs eliminate first-order sensitivity to low-frequency noise, relaxation rate cannot be reduced arbitrarily close to zero, establishing an upper bound on achievable $T_1$. At the optimized working points, we identify double-DSS regions that are insensitive to both DC and AC flux, providing robust operating bands for experiments. As applications, we design single- and two-qubit control protocols at these operating points and numerically demonstrate high-fidelity gate operations. These results establish a general and useful framework for Pareto-front engineering of DSSs that substantially improves coherence and gate performance in superconducting qubits.

Motivation: Surface codes have limitations in quantum error correction, while advanced QEC architectures require more complex decoding methods that traditional approaches cannot efficiently handle, especially under real-world noise and code degeneracy constraints.

Method: The study employs reinforcement learning (including hybrid and multi-agent RL) to decode advanced QEC codes by training agents on noisy syndrome measurements, adapting RL to exploit structural properties of QEC models and combining algorithms to address decoding complexity.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning offers a promising path toward practical quantum computation by enabling efficient, adaptive decoding of next-generation quantum error correction codes, overcoming key limitations of conventional methods.

Abstract: The advent of promising quantum error correction (QEC) codes with efficient resource utilization and high-performance fault-tolerant quantum memories signifies a critical step towards realizing practical quantum computation. While surface codes have been a dominant approach, their limitations have spurred the development of more advanced QEC architectures. These advanced codes often present increased complexity, demanding innovative decoding methodologies. This work investigates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, including hybrid and multi-agent approaches, to enhance the decoding of various advanced QEC architectures. By leveraging the ability of RL to learn optimal strategies from noisy syndrome measurements, we explore the potential for achieving improved logical error rates and scalability compared to traditional decoding methods. Our approach examines the adaptation of reinforcement learning to exploit the structural properties of these modern QEC models. We also explore the benefits of combining different RL algorithms to address the multifaceted nature of the decoding problem, considering factors such as code degeneracy and real-world noise characteristics. With our proposed method, we are able to demonstrate that an autonomously trained agent can derive decoding schemes for the complex decoding requirement of advanced QEC architectures.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum device based on the graphene Josephson junctions, where the vibrational degrees of freedom of a graphene membrane couple to the superconducting circuits. The flexural mode-controlled tunneling of the Cooper pairs introduces a strong and tunable coupling even at the zero-point fluctuations level. By employing this interaction, we show that a parametric process can be efficiently implemented. We then investigate foundational and technological applications of our hybrid device empowered by nonlinear interactions, with fast generation of non-classical mechanical states, and critically enhanced quantum sensing under suitable quantum control.

*Georg Engelhardt,Dahai He,JunYan Luo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Chemical reaction dynamics fundamentally limit precision in molecular concentration measurements via spectrophotometry, with sensitivity regimes and turnover effects revealed by Photon-resolved Floquet theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional precision limits in optical spectrophotometry ignore how chemical reactions alter molecular electronic/optical properties, creating a gap in understanding ultimate measurement accuracy under realistic chemical processes.

Method: Applied Photon-resolved Floquet theory (extending Maxwell-Bloch for higher-order statistics) to a molecular model undergoing chemical reactions, analyzing sensitivity bounds in spectroscopic concentration measurements.

Result: (i) Phase measurements surpass intensity measurements in sensitivity; (ii) Sensitivity exhibits three distinct regimes: photon-shot-noise limited, chemically limited, and intermediate; (iii) Sensitivity shows a turnover versus reaction rate due to coherent-incoherent dynamics interplay.

Conclusion: Chemical properties must be integrated into precision limit estimations for optical spectrophotometry, as reaction kinetics fundamentally constrain measurement sensitivity beyond conventional photon-noise considerations.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate precision limitations in spectrophotometry (i.e., spectroscopic concentration measurements) imposed by chemical processes of molecules. Using the recently developed Photon-resolved Floquet theory, which generalizes Maxwell-Bloch theory for higher-order measurement statistics, we analyze a molecular model system subject to chemical reactions whose electronic and optical properties depend on the chemical state. Analysis of sensitivity bounds reveals: (i) Phase measurements are more sensitive than intensity measurements; (ii) Sensitivity exhibits three regimes: photon-shot-noise limited, chemically limited, and intermediate; (iii) Sensitivity shows a turnover as a function of reaction rate due to the interplay between coherent electronic dynamics and incoherent chemical dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that chemical properties must be considered to estimate ultimate precision limits in optical spectrophotometry.

Conclusion: 该分析框架为改进双模CV-QKD系统的实际实现、性能优化和参数设计提供了理论指导，推动了高鲁棒性CV-QKD技术的实用化进程。

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enables information-theoretically secure key generation between legitimate parties. To further enhance system performance, an improved two-way CV-QKD protocol has been proposed, which is accessible in practice and exhibits increased robustness against excess noise. However, in practical implementations, device nonidealities inevitably drive the optical field from the single-mode regime into the continuous-mode regime. In this work, we introduce temporal modes to characterize the evolution of optical fields in the improved two-way protocol and establish a security analysis framework for the continuous-mode scenario based on adaptive normalization with calibrated shot-noise unit. In addition, finite-size effects are taken into account in the analysis. Our results demonstrate that the improved two-way protocol retains a performance advantage over one-way counterpart. The analysis provides useful guidance for the practical implementation and performance optimization of improved two-way CV-QKD systems.

Abstract: Accurate frequency estimation of oscillating signals over a broad bandwidth is a central task in quantum sensing, yet it is often compromised by spurious responses to higher-order harmonics in realistic multi-frequency environments. Here we experimentally demonstrate a high-accuracy and broadband quantum frequency sensing protocol based on geodesic control, implemented using the electron spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. By engineering an intrinsically single-frequency response, geodesic control enables bias-free frequency estimation with strong suppression of harmonic-induced systematic errors across a wide spectral range spanning from the megahertz to the gigahertz regime. Furthermore, by incorporating synchronized readout, we achieve millihertz-level frequency resolution under noisy signal conditions. Our results provide systematic experimental benchmarking of geodesic control for quantum frequency sensing and establish it as a practical approach for high-accuracy metrology in realistic environments.

Abstract: Generating long-distance quantum entanglement is crucial for advancing quantum information processing. In this work, we propose a protocol for generating remote magnon-phonon entanglement in a hybrid waveguide-magnomechanical system, where multiple spatially separated magnon modes couple to a common waveguide while interacting with their respective phonon modes. By applying tailored pulsed drives and engineering the magnon-phonon interactions, our scheme enables the creation of diverse long-distance and dynamically stable entanglement. Beyond basic magnon-phonon two-mode entanglement, it supports genuine multimode entanglement between a single phonon and multiple magnons, bipartite entanglement between a single magnon and multiple phonons, as well as genuine four-mode entanglement involving two magnons and two phonons. Moreover, we show that dissipative magnon-magnon interactions mediated by traveling photons can generate substantially stronger long-distance entanglement than coherent couplings. Our work provides an experimentally feasible scheme for the remote generation of magnon-phonon entanglement.

Abstract: The sensitivity of a mechanical transducer is ultimately limited by its inherent quantum fluctuations.

Abstract: On a quantum particle in the unit interval $[0,1]$, perform a position measurement with inaccuracy $1/n$ and then a quantum measurement of the projection $|φ\rangle\langleφ|$ with some arbitrary but fixed normalized $φ$. Call the outcomes $X \in[0,1]$ and $Y \in\{0,1\}$. We show that in the limit $n\to\infty$ corresponding to perfect precision for $X$, the probability of $Y=1$ tends to 0 for every $φ$. Since there is no density matrix, pure or mixed, which upon measurement of any $|φ\rangle\langleφ|$ yields outcome 1 with probability 0, our result suggests that a novel type of quantum state beyond Hilbert space is necessary to describe a quantum particle after a perfect position measurement.

Conclusion: 建立了4Hb-TaS₂集成到相干量子电路的可行路线，提供了研究vdW超导体边界和子带隙自由度的基准平台，未来需通过边缘敏感设计增强耦合以探测材料特异性子带隙模式

Abstract: Incorporating van der Waals (vdW) superconductors into Josephson elements extends circuit-QED beyond conventional Al/AlO$_x$/Al tunnel junctions and enables microwave probes of unconventional condensates and subgap excitations. In this work, we realize a flux-tunable transmon whose nonlinear inductive element is an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction. The tunnel barrier is formed by sequential deposition and full in-situ oxidation of ultrathin Al layers on an exfoliated 4Hb-TaS$_2$ flake, followed by deposition of a top Al electrode, yielding a robust, repeatable hybrid junction process compatible with standard transmon fabrication. Embedding the device in a three-dimensional copper cavity, we observe a SQUID-like flux-dependent spectrum that is quantitatively reproduced by a standard dressed transmon--cavity Hamiltonian, from which we extract parameters in the transmon regime. Across measured devices we obtain sub-microsecond energy relaxation ($T_1$ from $0.08$ to $0.69~μ$s), while Ramsey measurements indicate dephasing faster than our $16$ ns time resolution. We also find a pronounced discrepancy between the Josephson energy inferred from spectroscopy and that expected from the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation using room-temperature junction resistances, pointing to nontrivial junction physics in the hybrid Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ system. Although we do not resolve material-specific subgap modes in the present geometry, this work establishes a practical route to integrating 4Hb-TaS$_2$ into coherent quantum circuits and provides a baseline for future edge-sensitive designs aimed at enhancing coupling to boundary and subgap degrees of freedom in vdW superconductors.

Abstract: Linear oscillators contribute to most branches of contemporary quantum science. They have already successfully served as quantum sensors and memories, found applications in quantum communication, and hold promise for cluster-state-based quantum computing. To master universal quantum processing with linear oscillators, an unconditional nonlinear operation is required. We propose such an operation using light-mediated interaction with another system that possesses a nonlinearity equivalent to more than a quadratic potential. Such a potential grants access to a nonlinear operation that can be broadcast to the target linear system. The nonlinear character of the operation can be verified by observing adequate negative values of the target system's Wigner function and the squeezing of the variance of a certain nonlinear combination of the quadratures below the thresholds attainable by Gaussian states. We explicitly evaluate an optically levitated mechanical oscillator as a flexible source of nonlinearity for a proof-of-principle demonstration of the nonlinearity broadcasting to linear systems, for example, mechanical oscillators or macroscopic atomic spin ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子云平台目前缺乏虚拟化能力，每个用户程序独占整个量子处理器，导致资源无法共享、经济扩展性差、服务质量难以区分。现有量子虚拟机(QVM)设计采用空间多路复用，但对硬件异构性、校准漂移和瞬时缺陷非常脆弱，无法适应真实量子设备的噪声环境。

Method: DynQ采用质量加权社区检测方法，将量子处理器建模为基于实时校准数据的加权图，自动发现能够最大化内部门质量同时最小化区域间耦合的执行区域。这种方法在量子计算环境中实现了经典虚拟化的高内聚低耦合原则，生成连接高效、噪声感知且抗串扰和缺陷的执行区域。

Result: 在五个IBM量子后端上的评估显示，在具有明显空间质量变化的硬件上，DynQ相比最先进的QVM和标准编译基线，保真度最高提升19.1%，输出误差降低45.1%。当瞬时硬件缺陷导致基线执行完全失败时，DynQ能动态适应并实现超过86%的保真度。

Conclusion: DynQ通过将校准设备图转换为自适应虚拟硬件抽象，成功解耦了量子程序与脆弱物理布局的依赖关系，为可靠、高利用率的量子云服务提供了基础架构支持，是量子计算虚拟化领域的重要突破。

Abstract: Quantum cloud platforms remain fundamentally non-virtualised: despite rapid hardware scaling, each user program still monopolises an entire quantum processor, preventing resource sharing, economic scalability, and quality-of-service differentiation. Existing Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) designs attempt spatial multiplexing through topology-specific or template-based partitioning, but these approaches are brittle under hardware heterogeneity, calibration drift, and transient defects, which dominate real quantum devices. We present DynQ, the first dynamic, topology-agnostic Quantum Virtual Machine that virtualises quantum hardware using quality-weighted community detection. Instead of imposing fixed geometric regions, DynQ models a quantum processor as a weighted graph derived from live calibration data and automatically discovers execution regions that maximise internal gate quality while minimising inter-region coupling. This operationalises the classical virtualisation principle of high cohesion and low coupling in a quantum-native setting, producing execution regions that are connectivity-efficient, noise-aware, and resilient to crosstalk and defects. We evaluate DynQ across five IBM Quantum backends using calibration-derived noise simulation and on two production devices, comparing against state-of-the-art QVM and standard compilation baselines. On hardware with pronounced spatial quality variation, DynQ achieves up to 19.1 percent higher fidelity and 45.1 percent lower output error. When transient hardware defects cause baseline executions to fail completely, DynQ adapts dynamically and achieves over 86 percent fidelity. By transforming calibrated device graphs into adaptive virtual hardware abstractions, DynQ decouples quantum programs from fragile physical layouts and enables reliable, high-utilisation quantum cloud services.

Conclusion: 建立了AME态与量子码的深刻对应关系，证明了4-qutrit案例的唯一性，阐明了对称群的内在联系，为量子纠错研究提供了新的数学工具。

Abstract: We provide a proof that there exists a bijection between local unitary (LU) orbits of absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states in $(\mathbb{C}^D)^{\otimes n}$ where $n$ is even, also known as perfect tensors, and LU orbits of $((n-1,D,n/2))_D$ quantum error correcting codes. Thus, by a result of Rather et al. (2023), the AME state of 4 qutrits and the pure $((3,3,2))_3$ qutrit code $\mathcal{C}$ are both unique up to the action of the LU group. We further explore the connection between the 4-qutrit AME state and the code $\mathcal{C}$ by showing that the group of transversal gates of $\mathcal{C}$ and the group of local symmetries of the AME state are closely related. Taking advantage of results from Vinberg's theory of graded Lie algebras, we find generators of both of these groups.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a theoretical framework for fast, robust topological quantum state transfer in 1D systems with long-range couplings (e.g., Rydberg atom chains), showing significantly improved transfer efficiency and disorder robustness compared to nearest-neighbor models by leveraging enhanced energy gaps from extended interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable quantum state transfer in platforms with natural long-range interactions (like dipole-dipole coupled Rydberg atom chains), overcoming limitations of nearest-neighbor models by exploiting topological protection.

Method: Theoretical analysis of extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models with long-range couplings; evaluation of time-independent (coherent edge state dynamics) and time-dependent (adiabatic parameter modulation) transfer protocols.

Result: Long-range couplings enhance energy gaps, enabling high-fidelity edge-to-edge excitation transfer with substantial efficiency gains over nearest-neighbor systems; transfer remains robust against positional disorder due to topological protection.

Conclusion: Long-range interacting platforms are highly promising for practical, fault-tolerant quantum state transfer, leveraging topological principles to achieve speed, robustness, and high fidelity unattainable in short-range systems.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for fast, robust and high-fidelity topological quantum state transfer in one-dimensional systems with long-range couplings, motivated by chains of Rydberg atoms with dipole-dipole interactions. Such long-range interactions naturally give rise to extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models supporting topologically protected edge states. We show that these edge states enable high-fidelity edge-to-edge excitation transfer using both time-independent protocols, based on coherent edge state dynamics, and time-dependent protocols, based on adiabatic modulation of system parameters. Long-range couplings play a central role by enhancing the relevant energy gaps, leading to a substantial improvement in transfer efficiency compared to nearest neighbour models. The resulting transfer is robust against positional disorder, reflecting its topological origin and highlighting the potential of long-range interacting platforms for reliable quantum state transfer.

Motivation: 传统 dressed-qubit 方案因控制协议产生 undesired counter-rotating term (CRT)，迫使系统运行在需依赖旋转波近似 (RWA) 的 regime，严重限制了单/双量子比特门速度、保真度、光谱范围等关键性能指标

Method: 在实验室坐标系中仅使用单一耦合轴，设计优化控制协议以完全消除 CRT，无需依赖 RWA；提供通用参数化方法及基于 Floquet 理论的相干时间表达式

Result: 实现多维度性能突破：单量子比特门速度提升、双量子比特门保真度提高、光谱范围扩展、时钟稳定性增强、相干性保持能力优化；理论模型阐明工作机制并降低应用门槛

Conclusion: 该方案成为 dressed-qubit 控制领域的最新标准策略，为基于 dressed-qubit 架构的量子技术实现开辟更广阔的应用前景

Abstract: The applicability and performance of qubits dressed by classical fields are limited because their control protocols give rise to an undesired counter-rotating term (CRT). This in turn forces operation in a regime where a (dressed) rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is valid, thereby restricting key aspects of their operation. Here, using only a single coupling axis in the laboratory frame, we introduce a dressed-qubit control protocol that optimally removes the CRT, eliminating the need for the RWA and delivering substantial improvements in multiple performance metrics, including single-qubit gate speed, two-qubit gate fidelity, spectroscopic range, clock stability, and coherence preservation. In addition, we provide a general parameterization together with a Floquet-based coherence-time expression, which elucidates the protocol's working principles and lowers the barrier to adoption. Collectively, these advances position our scheme as the state-of-the-art strategy for qubit control, paving the way for a wider class of quantum technologies to be realized using dressed-qubit architectures.

Abstract: We develop and analyze a two-oscillator model for black hole evaporation in which an effective geometric degree of freedom and a representative Hawking radiation mode are described by coupled harmonic oscillators with opposite signs in their free Hamiltonians. The normal-mode structure is obtained analytically and the corresponding modal amplitudes determine the pattern of energy exchange between the two sectors. To bridge the discrete and semiclassical pictures, we introduce smooth envelope functions that provide a continuous effective description along the geometric variable. Numerical simulations in a truncated Fock space show that the two oscillators exchange quanta in an approximately out-of-phase manner, consistent with an effective conservation of $\langle n_x\rangle - \langle n_y\rangle$. The reduced entropy $S_x(t)$ exhibits periodic growth, indicating entanglement generation. These results demonstrate that even a minimal two-mode framework can capture key qualitative features of energy transfer and information flow during evaporation.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Q-PreSyn, a reinforcement learning-based strategy, reduces T-count in quantum circuits by up to 20% for circuits up to 25 qubits by finding optimal circuit representations before synthesis, without adding approximation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compiling quantum circuits into Clifford+T gates is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing, where expensive T gates dominate implementation costs. Local synthesis methods used for large circuits produce suboptimal results and their performance heavily depends on circuit representation.

Method: Proposes Q-PreSyn, a reinforcement learning agent that identifies effective sequences of local edits preserving circuit equivalence to transform circuit representations, thereby reducing T-count when subsequent synthesis algorithms are applied.

Result: Experimental results show up to 20% T-count reduction on circuits with up to 25 qubits, without introducing any additional approximation error prior to synthesis.

Conclusion: The RL-based approach successfully addresses suboptimal compilation challenges by optimizing circuit representation, achieving significant T-count improvements over well-known synthesis algorithms while maintaining circuit fidelity.

Abstract: Compiling quantum circuits into Clifford+$T$ gates is a central task for fault-tolerant quantum computing using stabilizer codes. In the near term, $T$ gates will dominate the cost of fault tolerant implementations, and any reduction in the number of such expensive gates could mean the difference between being able to run a circuit or not. While exact synthesis is exponentially hard in the number of qubits, local synthesis approaches are commonly used to compile large circuits by decomposing them into substructures. However, composing local methods leads to suboptimal compilations in key metrics such as $T$-count or circuit depth, and their performance strongly depends on circuit representation. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing \textsc{Q-PreSyn}, a strategy that, given a set of local edits preserving circuit equivalence, uses a RL agent to identify effective sequences of such actions and thereby obtain circuit representations that yield a reduced $T$-count upon synthesis. Experimental results of our proposed strategy, applied on top of well-known synthesis algorithms, show up to a $20\%$ reduction in $T$-count on circuits with up to 25 qubits, without introducing any additional approximation error prior to synthesis.

Abstract: We treat inter-branch message transfer in a Wigner's-friend circuit as a practical benchmark for near-term superconducting quantum processors. Implementing Violaris' unitary message-transfer primitive, we compare performance across IBM Eagle, Nighthawk, and Heron (r2/r3) processors for message sizes up to $n=32$, without error mitigation. We study three message families -- sparse (one-hot), half-weight, and dense -- and measure conditional string success $p_{\mathrm{all}}=\Pr(P=μ\mid R=0)$, memory erasure after uncomputation, and correlation diagnostics (branch contrast and bitwise mutual information). The sparse family compiles to essentially constant two-qubit depth, yielding a depth-controlled probe of device noise: at $n=32$ we observe $p_{\mathrm{all}}$ spanning $\approx0.07$ to $\approx0.68$ across backends. In contrast, half and dense messages incur rapidly growing routing overhead, and transpiler-seed variability becomes a practical limitation near the coherence frontier. We further report an amplitude sweep (no-amplification test) and a divergence ``cousins'' sweep that quantifies degradation with branch-conditioned complexity. All data and figure-generation scripts are released.

### [181] [Spectral Codes: A Geometric Formalism for Quantum Error Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19765)
*Satoshi Kanno,Yoshi-aki Shimada*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A geometric approach using spectral triples from noncommutative geometry unifies quantum error correcting codes by reformulating them as low-energy spectral projections of Dirac operators, relating code performance directly to spectral properties and offering mechanisms to enhance error correction thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified geometric framework that can encompass diverse quantum error correcting codes (classical linear, stabilizer, GKP, topological) and provide new insights into code performance, locality, and optimization beyond conventional algebraic approaches.

Method: Reformulating quantum error correcting codes as low-energy spectral projections of Dirac-type operators within noncommutative geometry, using spectral triples to interpret code properties through the induced metric and spectrum of the Dirac operator.

Result: Unified recovery of all major code families from a single construction; leakage from code space controlled by spectral gap; geometric mechanism to increase error correction thresholds via code-preserving perturbations; interpretation of Berezin-Toeplitz quantization as a mixed spectral code.

Conclusion: Quantum error correction is a universal low-energy phenomenon governed by spectral geometry, providing a powerful new perspective that connects code performance directly to geometric and spectral properties of Dirac operators.

Abstract: We present a new geometric perspective on quantum error correction based on spectral triples in noncommutative geometry. In this approach, quantum error correcting codes are reformulated as low energy spectral projections of Dirac type operators that separate global logical degrees of freedom from local, correctable errors. Locality, code distance, and the Knill Laflamme condition acquire a unified spectral and geometric interpretation in terms of the induced metric and spectrum of the Dirac operator. Within this framework, a wide range of known error correcting codes including classical linear codes, stabilizer codes, GKP type codes, and topological codes are recovered from a single construction. This demonstrates that classical and quantum codes can be organized within a common geometric language. A central advantage of the spectral triple perspective is that the performance of error correction can be directly related to spectral properties. We show that leakage out of the code space is controlled by the spectral gap of the Dirac operator, and that code preserving internal perturbations can systematically increase this gap without altering the encoded logical subspace. This yields a geometric mechanism for enhancing error correction thresholds, which we illustrate explicitly for a stabilizer code. We further interpret Berezin Toeplitz quantization as a mixed spectral code and briefly discuss implications for holographic quantum error correction. Overall, our results suggest that quantum error correction can be viewed as a universal low energy phenomenon governed by spectral geometry.

### [182] [Resolving Gauge Ambiguities of the Berry Connection in Non-Hermitian Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19777)
*Ievgen I. Arkhipov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper resolves gauge ambiguities in non-Hermitian Berry phases by constructing a covariant derivative formalism using the Hilbert space metric tensor, yielding a unique real-valued Berry connection that reduces to the standard Hermitian case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique topological phenomena, but their geometric characterization is hindered by GL(N,C) gauge freedom arising from non-conjugate left and right eigenvectors, resulting in four inequivalent Berry connection definitions and ambiguous complex-valued holonomies.

Method: Introduced a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to establish a gauge-consistent geometric framework.

Result: Derived a unique Berry connection that remains real-valued under arbitrary GL(N,C) frame changes, transforms as an affine gauge potential, and reduces to the conventional Berry/Wilczek-Zee connection in the Hermitian limit.

Conclusion: Established an unambiguous geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in non-Hermitian quantum systems, fully resolving previous ambiguities and complex phase issues.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting unique Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

### [184] [Enhanced quantum state discrimination under general measurements with entanglement and nonorthogonality restrictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19820)
*Swati Choudhary,Aparajita Bhattacharyya,Ujjwal Sen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that quantum state discrimination can achieve error probabilities below the Helstrom bound using non-positive operator-valued measurements (non-POVMs), even without initial entanglement between the system and auxiliary. Initial product states suffice to enable sub-Helstrom discrimination via effective non-positive measurements on subsystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Helstrom limit defines the minimum error probability for distinguishing two quantum states under standard positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs). Existing literature often incorrectly assumes that surpassing this bound requires initial entanglement between the system and an auxiliary. This paper challenges that assumption by exploring resource-constrained scenarios where non-POVM measurements enable sub-Helstrom discrimination.

Method: The authors analyze quantum state discrimination under constrained resource access, examining measurement operations beyond standard POVMs (termed non-POVMs). They specifically investigate whether initial entanglement between the system and auxiliary is necessary for achieving sub-Helstrom error probabilities, contrasting with prior approaches that rely on joint projective measurements and discarding the auxiliary.

Result: The study proves that initial entanglement is not required for sub-Helstrom discrimination. Effective non-positive measurements on the subsystem can arise even with initial product states (no entanglement), enabling error probabilities below the Helstrom bound. This demonstrates a broader class of non-POVM measurements that violate the conventional Helstrom limit assumption.

Conclusion: Non-positive operator-valued measurements can achieve sub-Helstrom discrimination without initial entanglement between the system and auxiliary. Product states alone suffice to generate effective non-positive measurements on subsystems, fundamentally expanding the understanding of quantum measurement strategies beyond standard POVM frameworks and challenging established resource requirements for quantum state discrimination.

Abstract: The minimum error probability for distinguishing between two quantum states is bounded by the Helstrom limit, derived under the assumption that measurement strategies are restricted to positive operator-valued measurements. We explore scenarios in which the error probability for discriminating two quantum states can be reduced below the Helstrom bound under some constrained access of resources, indicating the use of measurement operations that go beyond the standard positive operator-valued measurements framework. We refer to such measurements as non-positive operator-valued measurements. While existing literature often associates these measurements with initial entanglement between the system and an auxiliary, followed by joint projective measurement and discarding the auxiliary, we demonstrate that initial entanglement between system and auxiliary is not necessary for the emergence of such measurements in the context of state discrimination. Interestingly, even initial product states can give rise to effective non-positive measurements on the subsystem, and achieve sub-Helstrom discrimination error when discriminating quantum states of the subsystem.

Abstract: Qubit shuttling has become an indispensable ingredient for scaling leading quantum computing platforms, including semiconductor spin, neutral-atom, and trapped-ion qubits, enabling both crosstalk reduction and tighter integration of control hardware. Cai et al. (2023) proposed a scalable architecture that employs short-range shuttling to realize effective three-dimensional connectivity on a strictly two-dimensional device. Building on recent advances in quantum error correction, we show that this architecture enables the native implementation of folded surface codes on 2D hardware, reducing the runtime of all single-qubit logical Clifford gates and logical CNOTs within subsets of qubits from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ in conventional surface code lattice surgery to constant time. We present explicit protocols for these operations and demonstrate that access to a transversal $S$ gate reduces the spacetime volume of 8T-to-CCZ magic-state distillation by more than an order of magnitude compared with standard 2D lattice surgery approaches. Finally, we introduce a new "virtual-stack" layout that more efficiently exploits the quasi-three-dimensional structure of the architecture, enabling efficient multilayer routing on these two-dimensional devices.

Abstract: Low check weight is practically crucial code property for fault-tolerant quantum computing, which underlies the strong interest in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. Here, we explore the theory of weight-constrained stabilizer codes from various foundational perspectives including the complexity of computing code weight and the explicit boundary of feasible low-weight codes in both theoretical and practical settings. We first prove that calculating the optimal code weight is an $\mathsf{NP}$-hard problem, demonstrating the necessity of establishing bounds for weight that are analytical or efficiently computable. Then we systematically investigate the feasible code parameters with weight constraints. We provide various explicit analytical lower bounds and in particular completely characterize stabilizer codes with weight at most 3, showing that they have distance 2 and code rate at most 1/4. We also develop a powerful linear programming (LP) scheme for setting code parameter bounds with weight constraints, which yields exact optimal weight values for all code parameters with $n\leq 9$. We further refined this constraint from multiple perspectives by considering the generator weight distribution and overlap. In particular, we consider practical architectures and demonstrate how to apply our methods to e.g.~the IBM 127-qubit chip. Our study brings the weight as a crucial parameter into coding theory and provide guidance for code design and utility in practical scenarios.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper establishes a precise link between graph topology and quantum exchange symmetry, proving that complete graphs generate fully symmetric states while appropriately oriented complete directed graphs produce fully antisymmetric states, thereby unifying bosonic and fermionic exchange symmetry descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a precise correspondence between graph topology and exchange symmetry properties in multipartite quantum states, and to generalize the standard graph state construction beyond symmetric cases to capture both bosonic and fermionic statistics.

Method: The authors prove a theorem connecting graph completeness to permutation symmetry, then introduce a generalized graph construction using a non-commutative two-qudit gate (GR) that requires directed edges and explicit vertex ordering.

Result: 1) Graph states are fully symmetric under particle permutations if and only if the underlying graph is complete. 2) Complete directed graphs with appropriate orientations for odd numbers of qudits generate fully antisymmetric multipartite states. 3) These results provide a unified graph-theoretic description of bosonic and fermionic exchange symmetry.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that graph completeness determines symmetric exchange properties while edge orientation determines antisymmetric exchange properties, offering a unified graph-theoretic framework for describing both bosonic and fermionic multipartite states.

Abstract: Graph states provide a powerful framework for describing multipartite entanglement in quantum information science. In their standard formulation, graph states are generated by controlled-$Z$ interactions and naturally encode symmetric exchange properties. Here we establish a precise correspondence between graph topology and exchange symmetry by proving that a graph state is fully symmetric under particle permutations if and only if the underlying graph is complete. We then introduce a generalized graph-based construction using a non-commutative two-qudit gate, denoted $GR$, which requires directed edges and an explicit vertex ordering. We show that complete directed graphs endowed with appropriate orientations, for an odd number of qudits generate fully antisymmetric multipartite states. Together, these results provide a unified graph-theoretic description of bosonic and fermionic exchange symmetry based on graph completeness and edge orientation.

### [188] [Distinguishing synthetic unravelings on quantum computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19889)
*Eloy Piñol,Piotr Sierant,Dustin Keys,Romain Veyron,Miguel Angel García-March,Tanner Reese,Morgan W. Mitchell,Jan Wehr,Maciej Lewenstein*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that different quantum measurement schemes (unravelings) produce distinct trajectory statistics despite identical ensemble-averaged dynamics. Using IBM quantum computers, they implemented two synthetic unravelings and showed that nonlinear metrics like variance and von Neumann entropy can distinguish them, revealing hidden information about measurement backaction in quantum trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an accessible demonstration that quantum trajectories encode information about measurement backaction beyond what is captured by unconditional dynamics, overcoming the experimental challenges of previous optical implementations.

Method: Designed two synthetic unravelings (projective measurement and random-unitary "kick") as quantum circuits that share the same ensemble-averaged evolution, then implemented them on IBM Quantum superconducting qubits to compare trajectory-level statistics including variance and von Neumann entropy.

Result: Both theory and experiment confirmed that variance across trajectories and ensemble-averaged von Neumann entropy successfully distinguish the unravelings, while linear expectation values and unconditional states remain identical as predicted.

Conclusion: Quantum trajectories contain information about measurement backaction that is not fixed by the unconditional dynamics, and this effect can be demonstrated through accessible digital quantum simulation on current hardware.

Abstract: Distinct monitoring or intervention schemes can produce different conditioned stochastic quantum trajectories while sharing the same unconditional (ensemble-averaged) dynamics. This is the essence of unravelings of a given Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation: any trajectory-ensemble average of a function that is linear in the conditional state is completely determined by the unconditional density matrix, whereas applying a nonlinear function before averaging can yield unraveling-dependent results beyond the average evolution. A paradigmatic example is resonance fluorescence, where direct photodetection (jump/Poisson) and homodyne or heterodyne detection (diffusive/Wiener) define inequivalent unravelings of the same GKSL dynamics. In earlier work, we showed that nonlinear trajectory averages can distinguish such unravelings, but observing the effect in that optical setting requires demanding experimental precision. Here we translate the same idea to a digital setting by introducing synthetic unravelings implemented as quantum circuits acting on one and two qubits. We design two unravelings - a projective measurement unraveling and a random-unitary "kick" unraveling - that share the same ensemble-averaged evolution while yielding different nonlinear conditional-state statistics. We implement the protocols on superconducting-qubit hardware provided by IBM Quantum to access trajectory-level information. We show that the variance across trajectories and the ensemble-averaged von Neumann entropy distinguish the unravelings in both theory and experiment, while the unconditional state and the ensemble-averaged expectation values that are linear in the state remain identical. Our results provide an accessible demonstration that quantum trajectories encode information about measurement backaction beyond what is fixed by the unconditional dynamics.
