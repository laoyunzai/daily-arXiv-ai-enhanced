### [1] [Eigenstate condensation in quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18869)
*Christopher David White,Michael Winer,Noam Bernstein*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper studies eigenstate condensation in finite-dimensional quantum systems under energy constraints, revealing three distinct phases (ground-state, high-temperature, anti-ground-state) with exponentially sharp transitions between them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of eigenstate condensation - previously studied in infinite-dimensional systems - to physically relevant finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and characterize how phase transitions behave with system size.

Method: Analyzing random quantum states from the Haar ensemble constrained by energy expectation value E_av in systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, particularly local spin systems.

Result: Three phases emerge: 1) Ground-state phase (E_av < E_c): macroscopic overlap with ground state; 2) High-temperature phase: exponentially small overlap with all eigenstates; 3) Anti-ground-state phase: macroscopic overlap with highest excited state. Transitions show exponential finite-size scaling.

Conclusion: Unlike polynomial scaling in infinite systems, finite-dimensional systems exhibit exponentially sharp crossovers, making the high-temperature phase an extended phase rather than a sharp transition point, fundamentally changing the understanding of eigenstate condensation in realistic quantum systems.

Abstract: Random quantum states drawn from the Haar ensemble with a constraint on the energy expectation value $E_{\mathrm{av}} = \langle ψ| H | ψ\rangle$ display \textit{eigenstate condensation}: for $E_{\mathrm{av}}$ below a critical value $E_c$, they develop macroscopic overlap with the ground state. We study eigenstate condensation in systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. These systems display three phases: a ground-state phase, in which energy-constrained random states have macroscopic overlap with the ground state; a high-temperature phase, in which they have exponentially small overlap with each energy eigenstate; and an anti-ground-state phase, in which they have macroscopic overlap with the most highly excited state. In local spin systems the ground-state and anti-ground-state phases approach the middle of the spectrum as $1/[\text{system size}]$, but -- because the condensation phase transitions have exponential, rather than polynomial, finite-size scaling -- the crossover becomes exponentially sharp in system size and the high-temperature phase is best understood as an extended phase.

### [2] [Interaction-Conditional Semantics and the Dissolution of Quantum Paradoxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18810)
*Jonathon Sendall*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文认为量子力学中的多个经典谜题源于将测量条件结果非法提升为固有属性的语义错误，提出四条构型相对断言原则，在不引入新物理的情况下统一消解这些谜题，并将贝尔定理和科亨-斯佩克特定理重新解释为解释结构约束，最终建立一种关系性客观性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找量子力学多个经典谜题（自旋测量、双缝、纠缠、魏格纳朋友）的共同起源，并给出统一解决方案。

Method: 提出四条仅允许构型相对性断言的原则，将结果锚定在物理测量几何上。

Result: 这些原则在不引入新物理或特设解释的情况下消解了所有谜题；贝尔定理和科亨-斯佩克特定理被揭示为对解释结构的约束。

Conclusion: 建立了一种既非朴素属性实在论也非观察者主观主义的"关系性客观性"。

Abstract: This paper argues that several canonical puzzles in quantum mechanics, including spin measurement, the double slit, entanglement correlations, and Wigner's friend, share a common origin in a semantic error and the illicit promotion of interaction conditional outcomes to intrinsic properties. I introduce four principles that license only configuration relative predication, grounding outcomes in physical measurement geometry while preserving objectivity. Applying these principles uniformly dissolves each puzzle without new physics or ad hoc interpretive machinery. Bell's theorem and the Kochen-Specker theorem are reframed not as dynamical mysteries but as constraints on permissible explanatory structure, evidence that intrinsic-outcome semantics is incompatible with empirical reality. The result is a relational objectivity that avoids both naive property realism and observer subjectivism.

### [3] [Mikado strategy for the detection of atoms in images of microtrap arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19396)
*Marc Cheneau,François Goudail*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种交替估计-检测策略用于微阱阵列原子检测，避免显式后验概率建模，提升光学分辨率不足时的检测精度并增强实验环境鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进先前微阱阵列原子检测方法，解决原子位点光学分辨率不足及真实实验条件噪声干扰的问题。

Method: 采用估计与检测交替进行的迭代策略，省去显式计算后验占据概率模型的步骤。

Result: 相比先前工作，在光学分辨率不足时检测精度提升，并预期对真实实验条件具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该交替策略为微阱阵列原子检测提供了更优解决方案，兼具精度提升和环境适应性。

Abstract: Building on top of our recent work [arXiv:2502.08511], we introduce a new strategy to solve the problem of detecting atoms in high-resolution images of microtrap arrays. By alternating estimation and detection steps, we get rid of the need for an explicit model to compute the posterior occupancy probability of each site given its a priori optimal estimate. As direct benefits, we show an improved detection accuracy compared to our previous work when the sites are not optically well resolved, and we expect a greater robustness against real experimental conditions.

### [4] [A framework to evaluate the performance of Variational Quantum Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18812)
*Ernesto Mamedaliev,Vladyslav Libov,Albert Nieto-Morales,Oskar Słowik,Arit Kumar Bishwas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a standardized evaluation framework for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) on QUBO problems using three metrics (feasibility, quality, reproducibility) and a quality diagram, with reproducibility measured via Shannon entropy, and demonstrates it on 16-qubit problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking VQAs is challenging due to their stochastic nature and lack of standardized performance criteria, making systematic comparison and evaluation difficult.

Method: Introduces a general framework with three complementary metrics (feasibility, quality, reproducibility), a quality diagram for visualizing success probability vs. resource trade-offs, formalizes reproducibility using Shannon entropy, and defines a decision rule for algorithm selection; tested on several VQAs using CVaR cost functions with varying shot counts on a 16-qubit QUBO instance.

Result: The framework enables systematic benchmarking of VQAs and reveals performance trade-offs between success probability and computational resources.

Conclusion: This framework provides a foundation for adaptive algorithm selection in hybrid quantum-classical workflows and establishes standardized evaluation practices for VQAs.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising methods for solving combinatorial optimization problems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, benchmarking VQAs is difficult due to their stochastic behavior and the lack of standardized performance criteria. This work introduces a general framework for evaluating VQAs applied to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. The framework uses three complementary metrics: feasibility, quality, and reproducibility. It also introduces a quality diagram that visualizes trade-offs between success probability and computational resources. Reproducibility is formalized using Shannon entropy, and a decision rule is defined for selecting algorithms under resource constraints. As a demonstration, the framework is applied to several VQAs using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) cost functions and different shot counts on a 16-qubit QUBO instance. The results show how the framework supports systematic benchmarking and provides a foundation for adaptive algorithm selection in hybrid quantum-classical workflows.

### [5] [Lightweight Quantum-Enhanced ResNet for Coronary Angiography Classification: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Feature Enhancement Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18814)
*Jingsong Xia*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical neural network (LQER) combining ResNet18 with a parameterized quantum circuit achieves >90% accuracy in classifying coronary angiography images, outperforming classical baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary angiography interpretation is highly operator-dependent, and conventional deep learning models struggle with complex vascular morphology and fine-grained textures, limiting diagnostic reliability.

Method: Proposed LQER: pretrained ResNet18 extracts classical features, a parameterized quantum circuit (with data re-uploading and entanglement) enhances high-level semantics, followed by residual fusion and end-to-end hybrid optimization using minimal qubits.

Result: LQER achieved >90% test accuracy, surpassing ResNet18 in accuracy, AUC, and F1-score, with particularly improved discrimination of positive lesions under class imbalance.

Conclusion: Validates a practical hybrid quantum-classical learning paradigm for medical imaging, offering a feasible pathway for deploying quantum machine learning in clinical coronary angiography analysis.

Abstract: Background: Coronary angiography (CAG) is the cornerstone imaging modality for evaluating coronary artery stenosis and guiding interventional decision-making. However, interpretation based on single-frame angiographic images remains highly operator-dependent, and conventional deep learning models still face challenges in modeling complex vascular morphology and fine-grained texture patterns.Methods: We propose a Lightweight Quantum-Enhanced ResNet (LQER) for binary classification of coronary angiography images. A pretrained ResNet18 is employed as a classical feature extractor, while a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is introduced at the high-level semantic feature space for quantum feature enhancement. The quantum module utilizes data re-uploading and entanglement structures, followed by residual fusion with classical features, enabling end-to-end hybrid optimization with a strictly controlled number of qubits.Results: On an independent test set, the proposed LQER outperformed the classical ResNet18 baseline in accuracy, AUC, and F1-score, achieving a test accuracy exceeding 90%. The results demonstrate that lightweight quantum feature enhancement improves discrimination of positive lesions, particularly under class-imbalanced conditions.Conclusion: This study validates a practical hybrid quantum--classical learning paradigm for coronary angiography analysis, providing a feasible pathway for deploying quantum machine learning in medical imaging applications.

### [6] [Phase Diagrams of Information Backflow: Unifying Entanglement Revivals and Entropy Overshoots in Minimal Non-Markovian Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18822)
*Koichi Nakagawa*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出信息回流相图框架，统一量子纠缠复苏与经典熵超调对非马尔可夫性的诊断，揭示α≈1/2处普适边界源于记忆核数学结构而非量子特性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非马尔可夫动力学的记忆效应诊断方法（量子关联复苏/经典信息量非单调性）缺乏统一框架比较其"回流相"

Method: 构建通用回流泛函N_I=∫_{İ>0}İ dt：量子侧采用热场动力学嵌入的分数阶两态耗散模型，经典侧采用指数核广义主方程/埃尔朗等待时间半马尔可夫过程

Result: 量子侧得纠缠分量b_qe(t)=¼[E_α(-λ^αt^α)]²sin²(ωt)，经典侧熵超调ΔH；两者在(α,ω/λ)平面均呈现α≈1/2的锐利边界

Conclusion: 提供模型无关的非马尔可夫性分类方案：隐藏自由度存储的记忆以非单调信息流形式返回观测区，相图边界由核函数数学结构决定

Abstract: Memory effects in non-Markovian dynamics are often diagnosed either via quantum-correlation revivals or via non-monotonic classical information measures, yet a unified minimal framework comparing their ``backflow phases'' is still lacking. Here we propose an information-backflow phase-diagram approach that places \emph{quantum entanglement revivals} and \emph{classical entropy overshoots} on the same footing through a common backflow functional $N_I=\int_{\dot I>0}\dot I\,dt$. On the quantum side, we employ a fractional (Caputo) extension of a two-state dissipative model embedded by thermo-field dynamics (TFD), yielding a closed-form intrinsic entanglement component $b^{(α)}_{qe}(t)=\frac14[E_α(-λ^αt^α)]^2\sin^2(ωt)$ and an integrated revival measure $N_{qe}$ that delineates a sharp boundary near $α\simeq 1/2$ in the $(α,ω/λ)$ plane. On the classical side, we consider a three-state model whose Markov generator is promoted either to an exponential-kernel generalized master equation (with exact Markov embedding) or to a semi-Markov process with Erlang-2 waiting times. We quantify non-monotonicity by the entropy overshoot $ΔH$ and KL-based diagnostics on the probability simplex. To strengthen the quantum--classical symmetry, we further introduce a \emph{fractional Mittag--Leffler memory kernel} in the classical dynamics and show that an analogous backflow transition emerges around $α\simeq 1/2$, indicating that the boundary originates from the kernel's mathematical structure rather than from quantumness per se. Overall, our results provide a compact, model-agnostic route to classify non-Markovianity by phase diagrams of information backflow and to interpret them via a shared embedding narrative: memory stored in hidden degrees of freedom returns to the observed sector as non-monotonic information flow.

### [7] [Feshbach-Villars Hamiltonian Approach to the Klein-Gordon Oscillator and Supercritical Step Scattering in Standard and Generalized Doubly Special Relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18836)
*A. Boumali,N. Jafari,Y. Chargui*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper develops a Feshbach-Villars Hamiltonian framework for relativistic quantum mechanics with Planck-scale deformations, showing how such deformations affect particle spectra and scattering, particularly delaying pair-production thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a consistent first-order Hamiltonian formulation for spin-0 relativistic quantum dynamics incorporating Planck-scale kinematic deformations from generalized doubly special relativity, which is crucial for understanding quantum gravity effects on particle physics.

Method: Starting from a generic nonlinear momentum-space map, the authors derive a modified dispersion relation at leading order in Planck length, construct a FV linearization of the deformed Klein-Gordon operator, and ensure the Hamiltonian remains σ₃-pseudo-Hermitian to guarantee charge conservation, then apply this to oscillator and scattering problems.

Result: The framework yields a two-component pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian that conserves FV charge and current, enabling current-based definitions of reflection/transmission. For the oscillator, it shows controlled spectral shifts and level spacing changes. For scattering, it computes reflection/transmission coefficients and quantifies shifts in the supercritical threshold, finding that MS-type deformations delay pair-production.

Conclusion: The FV framework successfully describes Planck-scale deformed relativistic dynamics, with MS-type deformations generally delaying the onset of supercritical regimes and reducing negative transmitted flux within the domain where Planck-length times energy is much less than 1.

Abstract: We develop a first-order Feshbach-Villars (FV) Hamiltonian framework for spin-0 relativistic quantum dynamics in the presence of Planck-scale kinematic deformations described within generalized doubly special relativity (G-DSR). Starting from a generic nonlinear momentum-space map, we derive the corresponding modified dispersion relation (MDR) at leading order in the Planck length \(l_p\) and construct a consistent FV linearization of the deformed Klein-Gordon operator. The resulting two-component Hamiltonian remains \(σ_3\)-pseudo-Hermitian at \(\mathcal{O}(l_p)\), which guarantees conservation of the FV charge and current and provides a current-based definition of reflection and transmission in stationary scattering.
  As applications, we study two benchmark settings in which the FV metric structure is essential: (i) the one-dimensional Klein-Gordon oscillator and (ii) scattering from electrostatic step and barrier potentials. For the oscillator, we obtain controlled \(\mathcal{O}(l_p)\) branch-resolved spectral shifts and show how kinetic versus mass-shell deformations reshape the level spacing and the high-energy spectral compression. For step and barrier scattering, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients directly from the pseudo-Hermitian FV current and quantify the deformation-induced shift of the supercritical (pair-production) threshold. A comparative analysis of the Amelino-Camelia and Magueijo-Smolin realizations indicates that MS-type deformations generally delay the onset of the supercritical regime and reduce the magnitude of the negative transmitted flux within the validity domain \(l_p E \ll 1\).

### [8] [Quantum Simulation of the Polaron-Molecule Transition on a NISQ Device](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18839)
*Hugo Catala,Ezequiel Valero,German Rodrigo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A digital quantum simulation framework using Jordan-Wigner transformation and Trotter-Suzuki decomposition successfully simulates Fermi polaron and BEC-BCS crossover on quantum hardware, showing smooth polaron-to-molecule transitions and noise resilience via a hybrid variational approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strongly correlated fermionic systems pose computational challenges due to exponential Hilbert space growth and the fermionic sign problem. This work addresses these challenges by developing a quantum simulation framework to study the Fermi polaron and the BEC-BCS crossover, bridging pairing superfluidity and impurity physics.

Method: The researchers developed a unified Hamiltonian formalism, mapped the system onto a gate-based quantum processor using Jordan-Wigner transformation, and implemented it via first-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. A Ramsey interferometry protocol was used to extract real-time dynamics and spectral response, with a hybrid variational approach employed to mitigate hardware noise.

Result: The simulation demonstrated a smooth transition from a dressed quasiparticle (polaron) regime to a stable molecular bound state, with linear energy renormalization in the strong-coupling limit. Results were validated against exact classical benchmarks and successfully executed on the Barcelona Supercomputing Center quantum hardware. The hybrid variational approach showed remarkable resilience to noise, accurately capturing the bifurcation of spectral density.

Conclusion: The presented quantum simulation framework effectively addresses the computational challenges of strongly correlated fermionic systems, successfully capturing the BEC-BCS crossover physics and demonstrating that hybrid variational methods can provide accurate results even on noisy current-generation quantum hardware.

Abstract: The simulation of strongly correlated fermionic systems remains one of the most significant challenges in computational physics due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the fermionic sign problem. In this work, we present a digital quantum simulation framework to explore the Fermi polaron and the Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover. We develop a unified Hamiltonian formalism that bridges pairing superfluidity and impurity physics, mapping the system onto a gate-based quantum processor via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Using a first-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, we implement a Ramsey interferometry protocol to extract the real-time dynamics and spectral response of the system.
  Our results demonstrate a smooth transition from a dressed quasiparticle (polaron) regime to a stable molecular bound state, characterized by a linear energy renormalization in the strong-coupling limit. We validate our simulation against exact classical benchmarks and report successful execution on the Barcelona Supercomputing Center quantum hardware. Despite the inherent noise of the quantum hardware, the hybrid variational approach shows remarkable resilience, accurately capturing the bifurcation of the spectral density

### [9] [Operationally induced preferred basis in unitary quantum mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18856)
*Vitaly Pronskikh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper argues that the quantum measurement problem persists due to a fundamental mathematical type mismatch: experimental data uses Boolean event algebra while theory uses noncommutative operator algebra. The measurement basis is induced by the detector and readout, not just the system Hamiltonian, with randomness originating from stochastic transition rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the persistent preferred-basis and definite-outcome problems in quantum measurement theory by clarifying the structural role of measurement apparatus and the mathematical foundations of quantum probabilities.

Method: Conceptual analysis of the algebraic mismatch between theory and experiment; application of Gleason-type uniqueness theorems for probability measures; construction of a concrete qubit-pointer model demonstrating detector-induced basis via POVMs; derivation of a non-composability lemma from nested-observer scenarios.

Result: The 'cut' is identified as a necessary interface between group-based kinematics and set-based counting; the trace rule is proven unique for consistent probability assignment under unitary symmetry; a model shows explicit basis induction by detector resolution; a non-composability lemma obstructs joint outcome assignments without joint instruments.

Conclusion: The measurement problem's core is the mathematical type change from operator algebra to Boolean algebra; measurement basis is induced by the instrument; randomness is fundamentally rooted in the stochasticity of transition rules rather than unitary dynamics alone.

Abstract: The preferred-basis problem and the definite-outcome aspect of the measurement problem persist even if the detector is modeled unitarily, because experimental data are necessarily represented in a Boolean event algebra of mutually exclusive records whereas the theoretical description is naturally formulated in a noncommutative operator algebra with continuous unitary symmetry. This change of mathematical type constitutes the core of the 'cut': a structurally necessary interface from group-based kinematics to set-based counting. In the presented view the basis relevant for recorded outcomes is not determined by the system Hamiltonian alone; it is induced by the measurement mapping, i.e., by the detector channel together with the coarse-grained readout that defines an instrument. The probabilistic mapping is anchored in symmetry and measure theory: by Gleason-type uniqueness (Gleason for projections in $d>2$ and Busch's extension for Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs) including $d=2$), the trace rule is the unique probability measure consistent with additivity over exclusive events and basis-independence of the unitary sector. A compact qubit--pointer model yields an induced unsharp POVM $E_\pm=\tfrac12(\id\pm η\,σ_z)$ with $η$ fixed by pointer resolution, displaying explicitly how the detector induces the relevant basis. Finally, nested-observer paradoxes are tightened into a non-composability lemma: joint assignment of outcome propositions is obstructed unless a joint instrument exists. This relocates the origin of randomness to the stochasticity of the transition rules.

### [10] [Post-selection games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18861)
*Víctor Calleja Rodríguez,Ivan A. Bocanegra-Garay,Mateus Araújo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文引入后选择游戏，这是一种非局部游戏的推广，允许裁判弃用每轮结果。研究者开发了计算其局域性和Tsirelson界的算法，并证明这类游戏在统计能力上对传统非局部游戏具有无界优势，特别适用于低探测效率的贝尔测试分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形式化非定域性的可能性证明（如Hardy悖论），并解决传统非局部游戏在分析低探测效率贝尔测试时统计能力不足的问题。

Method: 开发算法计算后选择游戏的局域性界和Tsirelson界。

Result: 证明后选择游戏在统计能力上对传统非局部游戏具有无界优势。

Conclusion: 后选择游戏是分析低探测效率贝尔测试的理想工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce post-selection games, a generalization of nonlocal games where each round can be not only won or lost by the players, but also discarded by the referee. Such games naturally formalize possibilistic proofs of nonlocality, such as Hardy's paradox. We develop algorithms for computing the local and Tsirelson bounds of post-selection games. Furthermore, we show that they have an unbounded advantage in statistical power over traditional nonlocal games, making them ideally suited for analysing Bell tests with low detection efficiency.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 实验测量了两个强度关联函数，直接验证了光场算符的玻色对易关系，结果与量子理论预测一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正则对易关系是量子理论的基石，支撑海森堡不确定性原理。尽管不确定性关系已被广泛检验，但对对易关系本身的直接验证仍具挑战。

Method: 通过测量两个不同的强度关联函数，提取单光子态和相干态下场算符对易子的期望值。

Result: 单光子态和相干态下的测量值均与理论值1相符。

Conclusion: 实验结果定量验证了量子理论，首次直接证实了玻色对易关系。

Abstract: The canonical commutation relation is a cornerstone of quantum theory and underlies the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Although uncertainty relations have been extensively tested, direct verifications of the underlying commutation relation itself have remained elusive. We report an experimental demonstration of the bosonic commutation relation for optical field operators based on measurements of two distinct intensity correlation functions. From these measurements, we extract the expectation value of the field-operator commutator for both a single-photon state and coherent state. In both cases, the measured values are consistent with unity, in quantitative agreement with quantum theory.

*Ladina Hausmann,Renato Renner*

TL;DR: 量子态的概率表示法面临内在矛盾：为保证操作意义必须具备拓扑鲁棒性，但这种鲁棒性使其无法保留子系统结构等基本物理要素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基于测量概率的量子态表示方法的基本限制，理解其在保持实验可操作意义的同时保留子系统结构等核心物理特征所面临的内在约束。

Method: 理论分析量子概率表示的拓扑性质与结构要求，识别不同性质之间的冲突关系。

Result: 发现拓扑鲁棒性（保持态之间的接近性）与保留子系统结构之间存在不可避免的张力。

Conclusion: 拓扑鲁棒的概率表示无法同时保留子系统结构，这揭示了量子态操作表示的基本限制，对量子理论基础和量子信息处理有重要启示。

Abstract: The state $ρ$ of a quantum system can be represented by a vector $\mathbf{P}_{\mathcal{M}}(ρ)$ of outcome probabilities for a set of measurements $\mathcal{M}$. Such representations appear throughout physics, for example, in quantum field theory via correlation functions and in quantum foundations within generalized probabilistic frameworks. In this work, we identify an unavoidable tension: to enable operationally meaningful statements, the map ${ρ\mapsto \mathbf{P}_{\mathcal{M}}(ρ)}$ must be topologically robust $\unicode{x2013}$ preserving the notion of closeness between states. Yet, a probability representation that is topologically robust cannot simultaneously retain other essential structure, such as the subsystem structure.

Abstract: We introduce multivariate multicycle (MM) codes, a new family of quantum error correcting codes that unifies and generalizes bivariate bicycle codes, multivariate bicycle codes, abelian two-block group algebra codes, generalized bicycle codes, trivariate tricycle codes, and n-dimensional toric codes. MM codes are Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes defined from length-t chain complexes with $t \ge 4$. The chief advantage of these codes is that they possess metachecks and high confinement that permit complete single-shot decoding, while also having additional algebraic structure that might enable logical non-Clifford gates. We offer a framework that facilitates the construction of long-length chain complexes through the use of Koszul complex. In particular, obtaining explicit boundary maps (parity check and metacheck matrices) is particularly straightforward in our approach. This simple but very general parameterization of codes permitted us to efficiently perform a numerical search, where we identify several MM code candidates that demonstrate these capabilities at high rates and high code distances. Examples of new codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ include $[[96, 12, 8]]$, $[[96, 44, 4]]$ $[[144, 40, 4]]$, $[[216, 12, 12]]$, $[[360, 30, 6]]$, $[[384, 80, 4]]$, $[[486, 24, 12]]$, $[[486, 66, 9]]$ and $[[648, 60, 9]]$. Notably, our codes achieve confinement profiles that surpass all known single-shot decodable quantum CSS codes of practical blocksize.

Abstract: Many challenges arising in Quantum Technology can be successfully addressed using a set of machine learning algorithms collectively known as reinforcement learning (RL), based on adaptive decision-making through interaction with the quantum device. After a concise and intuitive introduction to RL aimed at a broad physics readership, we discuss the key ideas and core concepts in reinforcement learning with a particular focus on quantum systems. We then survey recent progress in RL in all relevant areas. We discuss state preparation in few- and many-body quantum systems, the design and optimization of high-fidelity quantum gates, and the automated construction of quantum circuits, including applications to variational quantum eigensolvers and architecture search.

*Xiao-Bo Yan,Liu Yang,Bing He*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 基于三腔耦合系统（一腔含增益，两腔有损耗），通过破坏性干涉实现任意功率下的完全透明传输，且透明窗口可调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电磁感应透明(EIT)在原子介质中实现近100%透射需要苛刻的实验条件，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 设计三个线性耦合光学谐振腔：一个主动腔（可带任意光增益）和两个被动腔（仅有损耗），利用破坏性干涉消除输入腔的腔内场。

Result: 只需调节两个被动腔之间的耦合强度，即可在任意透射场功率和所有可行耦合参数下实现完全透明，并能自由调控透明窗口尺寸和输出光强。

Conclusion: 该结构实现了类似EIT的完全透明效应，突破了传统介质的限制，具有更高的实用性和灵活性。

Abstract: The phenomena of induced transparency, with the typical examples of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic media and coupled optical resonators, have attracted tremendous interest since their discoveries. Due to the limitations of the involved elements, however, near-100\% transmissions were reported under highly demanding experimental conditions for atomic and other media. Based on a structure of three linearly coupled optical resonators, an active one carrying a possibly arbitrary optical gain and two passive ones simply with dissipation, we demonstrate that a transmitted light field can become completely transparent through the structure, which displays all properties similar to those of EIT. Manifested by a destructive interference to annihilate the intracavity field in the resonator directly coupled to the input, this complete transparency exists for any feasible power of the transmitted field and all realizable coupling strengths of the dark resonator with the input and the neighboring resonator, as long as the inter-cavity coupling for two other resonators is adjustable over a suitable range. A free control on the transparency window size and output field intensity can be realized by tuning two inter-cavity couplings without modifying the built-in system parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解在现实近似退相干假设下，孤立量子系统中过去事件如何留下可检测记录，并探讨其对多世界诠释中分支选择问题和玻恩规则的意义。

Method: 采用退相干历史框架，对一大类随机历史进行渐近分析，并使用随机矩阵模型进行数值精确求解，以捕捉退相干的通用特征。

Result: 可靠记录数量可远少于可能事件，取决于退相干程度；在特定历史（如汉明距离小、高纯度Petz恢复态的局域历史、离群值历史）中观察到再相干；揭示了分支选择问题和玻恩规则的涌现。

Conclusion: 近似退相干严重限制了量子记录的可靠性，退相干结构为量子力学基础问题提供了新见解，特别是在多世界诠释的背景下。

Abstract: Using the framework of decoherent histories, we study which past events leave detectable records in isolated quantum systems under the realistic assumption that decoherence is approximate and not perfect. In the first part we establish -- asymptotically for a large class of (pseudo-)random histories -- that the number of reliable records can be much smaller than the number of possible events, depending on the degree of decoherence. In the second part we reveal a clear decoherence structure for long histories based on a numerically exact solution of a random matrix model that, as we argue, captures generic aspects of decoherence. We observe recoherence between histories with a small Hamming distance, for localized histories admitting a high purity Petz recovery state, and for maverick histories that are statistical outliers with respect to Born's rule. From the perspective of the Many Worlds Interpretation, the first part -- which views the self-location problem as a coherent version of quantum state discrimination -- reveals a "branch selection problem", and the second part sheds light on the emergence of Born's rule and the theory confirmation problem.

TL;DR: 对比量子系统中Krylov状态复杂度与信息几何复杂度，揭示二者分别量化状态方向扩散与轨迹体积探索的互补特性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 明确Krylov复杂度与信息几何复杂度在描述量子动力学时的本质区别，避免概念混淆

Method: 在二能级系统的Bloch球面上，分析定态/非定态哈密顿量生成的测地线/非测地线演化，将Krylov复杂度几何化（瞬时与时间平均），并与基于效率与曲率的IG复杂度对比

Result: Krylov复杂度反映演化态相对于初态的方向扩散程度，而IG复杂度刻画轨迹在Bloch球面上扫过的有效体积，二者行为不等价

Conclusion: 状态导向的Krylov复杂度与信息几何导向的IG复杂度从不同维度描述量子动力学，具有互补性而非竞争性

Abstract: We compare Krylov's state complexity with an information-geometric (IG) measure of complexity for the quantum evolution of two-level systems. Focusing on qubit dynamics on the Bloch sphere, we analyze evolutions generated by stationary and nonstationary Hamiltonians, corresponding to geodesic and nongeodesic trajectories. We formulate Krylov complexity in geometric terms, both instantaneously and in a time-averaged sense, and contrast it with an IG complexity of quantum evolutions characterized in terms of efficiency and curvature. We show that the two measures reflect fundamentally different aspects of quantum dynamics: Krylov's state complexity quantifies the directional spread of the evolving state relative to the initial state, whereas the IG complexity captures the effective volume explored along the trajectory on the Bloch sphere. This geometric distinction explains their inequivalent behavior and highlights the complementary nature of state-based and information-geometric notions of complexity in quantum systems.

Abstract: Traditionally, Quantum Information, and Quantum Communication specifically, have been focused on qubit-based architectures. Recent results, however, highlighted that higher dimensional architectures (qudit-based) may present advantages both in terms of communication and computation; a family of channels called Multi-level Amplitude Damping (MAD) channels, which are a possible qudit generalization of the well known Amplitude Damping Channels, is able to model energy decay processes that may happen during signal transmission. In this work, the Quantum Capacity of 4-dimensional MAD's is studied, relying on a technique for computing it even outside of degradable and antidegradable conditions. We also characterized the complete region of antidegradability and degradability in the parameter space for a generic d-dimensional MAD using both analytical and semi-numerical methods.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文将位置验证协议扩展为零知识版本，支持证明关于位置的时序性复杂陈述（如"我昨天中午不在某地"），同时保护位置隐私。通过引入"位置承诺"原语，结合标准量子位置验证与后量子单向函数，实现了这一目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统位置验证仅能证明当前时刻的位置，且会泄露额外位置信息。量子位置验证虽可行，但缺乏隐私保护。本文旨在实现零知识位置验证，既能证明更复杂的涉及时序的位置陈述（如不在场证明），又能隐藏除证明命题外的所有位置细节。

Method: 构造方法基于标准量子位置验证协议与后量子单向函数。核心创新是提出"位置承诺"原语——允许实体在特定时刻私密承诺其物理位置，并在之后揭示，为构建零知识证明系统提供关键工具。

Result: 成功构建了零知识位置验证协议，实现了对任意复杂位置陈述的零知识证明，同时仅依赖标准位置验证和后量子安全假设，证明了该方案的实际可行性。

Conclusion: 零知识位置验证不仅可行，还能显著增强位置隐私保护，为基于位置的服务提供更强大的隐私保障，是位置验证技术的重要理论扩展。

Abstract: Position verification schemes are interactive protocols where entities prove their physical location to others; this enables interactive proofs for statements of the form "I am at a location $L$." Although secure position verification cannot be achieved with classical protocols (even with computational assumptions), they are feasible with quantum protocols.
  In this paper we introduce the notion of zero-knowledge position verification, which generalizes position verification in two ways:
  1. enabling entities to prove more sophisticated statements about their locations at different times (for example, "I was NOT near location $L$ at noon yesterday").
  2. maintaining privacy for any other detail about their true location besides the statement they are proving.
  We construct zero-knowledge position verification from standard position verification and post-quantum one-way functions. The central tool in our construction is a primitive we call position commitments, which allow entities to privately commit to their physical position in a particular moment, which is then revealed at some later time.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Proposes using LSTM networks on raw quantum measurement trajectories instead of integrated signals to improve qubit state readout accuracy, especially for distinguishing ground states from decayed states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional clustering methods for quantum state readout fail to distinguish initial ground states from states that decayed during measurement due to T1 relaxation and low SNR, limiting error correction in superconducting qubits.

Method: Applies time-series classification (LSTM networks) with filtering and feature engineering directly to raw, non-integrated analog measurement trajectories to retain temporal information.

Result: LSTM model consistently outperforms clustering methods, with significant gains from reclassifying boundary-region points corresponding to noisy/transient features lost during signal integration.

Conclusion: Sequence-aware models like LSTMs better discriminate atypical measurement trajectories by preserving temporal dynamics, reducing misclassification errors inherent in integrated-value clustering approaches.

Abstract: Accurate quantum state readout is crucial for error correction and algorithms, but measurement errors are detrimental. Readout fidelity is typically limited by a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and energy relaxation ($T_1$ decay), a significant problem for superconducting qubits. While most approaches classify results using clustering algorithms on integrated readout signals, these methods cannot distinguish a qubit that was initially in the ground state from one that decayed to it during measurement. We instead propose using machine learning (ML) on the raw, non-integrated analog signal. We apply time-series classification models, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to the full data trajectory. We find that our LSTM model, combined with filtering and feature engineering, consistently outperforms clustering. The largest improvements come from reclassifying points in the boundary regions between clusters. These points correspond to atypical measurement records, likely due to transient or noisy features lost during data integration. By retaining temporal information, sequence-aware models like LSTMs can better discriminate these trajectories, whereas clustering methods based on integrated values are more prone to misclassification.

Abstract: We evaluate the quantum resource requirements for ATP/metaphosphate hydrolysis, one of the most important reactions in all of biology with implications for metabolism, cellular signaling, and cancer therapeutics. In particular, we consider three algorithms for solving the ground state energy estimation problem: the variational quantum eigensolver, quantum Krylov, and quantum phase estimation. By utilizing exact classical simulation, numerical estimation, and analytical bounds, we provide a current and future outlook for using quantum computers to solve impactful biochemical and biological problems. Our results show that variational methods, while being the most heuristic, still require substantially fewer overall resources on quantum hardware, and could feasibly address such problems on current or near-future devices. We include our complete dataset of biomolecular Hamiltonians and code as benchmarks to improve upon with future techniques.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种逆压缩肯尼迪接收器，用于解决S-BPSK信号判别问题，通过逆压缩算符和光子数分辨探测器实现接近Helstrom限的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二进制相移键控位移压缩真空态（S-BPSK）的判别问题，该问题在量子通信中具有重要意义。

Method: 在常规肯尼迪接收器位移操作后加入逆压缩算符，将S-BPSK信号映射为大振幅相干态，并使用光子数分辨探测器进行最大后验概率判决。

Result: 理论分析表明，在理想条件下，该接收器能将发射端的压缩资源转化为位移增益，误码率在整个能量谱范围内接近Helstrom限（3 dB常数因子）。在低光子数区域（N≈0.6），性能超越相干态极限，误码率低于1%。非理想条件下，光子数分辨探测对背景暗计数具有鲁棒性，但存在压缩参数失配导致的“奇偶光子数阶梯”饱和效应。

Conclusion: IS-Kennedy接收器能有效且鲁棒地判别S-BPSK信号，为量子通信中的信号检测提供了新方案。

Abstract: To address the discrimination problem of binary phase-shift keyed displaced squeezed vacuum states (S-BPSK), this paper proposes an Inverse-squeezing Kennedy (IS-Kennedy) receiver. This architecture incorporates an inverse-squeezing operator following the displacement operation of a conventional Kennedy receiver, mapping the S-BPSK signals onto equivalent large-amplitude coherent states. Furthermore, it employs a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector to perform maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision-making. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under ideal conditions, the IS-Kennedy receiver effectively translates the transmitter's squeezing resources into a displacement gain at the receiver. Consequently, its error probability approaches the Helstrom bound across the entire energy spectrum, remaining within a constant factor of 3 dB. In the low-photon-number regime ($N \approx 0.6$), the proposed scheme surpasses the coherent-state limit, achieving an error rate below 1\%. Furthermore, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of system performance under non-ideal conditions, revealing the robustness of PNR detection against background dark counts and a characteristic ``parity photon-number step'' saturation effect arising from squeezing parameter mismatch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管量子态数学已被广泛研究，但纠缠现象的全局几何特性尚未被充分理解。当量子系统随经典参数变化时，纤维间的粘合扭曲阻碍了全局识别，这种扭曲与纠缠有深刻联系。本文旨在从几何角度刻画纠缠的全局结构。

Method: 使用Azumaya代数描述量子系统的全局结构，将纯态空间描述为Severi-Brauer概形。通过约化到Segre簇的稳定子群来刻画子系统分解的全局存在条件，并将阻碍归结为Brauer类。

Result: 1) 量子态在Severi-Brauer概形上产生由纠缠决定的自然滤过；2) 以环面自旋系统为例，粘合的holonomy可产生纠缠量子门；3) 发现与Berry数或Chern数不同的新阻碍类；4) 即使传统认为无拓扑能带结构的系统，其本征态纠缠也能与全局几何普适量相关联。

Conclusion: 纠缠具有全局几何本质，可通过Brauer类等几何不变量刻画。这一几何视角揭示了传统非拓扑系统中纠缠的新特征，为理解量子多体系统的拓扑和几何性质提供了新框架。

Abstract: This article is an expository account aimed at viewing entanglement in finite-dimensional quantum many-body systems as a phenomenon of global geometry. While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme.
  The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme.
  Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers. For instance, even for quantum systems that have traditionally been regarded as having no topological band structure, the entanglement of their eigenstates can be related to global geometric universal quantities, reflecting the background geometry.

TL;DR: This paper studies how quantum geometric tensor (QGT) evolves after sudden Hamiltonian changes in 1D periodic systems, revealing connections between geometric properties and physical observables like wavepacket dispersion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the post-quench dynamics of quantum geometric tensor in 1D periodic systems and understand its relationship with physical quantities like variance and curvature during nonequilibrium processes.

Method: Numerical analysis using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as an example system to verify how different quenches affect QGT components, connecting them to initial state properties and post-quench band structures.

Result: QGT diagonal components correspond to position variance (metric) and energy variance; off-diagonal components show covariance (real part) and quench-induced curvature (imaginary part). Results confirm QGT is governed by initial state geometry and post-quench band properties like Berry connection and group velocities.

Conclusion: Quantum geometric tensor serves as a comprehensive probe for nonequilibrium phenomena, with direct connections to measurable physical observables during quantum quench dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate the post-quench dynamics of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of 1D periodic systems with a suddenly changed Hamiltonian. The diagonal component with respect to the crystal momentum gives a metric corresponding to the variance of the time-evolved position, and its coefficient of the quadratic term in time is the group-velocity variance, signaling ballistic wavepacket dispersion. The other diagonal QGT component with respect to time reveals the energy variance. The off-diagonal QGT component features a real part as a covariance and an imaginary part representing a quench-induced curvature. Using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as an example, our numerical results of different quenches confirm that the post-quench QGT is governed by physical quantities and local geometric objects from the initial state and post-quench bands, such as the Berry connection, group velocities, and energy variance. Furthermore, the connections between the QGT and physical observables suggest the QGT as a comprehensive probe for nonequilibrium phenomena.

Abstract: Exact synthesis provides unconditional optimality and canonical structure, but is often limited to small, carefully scoped regimes. We present an exact synthesis framework for two-qubit circuits over the Clifford+$T$ gate set that optimizes $T$-count exactly. Our approach exhausts a bounded search space, exploits algebraic canonicalization to avoid redundancy, and constructs a lookup table of optimal implementations that turns synthesis into a query. Algorithmically, we combine meet-in-the-middle ideas with provable pruning rules and problem-specific arithmetic designed for modern hardware. The result is an exact, reusable synthesis engine with substantially improved practical performance.

Abstract: We find a tight characterization of the strong converse exponent for randomness extraction against quantum side information. In contrast to previous tight bounds, we employ a composable error criterion given by the fidelity (or purified distance) to a uniform distribution in product with the marginal state. The characterization is in terms of a club-sandwiched conditional entropy recently introduced by Rubboli, Goodarzi and Tomamichel and used by Li, Li and Yu to establish the strong converse exponent for the case of classical side information. This provides the first precise operational interpretation of this family of conditional entropies in the quantum setting.

Abstract: The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is a fundamental model that describes diverse complex phenomena in nature. However, simulating the NLSE on a quantum computer is inherently challenging due to the presence of the nonlinear term. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework for simulating the NLSE based on the split-step Fourier method. During the linear propagation step, we apply the kinetic evolution operator to generate an intermediate quantum state. Subsequently, the Hadamard test is employed to measure the Fourier components of low-wavenumber modes, enabling the efficient reconstruction of nonlinear potentials. The phase transformation corresponding to the reconstructed potential is then implemented via a quantum circuit using the phase kickback technique. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we numerically simulate the evolution of a Gaussian wave packet, a soliton wave, and the wake flow past a cylinder. The simulation results demonstrate excellent agreement with the corresponding classical solutions. This work provide a concrete basis for analyzing accuracy-cost trade-offs in quantum-classical simulations of nonlinear dispersive wave dynamics.

Conclusion: 成果为高维量子信息处理提供了可扩展实现路径，深化了对量子-经典边界数学结构的理解，为验证量子优势奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) embody the fundamental trade-off between the compressibility of information into limited quantum resources and the accessibility of that information, serving as a cornerstone of quantum communication and computation. In particular, the $(n, n-1)$-QRACs, which encode $n$ bits of classical information into $n-1$ qubits, provides an ideal theoretical model for verifying quantum advantage in high-dimensional spaces; however, the analytical derivation of optimal codes for general $n$ has remained an open problem. In this paper, we establish an analytical construction method for $(n, n-1)$-QRACs by using an explicit operator formalism. We prove that this construction strictly achieves the numerically conjectured upper bound of the average success probability, $\mathcal{P} = 1/2 + \sqrt{(n-1)/n}/2$, for all $n$. Furthermore, we present a systematic algorithm to decompose the derived optimal POVM into standard quantum gates. Since the resulting decoding circuit consists solely of interactions between adjacent qubits, it can be implemented with a circuit depth of $O(n)$ even under linear connectivity constraints. Additionally, we analyze the high-dimensional limit and demonstrate that while the non-commutativity of measurements is suppressed, an information-theoretic gap of $O(\log n)$ from the Holevo bound inevitably arises for symmetric encoding.

Result: 与现有动力学甜点策略相比，Tφ提高了3-5倍，同时保持T₁在百微秒量级；由于弛豫率不能任意趋近于零，建立了T₁的可实现上限；识别出对直流和交流磁通均不敏感的双重动力学甜点区域；设计了高保真度的单量子比特和双量子比特控制协议。

Conclusion: 该框架为动力学甜点的帕累托前沿工程提供了通用工具，显著改善了超导量子比特的相干性和量子门性能。

Abstract: Operating superconducting qubits at dynamical sweet spots (DSSs) suppresses decoherence from low-frequency flux noise. A key open question is how long coherence can be extended under this strategy and what fundamental limits constrain it. Here we introduce a fully parameterized, multi-objective periodic-flux modulation framework that simultaneously optimizes energy relaxation $T_1$ and pure dephasing $T_φ$, thereby quantifying the tradeoff between them. For fluxonium qubits with realistic noise spectra, our method enhances $T_φ$ by a factor of 3-5 compared with existing DSS strategies while maintaining $T_1$ in the hundred-microsecond range. We further prove that, although DSSs eliminate first-order sensitivity to low-frequency noise, relaxation rate cannot be reduced arbitrarily close to zero, establishing an upper bound on achievable $T_1$. At the optimized working points, we identify double-DSS regions that are insensitive to both DC and AC flux, providing robust operating bands for experiments. As applications, we design single- and two-qubit control protocols at these operating points and numerically demonstrate high-fidelity gate operations. These results establish a general and useful framework for Pareto-front engineering of DSSs that substantially improves coherence and gate performance in superconducting qubits.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum device based on the graphene Josephson junctions, where the vibrational degrees of freedom of a graphene membrane couple to the superconducting circuits. The flexural mode-controlled tunneling of the Cooper pairs introduces a strong and tunable coupling even at the zero-point fluctuations level. By employing this interaction, we show that a parametric process can be efficiently implemented. We then investigate foundational and technological applications of our hybrid device empowered by nonlinear interactions, with fast generation of non-classical mechanical states, and critically enhanced quantum sensing under suitable quantum control. Our work provides the possibility of employing the graphene motional degree of freedom for quantum information processing in circuit quantum nanomechanical structures.

TL;DR: This study reveals that chemical reaction dynamics fundamentally limit precision in optical concentration measurements, showing phase measurements outperform intensity methods and sensitivity has three distinct regimes with a reaction-rate-dependent turnover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover precision limitations in spectrophotometry beyond conventional photon statistics by accounting for chemical processes that alter molecular electronic/optical properties during measurements.

Method: Applied Photon-resolved Floquet theory (extending Maxwell-Bloch for higher-order statistics) to a molecular model undergoing chemical reactions with state-dependent optical properties.

Result: Identified three sensitivity regimes (photon-shot-noise limited, chemically limited, intermediate), phase measurements > intensity sensitivity, and sensitivity turnover due to interplay between coherent electronic and incoherent chemical dynamics.

Conclusion: Chemical properties must be integrated into ultimate precision limit calculations for optical spectrophotometry, as reaction kinetics can dominate measurement uncertainty beyond photon shot noise.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate precision limitations in spectrophotometry (i.e., spectroscopic concentration measurements) imposed by chemical processes of molecules. Using the recently developed Photon-resolved Floquet theory, which generalizes Maxwell-Bloch theory for higher-order measurement statistics, we analyze a molecular model system subject to chemical reactions whose electronic and optical properties depend on the chemical state. Analysis of sensitivity bounds reveals: (i) Phase measurements are more sensitive than intensity measurements; (ii) Sensitivity exhibits three regimes: photon-shot-noise limited, chemically limited, and intermediate; (iii) Sensitivity shows a turnover as a function of reaction rate due to the interplay between coherent electronic dynamics and incoherent chemical dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that chemical properties must be considered to estimate ultimate precision limits in optical spectrophotometry.

Conclusion: 该研究为改进双向CV-QKD系统的实际部署和性能优化提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enables information-theoretically secure key generation between legitimate parties. To further enhance system performance, an improved two-way CV-QKD protocol has been proposed, which is accessible in practice and exhibits increased robustness against excess noise. However, in practical implementations, device nonidealities inevitably drive the optical field from the single-mode regime into the continuous-mode regime. In this work, we introduce temporal modes to characterize the evolution of optical fields in the improved two-way protocol and establish a security analysis framework for the continuous-mode scenario based on adaptive normalization with calibrated shot-noise unit. In addition, finite-size effects are taken into account in the analysis. Our results demonstrate that the improved two-way protocol retains a performance advantage over one-way counterpart. The analysis provides useful guidance for the practical implementation and performance optimization of improved two-way CV-QKD systems.

Motivation: Quantum frequency sensing accuracy is compromised by spurious responses to higher-order harmonics in realistic multi-frequency environments.

Method: Experimental implementation of geodesic control on a single nitrogen-vacancy center's electron spin, combined with synchronized readout.

Result: Achieved strong suppression of harmonic-induced systematic errors across MHz-GHz range and mHz-level frequency resolution under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: Geodesic control provides practical, high-accuracy quantum metrology for realistic environments with systematic experimental validation.

Abstract: Accurate frequency estimation of oscillating signals over a broad bandwidth is a central task in quantum sensing, yet it is often compromised by spurious responses to higher-order harmonics in realistic multi-frequency environments. Here we experimentally demonstrate a high-accuracy and broadband quantum frequency sensing protocol based on geodesic control, implemented using the electron spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. By engineering an intrinsically single-frequency response, geodesic control enables bias-free frequency estimation with strong suppression of harmonic-induced systematic errors across a wide spectral range spanning from the megahertz to the gigahertz regime. Furthermore, by incorporating synchronized readout, we achieve millihertz-level frequency resolution under noisy signal conditions. Our results provide systematic experimental benchmarking of geodesic control for quantum frequency sensing and establish it as a practical approach for high-accuracy metrology in realistic environments.

Motivation: Generating long-distance quantum entanglement is crucial for advancing quantum information processing.

Method: Propose a protocol in a hybrid waveguide-magnomechanical system where multiple spatially separated magnon modes couple to a common waveguide while interacting with their respective phonon modes, using tailored pulsed drives and engineered magnon-phonon interactions.

Result: The scheme enables creation of diverse long-distance and dynamically stable entanglement: basic magnon-phonon two-mode entanglement, genuine multimode entanglement between a single phonon and multiple magnons, bipartite entanglement between a single magnon and multiple phonons, and genuine four-mode entanglement involving two magnons and two phonons. Notably, dissipative magnon-magnon interactions mediated by traveling photons can generate substantially stronger long-distance entanglement than coherent couplings.

Conclusion: This work provides an experimentally feasible scheme for remote generation of magnon-phonon entanglement.

Abstract: The sensitivity of a mechanical transducer is ultimately limited by its inherent quantum fluctuations. Here, we use an optically levitated nanoparticle to measure impulsive forces smaller than the particle's zero-point momentum uncertainty. Our approach relies on reversibly squeezing the levitated particle's center-of-mass motion to coherently amplify the perturbation. We demonstrate resolving single impulsive-force kicks as small as 6.9 keV/c, a value 0.6 dB below the sensor's zero-point value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究在无限精确的位置测量后，量子粒子所处的状态是否仍可用传统的希尔伯特空间中的密度矩阵来描述，以及这种状态在后续任意投影测量下的行为特性。

Method: 考虑单位区间[0,1]中的量子粒子，先进行精度为1/n的位置测量，随后测量任意固定的归一化态|φ⟩⟨φ|的投影算符，分析当测量精度趋于无限（n→∞）时，第二个测量结果Y=1的概率极限行为。

Result: 当n→∞时，对于任意归一化态φ，第二个测量结果Y=1的概率趋于0。这表明在完美位置测量后，粒子处于一种对任何后续投影测量都给出零概率的特殊状态。

Conclusion: 由于没有任何密度矩阵（纯态或混合态）能在任意投影测量|φ⟩⟨φ|下都以零概率给出结果1，该结果表明需要用超越希尔伯特空间的新型量子态来描述完美位置测量后的量子系统。

Abstract: On a quantum particle in the unit interval $[0,1]$, perform a position measurement with inaccuracy $1/n$ and then a quantum measurement of the projection $|φ\rangle\langleφ|$ with some arbitrary but fixed normalized $φ$. Call the outcomes $X \in[0,1]$ and $Y \in\{0,1\}$. We show that in the limit $n\to\infty$ corresponding to perfect precision for $X$, the probability of $Y=1$ tends to 0 for every $φ$. Since there is no density matrix, pure or mixed, which upon measurement of any $|φ\rangle\langleφ|$ yields outcome 1 with probability 0, our result suggests that a novel type of quantum state beyond Hilbert space is necessary to describe a quantum particle after a perfect position measurement.

Abstract: Incorporating van der Waals (vdW) superconductors into Josephson elements extends circuit-QED beyond conventional Al/AlO$_x$/Al tunnel junctions and enables microwave probes of unconventional condensates and subgap excitations. In this work, we realize a flux-tunable transmon whose nonlinear inductive element is an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction. The tunnel barrier is formed by sequential deposition and full in-situ oxidation of ultrathin Al layers on an exfoliated 4Hb-TaS$_2$ flake, followed by deposition of a top Al electrode, yielding a robust, repeatable hybrid junction process compatible with standard transmon fabrication. Embedding the device in a three-dimensional copper cavity, we observe a SQUID-like flux-dependent spectrum that is quantitatively reproduced by a standard dressed transmon--cavity Hamiltonian, from which we extract parameters in the transmon regime. Across measured devices we obtain sub-microsecond energy relaxation ($T_1$ from $0.08$ to $0.69~μ$s), while Ramsey measurements indicate dephasing faster than our $16$ ns time resolution. We also find a pronounced discrepancy between the Josephson energy inferred from spectroscopy and that expected from the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation using room-temperature junction resistances, pointing to nontrivial junction physics in the hybrid Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ system. Although we do not resolve material-specific subgap modes in the present geometry, this work establishes a practical route to integrating 4Hb-TaS$_2$ into coherent quantum circuits and provides a baseline for future edge-sensitive designs aimed at enhancing coupling to boundary and subgap degrees of freedom in vdW superconductors.

Abstract: Linear oscillators contribute to most branches of contemporary quantum science. They have already successfully served as quantum sensors and memories, found applications in quantum communication, and hold promise for cluster-state-based quantum computing. To master universal quantum processing with linear oscillators, an unconditional nonlinear operation is required. We propose such an operation using light-mediated interaction with another system that possesses a nonlinearity equivalent to more than a quadratic potential. Such a potential grants access to a nonlinear operation that can be broadcast to the target linear system. The nonlinear character of the operation can be verified by observing adequate negative values of the target system's Wigner function and the squeezing of the variance of a certain nonlinear combination of the quadratures below the thresholds attainable by Gaussian states. We explicitly evaluate an optically levitated mechanical oscillator as a flexible source of nonlinearity for a proof-of-principle demonstration of the nonlinearity broadcasting to linear systems, for example, mechanical oscillators or macroscopic atomic spin ensembles.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: DynQ is a dynamic, topology-agnostic Quantum Virtual Machine that uses quality-weighted community detection on live calibration data to virtualize quantum processors, creating adaptive, noise-aware execution regions that maximize internal gate quality while minimizing inter-region coupling, enabling resource sharing and higher fidelity for quantum cloud services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantum cloud platforms lack virtualization—each user monopolizes entire quantum processors, preventing resource sharing, economic scalability, and quality-of-service differentiation. Existing Quantum Virtual Machine approaches are brittle and fail under real-world hardware challenges including heterogeneity, calibration drift, and transient defects.

Method: DynQ models quantum processors as weighted graphs derived from live calibration data and applies quality-weighted community detection to automatically discover optimal execution regions. It implements the classical virtualization principle of high cohesion and low coupling in a quantum-native setting, producing connectivity-efficient, noise-aware, and resilient execution regions that adapt dynamically to hardware conditions.

Result: Evaluated across five IBM Quantum backends using calibration-derived noise simulation and on two production devices, DynQ achieved up to 19.1% higher fidelity and 45.1% lower output error compared to state-of-the-art QVM and standard compilation baselines. When transient hardware defects caused baseline executions to fail completely, DynQ adapted dynamically and maintained over 86% fidelity.

Conclusion: DynQ transforms calibrated device graphs into adaptive virtual hardware abstractions, successfully decoupling quantum programs from fragile physical layouts and enabling reliable, high-utilization quantum cloud services with quality-of-service differentiation.

Abstract: Quantum cloud platforms remain fundamentally non-virtualised: despite rapid hardware scaling, each user program still monopolises an entire quantum processor, preventing resource sharing, economic scalability, and quality-of-service differentiation. Existing Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) designs attempt spatial multiplexing through topology-specific or template-based partitioning, but these approaches are brittle under hardware heterogeneity, calibration drift, and transient defects, which dominate real quantum devices. We present DynQ, the first dynamic, topology-agnostic Quantum Virtual Machine that virtualises quantum hardware using quality-weighted community detection. Instead of imposing fixed geometric regions, DynQ models a quantum processor as a weighted graph derived from live calibration data and automatically discovers execution regions that maximise internal gate quality while minimising inter-region coupling. This operationalises the classical virtualisation principle of high cohesion and low coupling in a quantum-native setting, producing execution regions that are connectivity-efficient, noise-aware, and resilient to crosstalk and defects. We evaluate DynQ across five IBM Quantum backends using calibration-derived noise simulation and on two production devices, comparing against state-of-the-art QVM and standard compilation baselines. On hardware with pronounced spatial quality variation, DynQ achieves up to 19.1 percent higher fidelity and 45.1 percent lower output error. When transient hardware defects cause baseline executions to fail completely, DynQ adapts dynamically and achieves over 86 percent fidelity. By transforming calibrated device graphs into adaptive virtual hardware abstractions, DynQ decouples quantum programs from fragile physical layouts and enables reliable, high-utilisation quantum cloud services.

*Ian Tan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper establishes a mathematical bijection between maximally entangled quantum states and quantum error-correcting codes, proving their uniqueness for 4 qutrits and revealing deep connections between their symmetry structures using Lie algebra theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental relationship between absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states and quantum error-correcting codes, which could provide new insights into both quantum many-body physics and quantum information protection.

Method: Proving a bijection between local unitary orbits of AME states and quantum codes; applying previous classification results; using Vinberg's theory of graded Lie algebras to compute generators of symmetry and transversal gate groups.

Result: 1) A bijection between LU orbits of AME states in (C^D)^⊗n (n even) and ((n-1,D,n/2))_D quantum codes; 2) Uniqueness of 4-qutrit AME state and ((3,3,2))_3 code up to LU transformations; 3) Close relationship between code's transversal gate group and AME state's local symmetry group; 4) Generators for both groups found via Vinberg's theory.

Conclusion: AME states and quantum error-correcting codes represent equivalent mathematical structures under local unitary equivalence, with their symmetry groups deeply connected. This reveals a profound duality between entanglement and quantum error correction, providing powerful algebraic tools for future classification efforts in quantum information science.

Abstract: We provide a proof that there exists a bijection between local unitary (LU) orbits of absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states in $(\mathbb{C}^D)^{\otimes n}$ where $n$ is even, also known as perfect tensors, and LU orbits of $((n-1,D,n/2))_D$ quantum error correcting codes. Thus, by a result of Rather et al. (2023), the AME state of 4 qutrits and the pure $((3,3,2))_3$ qutrit code $\mathcal{C}$ are both unique up to the action of the LU group. We further explore the connection between the 4-qutrit AME state and the code $\mathcal{C}$ by showing that the group of transversal gates of $\mathcal{C}$ and the group of local symmetries of the AME state are closely related. Taking advantage of results from Vinberg's theory of graded Lie algebras, we find generators of both of these groups.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for fast, robust and high-fidelity topological quantum state transfer in one-dimensional systems with long-range couplings, motivated by chains of Rydberg atoms with dipole-dipole interactions. Such long-range interactions naturally give rise to extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models supporting topologically protected edge states. We show that these edge states enable high-fidelity edge-to-edge excitation transfer using both time-independent protocols, based on coherent edge state dynamics, and time-dependent protocols, based on adiabatic modulation of system parameters. Long-range couplings play a central role by enhancing the relevant energy gaps, leading to a substantial improvement in transfer efficiency compared to nearest neighbour models. The resulting transfer is robust against positional disorder, reflecting its topological origin and highlighting the potential of long-range interacting platforms for reliable quantum state transfer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有经典场修饰量子比特的控制协议会产生非期望的非旋转项（CRT），迫使系统运行在旋转波近似（RWA）成立的受限区域，从而限制了量子比特的操作性能。

Method: 在实验室坐标系中仅使用单一耦合轴，设计一种能最优消除非旋转项（CRT）的修饰量子比特控制协议，避免使用旋转波近似（RWA），同时提供通用参数化方法及基于Floquet理论的相干时间表达式以阐明协议原理并降低采用门槛。

Result: 该协议在单量子比特门速度、双量子比特门保真度、光谱范围、时钟稳定性和相干保持等多个性能指标上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方案成为量子比特控制的最新策略，为利用修饰量子比特架构实现更广泛的量子技术铺平了道路。

Abstract: The applicability and performance of qubits dressed by classical fields are limited because their control protocols give rise to an undesired counter-rotating term (CRT). This in turn forces operation in a regime where a (dressed) rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is valid, thereby restricting key aspects of their operation. Here, using only a single coupling axis in the laboratory frame, we introduce a dressed-qubit control protocol that optimally removes the CRT, eliminating the need for the RWA and delivering substantial improvements in multiple performance metrics, including single-qubit gate speed, two-qubit gate fidelity, spectroscopic range, clock stability, and coherence preservation. In addition, we provide a general parameterization together with a Floquet-based coherence-time expression, which elucidates the protocol's working principles and lowers the barrier to adoption. Collectively, these advances position our scheme as the state-of-the-art strategy for qubit control, paving the way for a wider class of quantum technologies to be realized using dressed-qubit architectures.

Conclusion: 该极简双模框架成功捕捉了黑洞蒸发过程中能量转移与信息流动的关键定性特征。

Abstract: We develop and analyze a two-oscillator model for black hole evaporation in which an effective geometric degree of freedom and a representative Hawking radiation mode are described by coupled harmonic oscillators with opposite signs in their free Hamiltonians. The normal-mode structure is obtained analytically and the corresponding modal amplitudes determine the pattern of energy exchange between the two sectors. To bridge the discrete and semiclassical pictures, we introduce smooth envelope functions that provide a continuous effective description along the geometric variable. Numerical simulations in a truncated Fock space show that the two oscillators exchange quanta in an approximately out-of-phase manner, consistent with an effective conservation of $\langle n_x\rangle - \langle n_y\rangle$. The reduced entropy $S_x(t)$ exhibits periodic growth, indicating entanglement generation. These results demonstrate that even a minimal two-mode framework can capture key qualitative features of energy transfer and information flow during evaporation.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Q-PreSyn uses reinforcement learning to optimize quantum circuit representations before synthesis, reducing expensive T-gates by up to 20% without added error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T-gates dominate fault-tolerant quantum computing costs; current local synthesis methods yield suboptimal T-counts due to circuit representation dependency

Method: RL agent identifies sequences of equivalence-preserving local edits to preprocess circuits, improving subsequent Clifford+T synthesis outcomes

Result: Achieves 20% average T-count reduction on 25-qubit circuits when combined with existing synthesis algorithms

Conclusion: Pre-synthesis representation optimization via RL effectively lowers fault-tolerant resource requirements, enabling more circuits to run within hardware constraints

Abstract: Compiling quantum circuits into Clifford+$T$ gates is a central task for fault-tolerant quantum computing using stabilizer codes. In the near term, $T$ gates will dominate the cost of fault tolerant implementations, and any reduction in the number of such expensive gates could mean the difference between being able to run a circuit or not. While exact synthesis is exponentially hard in the number of qubits, local synthesis approaches are commonly used to compile large circuits by decomposing them into substructures. However, composing local methods leads to suboptimal compilations in key metrics such as $T$-count or circuit depth, and their performance strongly depends on circuit representation. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing \textsc{Q-PreSyn}, a strategy that, given a set of local edits preserving circuit equivalence, uses a RL agent to identify effective sequences of such actions and thereby obtain circuit representations that yield a reduced $T$-count upon synthesis. Experimental results of our proposed strategy, applied on top of well-known synthesis algorithms, show up to a $20\%$ reduction in $T$-count on circuits with up to 25 qubits, without introducing any additional approximation error prior to synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近-term超导量子处理器需要有效的基准测试方法来评估性能。该研究旨在将Wigner朋友电路中的分支间信息传递作为一个实用的基准测试工具，以比较不同IBM处理器（Eagle、Nighthawk、Heron）在实际运行中的表现。

Method: 研究团队实现了Violaris提出的信息传递酉原语，在IBM Eagle、Nighthawk和Heron处理器上测试了最大规模达32量子比特的信息传递。他们设计了三种信息家族（稀疏/单热、半权重、稠密），测量了条件字符串成功率p_all、非计算后的内存擦除情况，以及分支对比度和按位互信息等关联诊断指标，且未使用任何误差缓解技术。

Result: 稀疏信息家族编译后具有基本恒定的双量子比特深度，可作为深度控制的设备噪声探针；在n=32时，p_all值在不同后端间跨度约为0.07至0.68。相比之下，半权重和稠密信息由于路由开销快速增长，且编译器种子变异性在相干前沿附近成为实际限制。研究还完成了幅度扫描（无放大测试）和散度"表亲"扫描，量化了分支条件复杂度带来的性能退化。

Conclusion: 稀疏信息家族是评估当前量子处理器性能的理想基准测试工具，其恒定深度特性使其能有效隔离设备噪声。研究结果揭示了不同信息类型在真实量子设备上的性能差异，并表明编译器优化的一致性是关键挑战。所有实验数据和绘图脚本已公开。

Abstract: We treat inter-branch message transfer in a Wigner's-friend circuit as a practical benchmark for near-term superconducting quantum processors. Implementing Violaris' unitary message-transfer primitive, we compare performance across IBM Eagle, Nighthawk, and Heron (r2/r3) processors for message sizes up to $n=32$, without error mitigation. We study three message families -- sparse (one-hot), half-weight, and dense -- and measure conditional string success $p_{\mathrm{all}}=\Pr(P=μ\mid R=0)$, memory erasure after uncomputation, and correlation diagnostics (branch contrast and bitwise mutual information). The sparse family compiles to essentially constant two-qubit depth, yielding a depth-controlled probe of device noise: at $n=32$ we observe $p_{\mathrm{all}}$ spanning $\approx0.07$ to $\approx0.68$ across backends. In contrast, half and dense messages incur rapidly growing routing overhead, and transpiler-seed variability becomes a practical limitation near the coherence frontier. We further report an amplitude sweep (no-amplification test) and a divergence ``cousins'' sweep that quantifies degradation with branch-conditioned complexity. All data and figure-generation scripts are released.

*Satoshi Kanno,Yoshi-aki Shimada*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A geometric framework using spectral triples in noncommutative geometry reformulates quantum error correction codes as spectral projections of Dirac operators, unifying various code types and linking error correction performance to spectral properties like the Dirac operator's gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified geometric perspective on quantum error correction that encompasses both classical and quantum codes, and to connect error correction performance directly to geometric/spectral properties for enhanced understanding and code optimization.

Method: Reformulating quantum error correcting codes as low-energy spectral projections of Dirac-type operators in noncommutative geometry, separating global logical degrees of freedom from local correctable errors.

Result: Recovers all major code families (classical linear, stabilizer, GKP, topological) from a single construction; shows leakage is controlled by spectral gap; provides geometric mechanism to enhance error correction thresholds by increasing gap without changing logical subspace; interprets Berezin-Toeplitz quantization as mixed spectral code.

Conclusion: Quantum error correction is a universal low-energy phenomenon governed by spectral geometry, offering a powerful unified language for understanding and designing error-correcting codes.

Abstract: We present a new geometric perspective on quantum error correction based on spectral triples in noncommutative geometry. In this approach, quantum error correcting codes are reformulated as low energy spectral projections of Dirac type operators that separate global logical degrees of freedom from local, correctable errors. Locality, code distance, and the Knill Laflamme condition acquire a unified spectral and geometric interpretation in terms of the induced metric and spectrum of the Dirac operator. Within this framework, a wide range of known error correcting codes including classical linear codes, stabilizer codes, GKP type codes, and topological codes are recovered from a single construction. This demonstrates that classical and quantum codes can be organized within a common geometric language. A central advantage of the spectral triple perspective is that the performance of error correction can be directly related to spectral properties. We show that leakage out of the code space is controlled by the spectral gap of the Dirac operator, and that code preserving internal perturbations can systematically increase this gap without altering the encoded logical subspace. This yields a geometric mechanism for enhancing error correction thresholds, which we illustrate explicitly for a stabilizer code. We further interpret Berezin Toeplitz quantization as a mixed spectral code and briefly discuss implications for holographic quantum error correction. Overall, our results suggest that quantum error correction can be viewed as a universal low energy phenomenon governed by spectral geometry.

*Ievgen I. Arkhipov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper resolves gauge ambiguities in non-Hermitian Berry connections by developing a covariant-derivative formalism based on the Hilbert space metric tensor, yielding a unique, real-valued geometric framework that reduces to standard Hermitian theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique spectral and topological phenomena, but their geometric characterization is hindered by a fundamental gauge ambiguity arising from the biorthogonal structure of left and right eigenvectors, leading to multiple inequivalent definitions of Berry connections with complex-valued phases.

Method: The authors introduce a covariant-derivative formalism constructed from the metric tensor of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian's Hilbert space, providing a gauge-invariant foundation for defining geometric phases.

Result: This approach yields a unique Berry connection that remains real-valued under arbitrary GL(N,C) gauge transformations, transforms as an affine gauge potential, and correctly reduces to the conventional Berry connection in the Hermitian limit.

Conclusion: The work establishes an unambiguous, gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in non-Hermitian quantum systems, resolving long-standing ambiguities in their geometric description.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting unique Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

Conclusion: This work bridges fundamental quantum metrology theory with practical implementation, offering a scalable solution for broadband weak-signal detection across physics frontiers.

Abstract: Broadband detection of a weak oscillatory field with unknown carrier frequency underlies magnetometry, axion searches and gravitational-wave sensing. We show that the Grover-like integration-time lower bound for this task is a geometric corollary an upper bound on the integrated quantum Fisher information, a metrological constraint. We further give an all-analog multi-resonant protocol based on a randomized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger control Hamiltonian and an m-register GHZ probe and verify near-optimal scaling through simulation.

Result: ...

Conclusion: ...

Abstract: The minimum error probability for distinguishing between two quantum states is bounded by the Helstrom limit, derived under the assumption that measurement strategies are restricted to positive operator-valued measurements. We explore scenarios in which the error probability for discriminating two quantum states can be reduced below the Helstrom bound under some constrained access of resources, indicating the use of measurement operations that go beyond the standard positive operator-valued measurements framework. We refer to such measurements as non-positive operator-valued measurements. While existing literature often associates these measurements with initial entanglement between the system and an auxiliary, followed by joint projective measurement and discarding the auxiliary, we demonstrate that initial entanglement between system and auxiliary is not necessary for the emergence of such measurements in the context of state discrimination. Interestingly, even initial product states can give rise to effective non-positive measurements on the subsystem, and achieve sub-Helstrom discrimination error when discriminating quantum states of the subsystem.

TL;DR: This paper leverages qubit shuttling to achieve 3D connectivity on 2D quantum hardware, enabling constant-time logical gates via folded surface codes and drastically improving magic-state distillation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the limitation of 2D quantum hardware (e.g., semiconductor spin/ion qubits) where conventional surface code operations require O(d) runtime and face routing bottlenecks, hindering scalability.

Method: Proposes a scalable architecture using short-range qubit shuttling to create effective 3D connectivity on 2D devices, combined with folded surface code protocols and a novel "virtual-stack" layout for multilayer routing.

Result: Reduces single-qubit Clifford and CNOT gate runtime from O(d) to constant time; cuts magic-state distillation spacetime volume by >10× with transversal S gate; enables efficient multilayer routing via virtual-stack layout.

Conclusion: Qubit shuttling transforms 2D hardware into a scalable platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation by natively supporting 3D-like connectivity, significantly accelerating logical operations and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Qubit shuttling has become an indispensable ingredient for scaling leading quantum computing platforms, including semiconductor spin, neutral-atom, and trapped-ion qubits, enabling both crosstalk reduction and tighter integration of control hardware. Cai et al. (2023) proposed a scalable architecture that employs short-range shuttling to realize effective three-dimensional connectivity on a strictly two-dimensional device. Building on recent advances in quantum error correction, we show that this architecture enables the native implementation of folded surface codes on 2D hardware, reducing the runtime of all single-qubit logical Clifford gates and logical CNOTs within subsets of qubits from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ in conventional surface code lattice surgery to constant time. We present explicit protocols for these operations and demonstrate that access to a transversal $S$ gate reduces the spacetime volume of 8T-to-CCZ magic-state distillation by more than an order of magnitude compared with standard 2D lattice surgery approaches. Finally, we introduce a new "virtual-stack" layout that more efficiently exploits the quasi-three-dimensional structure of the architecture, enabling efficient multilayer routing on these two-dimensional devices.

Abstract: Low check weight is practically crucial code property for fault-tolerant quantum computing, which underlies the strong interest in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. Here, we explore the theory of weight-constrained stabilizer codes from various foundational perspectives including the complexity of computing code weight and the explicit boundary of feasible low-weight codes in both theoretical and practical settings. We first prove that calculating the optimal code weight is an $\mathsf{NP}$-hard problem, demonstrating the necessity of establishing bounds for weight that are analytical or efficiently computable. Then we systematically investigate the feasible code parameters with weight constraints. We provide various explicit analytical lower bounds and in particular completely characterize stabilizer codes with weight at most 3, showing that they have distance 2 and code rate at most 1/4. We also develop a powerful linear programming (LP) scheme for setting code parameter bounds with weight constraints, which yields exact optimal weight values for all code parameters with $n\leq 9$. We further refined this constraint from multiple perspectives by considering the generator weight distribution and overlap. In particular, we consider practical architectures and demonstrate how to apply our methods to e.g.~the IBM 127-qubit chip. Our study brings the weight as a crucial parameter into coding theory and provide guidance for code design and utility in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Graph states provide a powerful framework for describing multipartite entanglement in quantum information science. In their standard formulation, graph states are generated by controlled-$Z$ interactions and naturally encode symmetric exchange properties. Here we establish a precise correspondence between graph topology and exchange symmetry by proving that a graph state is fully symmetric under particle permutations if and only if the underlying graph is complete. We then introduce a generalized graph-based construction using a non-commutative two-qudit gate, denoted $GR$, which requires directed edges and an explicit vertex ordering. We show that complete directed graphs endowed with appropriate orientations, for an odd number of qudits generate fully antisymmetric multipartite states. Together, these results provide a unified graph-theoretic description of bosonic and fermionic exchange symmetry based on graph completeness and edge orientation.

Abstract: Distinct monitoring or intervention schemes can produce different conditioned stochastic quantum trajectories while sharing the same unconditional (ensemble-averaged) dynamics. This is the essence of unravelings of a given Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation: any trajectory-ensemble average of a function that is linear in the conditional state is completely determined by the unconditional density matrix, whereas applying a nonlinear function before averaging can yield unraveling-dependent results beyond the average evolution. A paradigmatic example is resonance fluorescence, where direct photodetection (jump/Poisson) and homodyne or heterodyne detection (diffusive/Wiener) define inequivalent unravelings of the same GKSL dynamics. In earlier work, we showed that nonlinear trajectory averages can distinguish such unravelings, but observing the effect in that optical setting requires demanding experimental precision. Here we translate the same idea to a digital setting by introducing synthetic unravelings implemented as quantum circuits acting on one and two qubits. We design two unravelings - a projective measurement unraveling and a random-unitary "kick" unraveling - that share the same ensemble-averaged evolution while yielding different nonlinear conditional-state statistics. We implement the protocols on superconducting-qubit hardware provided by IBM Quantum to access trajectory-level information. We show that the variance across trajectories and the ensemble-averaged von Neumann entropy distinguish the unravelings in both theory and experiment, while the unconditional state and the ensemble-averaged expectation values that are linear in the state remain identical. Our results provide an accessible demonstration that quantum trajectories encode information about measurement backaction beyond what is fixed by the unconditional dynamics.

TL;DR: This paper discovers a new wave localization regime called erratic non-Hermitian skin localization (ENHSL) where ballistic transport occurs despite strong spectral localization, enabled by disorder in non-Hermitian lattices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional understanding holds that disorder impedes transport through localization, but this work explores whether distinct localization regimes with unexpected transport properties exist in non-Hermitian systems.

Method: Experimental realization using an acoustic lattice implementing a disordered Hatano-Nelson chain with imaginary gauge fields, combined with Green's-function spectroscopy and time-resolved measurements to reconstruct complex spectra and observe wave dynamics.

Result: Observed ENHSL characterized by macroscopic disorder-dependent localization at irregular positions with subexponential decay, yet remarkably exhibiting ballistic transport. Theoretical analysis revealed connection to random walk statistics (Levy-arcsine) within an expanding light cone.

Conclusion: ENHSL decouples eigenstate localization from transport behavior, establishing a new paradigm for wave dynamics where ballistic transport coexists with strong spectral localization, with universal statistical properties linked to random walks.

Abstract: Localization is a pervasive phenomenon across physics, shaping transport from electrons in solids to light and sound in engineered media. In traditional settings, disorder strongly impedes transport, resulting in dynamical localization or, at best, sub-ballistic or diffusive dynamics. A distinct and previously unobserved regime, erratic non-Hermitian skin localization (ENHSL), can arise in globally reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices with disorder. It features macroscopic, disorder-dependent localization at irregular bulk positions with subexponential decay, linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. We realize this regime experimentally in an acoustic lattice implementing a disordered Hatano-Nelson chain with imaginary gauge fields. Using Green's-function-based spectroscopy together with time-resolved measurements on the same platform, we reconstruct the full complex spectrum and eigenstates, and directly observe wave-packet dynamics. Remarkably, we observe ballistic transport despite strong spectral localization. We develop a transport theory that connects the dominant propagation site to the maximal random-walk excursion within an expanding light cone and predicts a universal Levy-arcsine statistics, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Our results decouple eigenstate localization from transport and establish ENHSL as a new paradigm for wave dynamics.

Abstract: Identifying superconducting states of matter without prior assumptions is a central challenge in strongly correlated electron systems. We introduce a canonical framework for diagnosing the formation of Cooper pair condensates based on the Penrose-Onsager criterion, in which superconducting order is encoded in the spectral properties of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM). Within this formulation, the symmetry and structure of the condensate are obtained by projecting the 2RDM onto irreducible representations of the underlying symmetry group, enabling an unbiased identification of both conventional and exotic superconducting states. We demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach through applications to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using both auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For attractive interactions without a magnetic field, we reveal a clear finite-size scaling of the condensate fraction on square lattices of size up to $20\times 20$. The framework further provides direct access to the internal structure and extent of Cooper pairs, which we track across the BCS-BEC crossover. Moreover, it enables a clean diagnosis of the finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in a magnetic field. Finally, we apply the approach to a supersolid phase in the repulsive Hubbard model with an additional next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^\prime$, where a charge-density wave coexists with a superconductor. We confirm the fragmented nature of the condensate and uncover substantial pairing correlations in the triplet channel with $p$-wave spatial symmetry in addition to the dominant singlet $d$-wave pairing. Our results establish the 2RDM-based Penrose-Onsager framework as a broadly applicable and unbiased tool for characterizing superconducting order in correlated quantum matter.

Conclusion: The navigation strategy provides a practical, hardware-modification-free alternative compatible with standard fabrication, enabling STM studies of miniaturized 2D devices and emerging quantum phenomena.

Abstract: We report the design and fabrication of guiding patterns for topography-based searching of two-dimensional (2D) devices for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements. Sub-micron geometric coordinate markers were etched into SiO2/Si wafers, serving as both substrates for 2D device integration and guiding maps for sample navigation. Here, we used a monolayer graphene/h-BN device with an active area of smaller than 20 um x 20 um as a model system and demonstrated that the device could be reliably located in STM solely through topographic imaging of the guiding patterns and in situ stage calibration, without reliance on optical viewports or capacitive sensing. Atomically resolved topographic imaging and tunneling spectroscopy were also obtained. Our proposed navigation strategy is fully compatible with standard device fabrication procedures and requires no hardware modification to existing STM setups. As such, it offers a practical alternative for locating miniaturized devices in STM, shedding light on studying emerging quantum phenomena in 2D systems.

Motivation: Altermagnets exhibit unique symmetry breaking (time-reversal + rotational) without net magnetization, with order parameters analogous to magnetic multipoles that couple to combined magnetic field and strain - requiring new experimental probes for their critical behavior.

Conclusion: This work provides a methodology to experimentally access altermagnetic critical phenomena, paving the way for studying quantum criticality in d-wave altermagnets and related materials.

Abstract: Altermagnets break a combination of time-reversal and rotational symmetries without generating a net magnetization. As such, the order parameter of $d$-wave altermagnets has the same symmetry as magnetic multipoles, and couples to the product of a magnetic field and uniaxial strain. We combine elastocaloric experiments, free-energy modeling, and first-principles calculations on MnF$_2$ to establish a thermodynamic probe of the predicted finite-temperature altermagnetic critical point. These results pave the way to explore altermagnetic quantum criticality in $d$-wave materials and beyond.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 该研究在Kitaev模型中引入时间反演破缺的三自旋项(κ)，发现涡旋满 sector 的基态具有偶数陈数，且孤立的无涡旋六边形 plaquet 作为"对偶涡旋"可在体隙中束缚一个费米子模，该模等价于两个耦合的马约拉纳零模。通过连续近似解析计算了小/大κ极限下的波函数与耦合能ε，并经格点微扰理论和有限尺寸数值验证，结果与拓扑超导体中传统涡旋束缚态形成对比。

Abstract: The Kitaev model is exactly solvable in terms of Majorana fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice and coupled to a static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field, giving the possibility of $π$-vortices in hexagonal plaquettes. In the vortex-full sector and in the presence of a time-reversal-breaking three-spin term of strength $κ$, the energy spectrum is gapped and the ground state possesses an even Chern number. An isolated vortex-free plaquette acts as a ``dual vortex'' and binds a fermionic mode at finite energy $ε$ in the bulk gap. This mode is equivalent to two coupled Majorana zero modes located on the same dual vortex. In a continuum approximation, we analytically compute the Majorana wavefunctions and their coupling $ε$ in the two limits of small or large $κ$. The analytical approach is confirmed by numerical perturbation theory directly on the lattice. The latter is in excellent agreement with the full numerics on a finite-size system. We contrast our results with states bound to an isolated vortex in a topological superconductor with even Chern number.

*Hongqin Xiao,Geng Li,Yuxuan He,Ke Zhu,Yuhan Ye,Yumeng Li,Lijing Huang,Haitao Yang,Ziqiang Wang,Hong-Jun Gao*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: First experimental observation of Wigner-Mott insulator in 6R-TaS₂ via STM electron injection, revealing a √3×√3 charge-ordered state requiring both onsite (U) and long-range Coulomb (V) interactions at fractional filling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wigner-Mott insulators—theorized to arise from cooperative onsite (U) and inter-site (V) Coulomb interactions at fractional electron fillings—had never been experimentally realized, leaving their mechanism unverified.

Method: Used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to locally inject electrons into 6R-TaS₂, inducing Star-of-David charge-ordered superstructures and mapping insulating phase transitions.

Result: Identified a √3×√3 superstructure as a Wigner-Mott insulating state with a robust Mott gap at fractional filling, distinct from the conventional 1×1 Mott state (U-dominated at integer filling); both U and V are essential for the fractional state.

Conclusion: Provides direct microscopic evidence for the Wigner-Mott mechanism and establishes a controllable platform for studying correlated electron states driven by long-range interactions.

Abstract: Wigner-Mott insulating states represent a paradigmatic manifestation of strong electronic correlations, in which long-range Coulomb interactions drive spontaneous charge ordering and enable Mott localization at fractional electronic fillings. Such states have been theoretically proposed to arise from the cooperative interplay between onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. However, experimental realization of a Wigner-Mott insulator has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a Wigner-Mott insulating states in 6R-TaS$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy. By locally injecting electrons into the depleted 1T layer, we induce distinct Star-of-David charge-ordered superstructures and realize a cascade of insulating phases. In particular, a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ superstructure constitutes a Wigner-Mott insulating state, characterized by a robust Mott gap despite fractional filling. Comparative measurements reveal that the conventional 1$\times$1 Mott state at integer filling is governed predominantly by onsite interaction U, whereas the $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ fractional-filling Mott state requires the cooperative effects of both U and long-range Coulomb interaction V. Our results provide not only the direct microscopic evidence for a Wigner-Mott mechanism, but also establish a platform for the controllable realization and investigation of Wigner-Mott insulating states.

TL;DR: 提出一种时域迭代方案求解DMFT自洽方程，直接在实时使用延迟格林函数，适用于近期量子计算硬件，成功在Bethe晶格上模拟了Hubbard模型的金属-绝缘体转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DMFT在虚时或频率空间运算，不适合量子硬件；两点DMFT近似存在谱特征捕捉不足的局限；量子计算机在实时传播方面可通过Trotter化或变分算法高效实现。

Method: 将有效杂质问题映射到含少量浴位点的有限一维链，用精确对角化求解；通过时域拟合迭代更新杂化函数直至达到自洽。

Result: 在半填充Hubbard模型上实现稳定收敛，清晰展示了不同相互作用强度下的金属-绝缘体转变、Hubbard带形成和费米能级处谱权重抑制。

Conclusion: 克服了传统两点DMFT的局限，在保持效率的同时提供详细谱特征，通过实时动力学实现与量子计算平台的兼容性，为近期量子硬件上的DMFT模拟提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present a time-domain iteration scheme for solving the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) self-consistent equations using retarded Green's functions in real time. Unlike conventional DMFT approaches that operate in imaginary time or frequency space, our scheme operates directly with real-time quantities. This makes it particularly suitable for near-term quantum computing hardware with limited Hilbert spaces, where real-time propagation can be efficiently implemented via Trotterization or variational quantum algorithms. We map the effective impurity problem to a finite one-dimensional chain with a small number of bath sites, solved via exact diagonalization as a proof-of-concept. The hybridization function is iteratively updated through time-domain fitting until self-consistency. We demonstrate stable convergence across a wide range of interaction strengths for the half-filled Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice, successfully capturing the metal-to-insulator transition. Despite using limited time resolution and a minimal bath discretization, the spectral functions clearly exhibit the emergence of Hubbard bands and the suppression of spectral weight at the Fermi level as interaction strength increases. This overcomes major limitations of two-site DMFT approximations by delivering detailed spectral features while preserving efficiency and compatibility with quantum computing platforms through real-time dynamics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This position paper proposes Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS) that leverage generative AI and process mining to shift BPM from task automation to full autonomy, enabling a continuum from human-driven to fully autonomous processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of Generative and Agentic AI represents a fundamentally different wave in BPM evolution, shifting focus from design-driven automation to data-driven autonomy, which requires new architectural approaches to support agentic capabilities in process management.

Method: Based on a keynote at the 2025 Workshop on AI for BPM, the paper outlines how process mining provides foundational capabilities (sensing, reasoning, acting) and proposes an architectural vision for A-BPMS integrating autonomy, reasoning, and learning.

Result: The paper presents an A-BPMS architectural framework that supports a continuum of processes ranging from human-driven to fully autonomous, redefining traditional boundaries of automation and governance in business process management.

Conclusion: Agentic BPM systems will transform process management by enabling data-driven, autonomous optimization across the entire spectrum of human-to-machine execution, fundamentally reshaping process automation and governance paradigms.

Abstract: Since the early 90s, the evolution of the Business Process Management (BPM) discipline has been punctuated by successive waves of automation technologies. Some of these technologies enable the automation of individual tasks, while others focus on orchestrating the execution of end-to-end processes. The rise of Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening the way for another such wave. However, this wave is poised to be different because it shifts the focus from automation to autonomy and from design-driven management of business processes to data-driven management, leveraging process mining techniques. This position paper, based on a keynote talk at the 2025 Workshop on AI for BPM, outlines how process mining has laid the foundations on top of which agents can sense process states, reason about improvement opportunities, and act to maintain and optimize performance. The paper proposes an architectural vision for Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS): a new class of platforms that integrate autonomy, reasoning, and learning into process management and execution. The paper contends that such systems must support a continuum of processes, spanning from human-driven to fully autonomous, thus redefining the boundaries of process automation and governance.

TL;DR: 本文提出LLaMEA框架，通过大语言模型与进化循环结合生成具有指定景观特性的多样化优化问题，解决BBOB等现有测试套件结构多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续黑盒优化基准测试套件（如BBOB）的结构多样性有限，阻碍了算法的充分评估，亟需生成具有明确高层景观特性且可解释、可复现的基准问题。

Method: 利用LLaMEA框架引导大语言模型根据目标特性（多模态性、可分离性、盆地大小同质性、搜索空间同质性、全局-局部最优对比）的自然语言描述生成问题代码；在进化循环中通过ELA特性预测器评估候选解，并引入ELA空间适应度共享机制提升种群多样性；通过吸引域分析、统计检验、可视化和t-SNE嵌入验证生成函数的特性并评估其与BBOB实例空间的关系。

Result: 生成的函数确实表现出预期的结构特征，且t-SNE嵌入显示它们扩展了BBOB实例空间而非形成无关簇，提供了广泛、可解释且可复现的景观分析基准问题集。

Conclusion: LLaMEA框架成功生成了具有可控景观特性的多样化基准问题，为景观分析和自动算法选择提供了宝贵资源，有效弥补了现有测试套件的多样性不足。

Abstract: Benchmarking in continuous black-box optimisation is hindered by the limited structural diversity of existing test suites such as BBOB. We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits. In addition, a t-SNE embedding shows that they expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster. The resulting library provides a broad, interpretable, and reproducible set of benchmark problems for landscape analysis and downstream tasks such as automated algorithm selection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种区间二型自适应神经模糊推理系统（IT2-ANFIS），用于污水处理厂能耗预测，通过模糊规则结构生成可解释的预测区间，从特征级、规则级和实例级三个层面分解不确定性，在提供可比预测性能的同时实现风险感知决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 污水处理厂消耗全球1-3%的电力，准确的能耗预测对运营优化和可持续发展至关重要。然而现有机器学习模型仅提供点预测，缺乏可解释的不确定性量化，难以满足关键基础设施风险感知决策的需求。

Method: 提出区间二型自适应神经模糊推理系统（IT2-ANFIS），利用模糊规则结构生成可解释的预测区间。该方法从三个层面分解不确定性：特征级识别引入模糊性的变量，规则级分析局部模型的置信度，实例级量化整体预测不确定性。

Result: 在墨尔本水业东部处理厂数据集上的验证表明，IT2-ANFIS与一阶ANFIS具有相当的预测性能，但训练运行方差显著降低，同时能提供可解释的不确定性估计，将预测置信度与运行条件和输入变量直接关联。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多层面不确定性分解，为安全关键基础设施提供了可解释的不确定性量化工具，支持风险感知决策，在保持预测准确性的同时增强模型的可信度和透明度。

Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants consume 1-3% of global electricity, making accurate energy forecasting critical for operational optimization and sustainability. While machine learning models provide point predictions, they lack explainable uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision-making in safety-critical infrastructure. This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures. Unlike black-box probabilistic methods, the proposed framework decomposes uncertainty across three levels: feature-level, footprint of uncertainty identify which variables introduce ambiguity, rule-level analysis reveals confidence in local models, and instance-level intervals quantify overall prediction uncertainty. Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UA-3DTalk: An uncertainty-aware 3D emotional talking face synthesis method using emotion prior distillation to improve audio-vision alignment and adaptive multi-view fusion, outperforming state-of-the-art by 5.2% in emotion alignment and 3.1% in lip sync quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D emotional talking face synthesis suffers from poor audio-vision emotion alignment (difficult emotion extraction, inadequate micro-expression control) and non-adaptive multi-view fusion that ignores uncertainty and feature quality differences, harming rendering quality.

Method: Proposed UA-3DTalk with three core modules: (1) Prior Extraction disentangles audio into content-synchronized and person-specific features; (2) Emotion Distillation uses multi-modal attention-weighted fusion and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution codebooks for fine-grained emotion extraction and micro-expression control; (3) Uncertainty-based Deformation estimates view-specific aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty for adaptive multi-view fusion and Gaussian primitive optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show UA-3DTalk outperforms DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID (emotion alignment), 3.1% in SyncC (lip synchronization), and 0.015 in LPIPS (rendering quality).

Conclusion: UA-3DTalk effectively addresses the challenges of 3D emotional talking face synthesis through uncertainty-aware adaptive fusion and emotion prior distillation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across emotion alignment, lip sync, and rendering quality metrics.

Abstract: Emotional Talking Face synthesis is pivotal in multimedia and signal processing, yet existing 3D methods suffer from two critical challenges: poor audio-vision emotion alignment, manifested as difficult audio emotion extraction and inadequate control over emotional micro-expressions; and a one-size-fits-all multi-view fusion strategy that overlooks uncertainty and feature quality differences, undermining rendering quality. We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

Conclusion: 该对抗RL方法为构建更健壮的函数调用大模型提供了系统化途径，通过持续挑战模型弱点来提升其工具交互能力。

Abstract: Function call capabilities have become crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to interact more effectively with external tools and APIs. Existing methods for improving the function call capabilities of LLMs rely on data obtained either through manual annotation or automated generation by models, and use this data to finetune the LLMs. However, these methods often lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns and data distributions, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing the generalization and robustness of function call LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method that employs reinforcement learning to systematically identify and target the weaknesses of function call LLMs. Our training framework introduces a query model trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adversarial queries that are specifically designed to challenge function call (FC) models. This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools.

Method: 提出LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network)，包含三个轻量组件：频谱长度编码器将长度映射为连续表示，长度条件提示向长短行为分支注入全局上下文，长度调制注意力根据序列长度自适应调整注意力锐度

Result: 在三个真实世界基准数据集和五个强CTR基线模型上，LAIN持续提升整体性能，AUC最高提升1.15%，log loss降低2.25%，显著改善短序列用户精度且不牺牲长序列效果

Conclusion: LAIN提供了一个通用、高效且可部署的解决方案，有效缓解了序列推荐中的长度诱导偏差问题

Abstract: User behavior sequences in modern recommendation systems exhibit significant length heterogeneity, ranging from sparse short-term interactions to rich long-term histories. While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction. Notably, our method significantly improves accuracy for short-sequence users without sacrificing longsequence effectiveness. Our work offers a general, efficient, and deployable solution to mitigate length-induced bias in sequential recommendation.

Conclusion: 该架构有效保持模态保真度、暴露矛盾证据、缓解数值幻觉，且无需任务特定微调，证明了模态专业化协作的价值

Abstract: Recent progress at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and time series (TS) analysis has revealed both promise and fragility. While LLMs can reason over temporal structure given carefully engineered context, they often struggle with numeric fidelity, modality interference, and principled cross-modal integration. We present TS-Debate, a modality-specialized, collaborative multi-agent debate framework for zero-shot time series reasoning. TS-Debate assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, preceded by explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates their interaction via a structured debate protocol. Reviewer agents evaluate agent claims using a verification-conflict-calibration mechanism, supported by lightweight code execution and numerical lookup for programmatic verification. This architecture preserves modality fidelity, exposes conflicting evidence, and mitigates numeric hallucinations without task-specific fine-tuning. Across 20 tasks spanning three public benchmarks, TS-Debate achieves consistent and significant performance improvements over strong baselines, including standard multimodal debate in which all agents observe all inputs.

Abstract: Automatically extracting workflows as procedural graphs from natural language is promising yet underexplored, demanding both structural validity and logical alignment. While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text. Important feedback is prioritized and expressed in natural language, which is injected into subsequent prompts, enabling interpretable and controllable refinement. This modular design allows agents to target distinct error types without supervision or parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate that \model{} achieves substantial improvements in both structural correctness and logical consistency over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 针对长序列推荐系统中KV缓存存储开销大的问题，本文发现不同用户的KV序列存在显著相似性，据此提出CollectiveKV跨用户KV共享机制，通过可学习的全局KV池实现信息复用，在5个模型和3个数据集上验证可将KV缓存压缩至原大小的0.8%且保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流序列推荐模型采用Transformer注意力机制，但计算复杂度随序列长度增长导致延迟问题。KV缓存虽能降低推理延迟，但在用户基数大、历史序列长的场景下带来巨大存储开销。现有方法未能有效利用用户间KV的相似性来压缩存储。

Method: 提出CollectiveKV跨用户KV共享机制。首先通过SVD分析发现KV信息可分为用户共享的大部分信息和用户特有的小部分信息。构建可学习的全局KV池捕获跨用户共享信息，推理时每个用户从池中检索高维共享KV，与低维用户特定KV拼接得到最终KV。

Result: 在5个序列推荐模型和3个数据集上的实验表明，该方法可将KV缓存压缩至原始大小的0.8%，同时保持甚至提升模型性能。

Conclusion: CollectiveKV通过跨用户KV共享有效解决了推荐系统中KV缓存的存储开销问题，为长序列推荐提供了高效的推理加速方案。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that generates interpretable and verifiable annotations for multimodal table understanding, leading to significant performance improvements over existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal table understanding datasets like MMTab lack multi-step reasoning supervision, resulting in models that produce brief, inaccurate responses with limited interpretability.

Method: The authors propose CoReTab, a framework that couples multi-step reasoning with executable Python code to produce scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations. They curate a dataset of 115K verified samples, fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline, and evaluate on 17 MMTab benchmarks.

Result: The CoReTab-trained model achieves gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6% on table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding respectively, while generating transparent and verifiable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: CoReTab is established as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.

Abstract: Existing datasets for multimodal table understanding, such as MMTab, primarily provide short factual answers without explicit multi-step reasoning supervision. Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.

TL;DR: 本文提出 MAGNET，一种基于双层次记忆的自适应移动 GUI 智能体框架，通过利用界面变化中保持稳定的功能语义和任务意图，解决应用更新导致智能体失效的问题，在 AndroidWorld 基准测试中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动 GUI 智能体在执行任务时，应用频繁更新导致 UI 外观和流程变化，使得基于历史数据训练的智能体失效。尽管界面变化，但功能语义和任务意图保持稳定，这为解决问题提供了关键洞察。

Method: 提出 MAGNET 框架，包含：1）静态记忆：将多样视觉特征映射到稳定功能语义，实现鲁棒动作 grounding；2）过程记忆：捕捉跨不同流程的稳定任务意图；3）动态记忆进化机制：通过优先高频访问知识持续优化记忆。

Result: 在 AndroidWorld 在线基准测试中相比基线方法获得显著提升，离线基准测试在分布偏移下也表现一致增益。

Conclusion: 利用界面变化中的稳定结构（功能语义和任务意图）能够有效提升智能体在动态软件环境中的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents powered by large foundation models enable autonomous task execution, but frequent updates altering UI appearance and reorganizing workflows cause agents trained on historical data to fail. Despite surface changes, functional semantics and task intents remain fundamentally stable. Building on this insight, we introduce MAGNET, a memory-driven adaptive agent framework with dual-level memory: stationary memory linking diverse visual features to stable functional semantics for robust action grounding and procedural memory capturing stable task intents across varying workflows. We propose a dynamic memory evolution mechanism that continuously refines both memories by prioritizing frequently accessed knowledge. Online benchmark AndroidWorld evaluations show substantial improvements over baselines, while offline benchmarks confirm consistent gains under distribution shifts. These results validate that leveraging stable structures across interface changes improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.

### [73] [MATA: A Trainable Hierarchical Automaton System for Multi-Agent Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19204)
*Zhixi Cai,Fucai Ke,Kevin Leo,Sukai Huang,Maria Garcia de la Banda,Peter J. Stuckey,Hamid Rezatofighi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes MATA, a multi-agent hierarchical automaton system that uses a trainable hyper agent to dynamically coordinate specialized agents for visual reasoning, achieving SOTA performance while improving interpretability through shared memory and rule-based sub-automata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models suffer from unexplainable reasoning and hallucinations on complex queries. Existing compositional methods lack dynamic decision-making for agent collaboration/competition and rely on rigid hand-crafted pipelines.

Method: MATA frames visual reasoning as a hierarchical finite-state automaton: a trainable hyper agent selects top-level transitions; each agent runs rule-based sub-automata; all agents share memory for transparency. They built MATA-SFT-90K dataset from transition-trajectory trees for supervised finetuning of the hyper agent's policy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks compared to both monolithic and compositional baselines, with transparent execution history and efficient agent selection.

Conclusion: MATA successfully combines multi-agent systems with trainable automation for interpretable and high-performing visual reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of dynamic agent coordination through learned transition policies.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models have strong perceptual ability but their implicit reasoning is hard to explain and easily generates hallucinations on complex queries. Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task. Across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, MATA achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with monolithic and compositional baselines. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ControlNet/MATA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出SpikeScore，一种通过量化多轮对话中不确定性突增波动来检测大语言模型幻觉的新方法，在跨领域泛化性上显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法在训练和测试数据同域时表现良好，但跨领域泛化能力差，而实际部署需要模型在多样化场景中保持稳健性能。

Method: 通过模拟多轮对话发现幻觉引发的对话在不同领域均表现出更大的不确定性波动，基于此提出量化突增波动的SpikeScore指标，并结合理论分析与实证验证。

Result: 在多个大语言模型和基准测试上的实验表明，基于SpikeScore的检测方法在跨领域泛化性上超越代表性基线及先进的泛化导向方法。

Conclusion: SpikeScore在幻觉与非幻觉响应间表现出强跨领域可分性，为部署大语言模型的幻觉检测提供了有效的跨领域解决方案。

Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GLOVE框架，通过主动探测记忆与观察间的不一致性，在无监督条件下实现记忆-环境对齐，显著提升动态环境中LLM智能体的鲁棒性和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆增强LLM方法依赖外部评估器或模型自省来验证记忆有效性，但在动态漂移的实际环境中这些假设往往失效，导致智能体性能下降。

Method: 提出Global Verifier (GLOVE)框架，引入"相对真理"概念，通过主动探测检测检索记忆与新鲜观察之间的不一致性，无需真实监督或依赖模型自省即可实现记忆更新与环境对齐。

Result: 在网页导航、规划和控制等基准测试上，加入受控环境漂移后，GLOVE显著提高了智能体的成功率。

Conclusion: GLOVE为构建能够在动态环境中自我演化的认知智能体提供了稳健路径，展示了强大的适应性优势。

Abstract: Most existing memory-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) approaches implicitly assume that memory validity can be established either through external evaluators that provide task-specific success signals or through internal model cognition, such as reflection, for editing memory entries. However, these assumptions often break down in practical environments with dynamic drifts. We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth. Through active probing to detect inconsistencies between retrieved memories and fresh observations, GLOVE enables memory-environment realignment by verifying and updating memory without access to ground-truth supervision or strong reliance on model introspection. We evaluate GLOVE on diverse benchmarks spanning web navigation, planning, and control, augmented with controlled environmental drifts that introduce non-stationarity beyond the original benchmark settings. Our results show that GLOVE substantially improves agent success rates, suggesting a robust pathway to cognitive agents capable of self-evolving.

TL;DR: A curiosity-driven framework that retrieves external knowledge into structured AppCards improves mobile agent performance by 6 points on AndroidWorld, achieving 88.8% SOTA with GPT-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile agents for smartphone automation suffer from incomplete knowledge and weak generalization in complex applications, limiting their reliability and performance.

Method: Introduces a curiosity-driven knowledge retrieval framework that formalizes execution uncertainty as a curiosity score. When exceeding a threshold, it retrieves external information from documentation, code repositories, and historical trajectories, organizing it into structured AppCards encoding functional semantics, parameters, interface mappings, and interaction patterns. An enhanced agent then integrates relevant AppCards during reasoning.

Result: Evaluation on AndroidWorld shows consistent 6-point average improvements across backbones, achieving a new state-of-the-art 88.8% success rate with GPT-5. AppCards are particularly effective for multi-step and cross-application tasks, reducing ambiguity, shortening exploration, and supporting stable execution.

Conclusion: The framework successfully compensates for knowledge blind spots and improves planning reliability, demonstrating significant performance gains for mobile agents in complex environments.

Abstract: Mobile agents have made progress toward reliable smartphone automation, yet performance in complex applications remains limited by incomplete knowledge and weak generalization to unseen environments. We introduce a curiosity driven knowledge retrieval framework that formalizes uncertainty during execution as a curiosity score. When this score exceeds a threshold, the system retrieves external information from documentation, code repositories, and historical trajectories. Retrieved content is organized into structured AppCards, which encode functional semantics, parameter conventions, interface mappings, and interaction patterns. During execution, an enhanced agent selectively integrates relevant AppCards into its reasoning process, thereby compensating for knowledge blind spots and improving planning reliability. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark shows consistent improvements across backbones, with an average gain of six percentage points and a new state of the art success rate of 88.8\% when combined with GPT-5. Analysis indicates that AppCards are particularly effective for multi step and cross application tasks, while improvements depend on the backbone model. Case studies further confirm that AppCards reduce ambiguity, shorten exploration, and support stable execution trajectories. Task trajectories are publicly available at https://lisalsj.github.io/Droidrun-appcard/.

Motivation: 大语言模型的强化微调算法在训练回滚阶段需要生成完整的推理轨迹，导致巨大的计算开销。

Method: 提出RPO算法，通过生成推理路径的后缀并利用经验缓存，减少令牌生成。

Result: 在回滚阶段减少约95%的令牌生成，1.5B模型训练时间减少90%，7B模型减少72%，并能与GRPO、DAPO等算法集成。

Conclusion: RPO是一个即插即用的强化微调算法，能有效加速训练同时保持性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Within the domain of large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms necessitate the generation of a complete reasoning trajectory beginning from the input query, which incurs significant computational overhead during the rollout phase of training. To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

Abstract: Purifying sour water is essential for reducing emissions, minimizing corrosion risks, enabling the reuse of treated water in industrial or domestic applications, and ultimately lowering operational costs. Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose.

Motivation: 当前LLM基准受数据集和评测方法不准确性的影响，亟需改进。

Method: 人工审计Omni-MATH创建干净精确答案子集(4181题)和标记非标准子集(247题)，对比GPT-5 mini与Omni-Judge评估评判器可靠性。

Result: 数据集噪声显著降低，Omni-Judge在96.4%分歧中错误，两评判器均无法识别标记问题失败模式，错误随难度增加。

Conclusion: 准确LLM基准需要高质量数据集和可靠评判器，难题评测中评判器错误会掩盖真实模型差异。

Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.

Abstract: Heuristic functions are essential to the performance of tree search algorithms such as A*, where their accuracy and efficiency directly impact search outcomes. Traditionally, such heuristics are handcrafted, requiring significant expertise. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary frameworks have opened the door to automating heuristic design. In this paper, we extend the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework to investigate the automated generation of guiding heuristics for A* search. We introduce a novel domain-agnostic prompt augmentation strategy that includes the A* code into the prompt to leverage in-context learning, named Algorithmic - Contextual EoH (A-CEoH). To evaluate the effectiveness of A-CeoH, we study two problem domains: the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem (UPMP), a niche problem from warehouse logistics, and the classical sliding puzzle problem (SPP). Our computational experiments show that A-CEoH can significantly improve the quality of the generated heuristics and even outperform expert-designed heuristics.

Abstract: With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.

Motivation: Graph-based Multi-Agent Systems suffer from inefficient static model allocation where uniformly deploying strong models wastes computation on trivial sub-tasks.

Method: Employs a Dual-Signal Router combining semantic embeddings with structural meta-features to estimate task difficulty, trained via Cold Start to Iterative Evolution paradigm that learns from routing failures using on-policy negative feedback.

Conclusion: CASTER enables efficient dynamic model allocation in MAS, achieving substantial computational savings without compromising task performance.

Abstract: Graph-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable complex cyclic workflows but suffer from inefficient static model allocation, where deploying strong models uniformly wastes computation on trivial sub-tasks. We propose CASTER (Context-Aware Strategy for Task Efficient Routing), a lightweight router for dynamic model selection in graph-based MAS. CASTER employs a Dual-Signal Router that combines semantic embeddings with structural meta-features to estimate task difficulty. During training, the router self-optimizes through a Cold Start to Iterative Evolution paradigm, learning from its own routing failures via on-policy negative feedback. Experiments using LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation across Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Scientific Discovery, and Cybersecurity demonstrate that CASTER reduces inference cost by up to 72.4% compared to strong-model baselines while matching their success rates, and consistently outperforms both heuristic routing and FrugalGPT across all domains.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a healthcare recommender system that uses psychometric data structure to generate interpretable visual explanations for care professionals in gerontological primary care, addressing challenges like data scarcity, recommendation transparency, and risk concerns, with promising results from offline tests and user studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare recommender systems face challenges including lack of public clinical data, difficulty in explaining recommendations, risks in following recommendations, and uncertainty about effectiveness, limiting their practical utility in clinical settings.

Method: Developed a recommendation model that leverages psychometric data structure to provide visual explanations faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals, focusing on gerontological primary care for personalized care plan creation.

Result: Offline performance evaluation on Brazilian healthcare datasets and a user study on explanation interpretability showed positive results, indicating the model's effectiveness and interpretability in this healthcare niche.

Conclusion: The proposed model can advance recommender system applications in gerontological primary care, a growing field with increasing demand and IT needs due to demographic changes.

Abstract: There are challenges that must be overcome to make recommender systems useful in healthcare settings. The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates. The results suggest that the proposed model can advance the application of recommender systems in this healthcare niche, which is expected to grow in demand , opportunities, and information technology needs as demographic changes become more pronounced.

By explicitly modelling schema coverage, structural connectivity, and fine-grained semantic alignment, the proposed modular, reasoning-driven reranking strategy consistently outperforms embedding-only and direct LLM-prompting baselines across all the metrics.

### [86] [Visual Generation Unlocks Human-Like Reasoning through Multimodal World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19834)
*Jialong Wu,Xiaoying Zhang,Hongyi Yuan,Xiangcheng Zhang,Tianhao Huang,Changjing He,Chaoyi Deng,Renrui Zhang,Youbin Wu,Mingsheng Long*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates when visual generation benefits AI reasoning by proposing a "visual superiority hypothesis": for physical world tasks, visual world models outperform purely verbal ones. Through theoretical formalization and experiments with a new evaluation suite (VisWorld-Eval), they demonstrate that interleaved visual-verbal chain-of-thought reasoning significantly beats purely verbal reasoning on spatial/physical tasks, but offers no advantage for abstract domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While chain-of-thought reasoning achieves expert-level performance in abstract domains like mathematics and programming through verbal reasoning, AI still lags behind humans in physical and spatial intelligence that require richer representations. Unified multimodal models (UMMs) can generate both text and images, but it remains unclear when and how visual generation actually benefits reasoning capabilities.

Method: The paper combines theoretical and empirical approaches: (1) Theoretically formalizes internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyzes distinctions among different world model forms; (2) Empirically identifies tasks requiring interleaved visual-verbal CoT, constructs a new evaluation suite VisWorld-Eval, and runs controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM comparing interleaved CoT against purely verbal CoT.

Result: Interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling (particularly those grounded in the physical world), but provides no clear advantage for tasks where verbal world models are sufficient.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like AI, supporting the visual superiority hypothesis that visual generation serves as more natural world models for physical tasks, while highlighting that multimodal benefits are task-dependent rather than universally applicable.

Abstract: Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.

TL;DR: NavFormer uses rotation invariant scalar features and a Canonical SPD module to forecast the invariant IGRF total intensity target, overcoming triad magnetometer variations caused by sensor attitude changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Triad magnetometer readings vary with sensor attitude despite the invariant IGRF total intensity target, causing navigation inaccuracies.

Method: Proposes NavFormer with rotation invariant scalar features and a Canonical SPD module that stabilizes the spectrum of window-level second moments via Gram matrix-based canonical frame construction and state-dependent spectral scaling.

Result: Experiments across five flights demonstrate lower error than strong baselines in standard training, few-shot training, and zero-shot transfer scenarios.

Conclusion: NavFormer robustly forecasts IGRF total intensity, addressing sensor attitude-induced variations and enabling reliable autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Triad magnetometer components change with sensor attitude even when the IGRF total intensity target stays invariant. NavFormer forecasts this invariant target with rotation invariant scalar features and a Canonical SPD module that stabilizes the spectrum of window level second moments of the triads without sign discontinuities. The module builds a canonical frame from a Gram matrix per window and applies state dependent spectral scaling in the original coordinates. Experiments across five flights show lower error than strong baselines in standard training, few shot training, and zero shot transfer.

Method: 基于变分量子电路，实现DDPG和DQN的量子模拟版本，并在真实金融数据上进行实证评估。

Result: 量子智能体风险调整收益与经典模型相当或更优，参数效率高数个数量级，且跨市场波动性更低、更稳健；但云端量子系统的高延迟使实际运行受限于基础设施开销。

Conclusion: QRL在理论上与经典RL竞争力相当，随着部署开销降低可能具备实用优势，是复杂动态决策环境的有前景的范式。

Abstract: This paper presents a Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) solution to the dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on Variational Quantum Circuits. The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

### [89] [VAE with Hyperspherical Coordinates: Improving Anomaly Detection from Hypervolume-Compressed Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18823)
*Alejandro Ascarate,Leo Lebrat,Rodrigo Santa Cruz,Clinton Fookes,Olivier Salvado*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of detecting anomalies in high-dimensional VAE latent spaces where vectors cluster on hypersphere equators. The authors propose using hyperspherical coordinates to compress latent vectors toward a specific direction, creating a more expressive posterior that improves both unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection performance across real-world and benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional latent spaces in VAEs suffer from exponential hypervolume growth and latent vectors distributed on hypersphere equators, which severely limits the ability to detect out-of-distribution anomalies and affects generative capacity.

Method: Proposes reformulating VAE latent variables using hyperspherical coordinates to compress vectors toward a given direction on the hypersphere, enabling a more expressive approximate posterior.

Result: Achieves best performance on anomaly detection: (i) detecting unusual Mars Rover landscapes and galaxies (complex real-world data), and (ii) standard benchmarks like Cifar10 and ImageNet subsets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Hyperspherical coordinate formulation effectively addresses high-dimensional anomaly detection challenges and significantly improves both unsupervised and OOD detection capabilities of VAEs.

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods. For the unsupervised and OOD modalities, respectively, these are: i) detecting unusual landscape from the Mars Rover camera and unusual Galaxies from ground based imagery (complex, real world datasets); ii) standard benchmarks like Cifar10 and subsets of ImageNet as the in-distribution (ID) class.

TL;DR: IPBC是一种交互式投影聚类框架，通过人类引导的反馈循环优化非线性投影，使高维数据聚类更准确且可解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据集普遍存在但难以有效聚类，传统降维技术静态且无法利用分析师直觉，距离度量效用下降，簇在低维投影中易重叠或坍缩。

Method: 提出交互式基于投影的聚类框架IPBC，将聚类重构为迭代式人机引导的可视分析过程。集成非线性投影模块与反馈循环，允许用户调整视角并提供“必须链接”/“不能链接”约束，这些约束重塑投影目标，使相关点靠近、无关点远离。在优化后的2D布局上运行传统聚类算法，并通过可解释性组件将簇映射回原始特征空间，生成区分性规则或特征排序。

Result: 在多组基准数据集上的实验表明，仅需少量交互式精炼步骤即可显著提升聚类质量。

Conclusion: IPBC将聚类转变为机器表示与人类洞察相互增强的协作式发现过程。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets are increasingly common across scientific and industrial domains, yet they remain difficult to cluster effectively due to the diminishing usefulness of distance metrics and the tendency of clusters to collapse or overlap when projected into lower dimensions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.

### [91] [CP Loss: Channel-wise Perceptual Loss for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18829)
*Yaohua Zha,Chunlin Fan,Peiyuan Liu,Yong Jiang,Tao Dai,Hai Wu,Shu-Tao Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss) for multi-channel time-series forecasting, using learnable channel-specific filters to create adaptive perceptual spaces and compute task-oriented losses for better handling of channel heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-channel time-series data has heterogeneous channels with unique dynamics (fluctuations, trend shifts), but existing forecasting models use uniform, channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which fail to capture channel-specific characteristics and patterns.

Method: Designs a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes raw signals into disentangled multi-scale representations to form channel-specific perceptual spaces. The filter is jointly optimized with the forecasting model to ensure the perceptual space is task-oriented, and losses are computed within these adapted spaces.

Result: The abstract does not provide specific quantitative results or experimental outcomes.

Conclusion: The abstract does not provide explicit conclusions, but implies that CP Loss can better handle channel heterogeneity by adapting to individual channel characteristics through learned perceptual spaces.

Abstract: Multi-channel time-series data, prevalent across diverse applications, is characterized by significant heterogeneity in its different channels. However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task. Finally, losses are calculated within these perception spaces to optimize the model. Code is available at https://github.com/zyh16143998882/CP_Loss.

TL;DR: The Geometric Reasoner (TGR) 是一种无需训练框架，通过流形感知的潜在前瞻搜索和几何正则化，在长思维链推理中实现高达13点的AUC提升，且计算开销仅为1.1-1.3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时计算扩展方法在长思维链推理中面临计算成本与覆盖质量的基本权衡：要么训练开销高昂，要么产生冗余轨迹，限制了其效率和覆盖率。

Method: TGR在每个分块边界执行流形感知的潜在前瞻搜索，通过轻量级的前瞻估计结合软几何正则化器来评估候选潜在锚点，鼓励平滑轨迹和多样化探索，同时采用分块KV缓存重置保持内存与分块长度呈线性关系。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学和代码基准测试上，TGR在Qwen3-8B上稳健轨迹覆盖率（Pass@k曲线下面积AUC）提升高达13个点，计算开销仅为约1.1-1.3倍。

Conclusion: TGR提供了一种无需训练即可有效提升推理性能的方法，以极小的计算成本成功平衡了覆盖质量和效率。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute enhances long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between computational cost and coverage quality: either incurring high training expense or yielding redundant trajectories. We introduce The Geometric Reasoner (TGR), a training-free framework that performs manifold-informed latent foresight search under strict memory bounds. At each chunk boundary, TGR scores candidate latent anchors via a lightweight look-ahead estimate combined with soft geometric regularizers that encourage smooth trajectories and diverse exploration. Chunk-wise KV cache resets keep memory linear in chunk length. On challenging math and code benchmarks, TGR improves robust trajectory coverage, measured by the area under the Pass@$k$ curve (AUC), by up to 13 points on Qwen3-8B, with negligible overhead of about 1.1--1.3 times.

Motivation: 贝尔曼残差最小化具有函数逼近收敛更稳定的优势，但其在策略优化中的应用远少于动态规划，存在研究空白。

Method: 通过理论分析建立控制贝尔曼残差最小化的基础框架，直接最小化平方贝尔曼残差目标函数。

Result: 建立了控制贝尔曼残差最小化的基础理论结果，为策略优化问题提供了新的理论方法。

Conclusion: 验证了贝尔曼残差方法在控制任务中的可行性，为未来模型无关强化学习扩展奠定基础。

Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored. In this paper, we establish foundational results for the control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.

### [94] [Representational Homomorphism Predicts and Improves Compositional Generalization In Transformer Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18858)
*Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Homomorphism Error (HE), a structural metric that measures how well neural networks' hidden states preserve compositional structure. HE predicts OOD generalization failures and can be used as a training signal to improve compositional generalization in Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks struggle with compositional generalization (understanding novel combinations of known components). Current behavioral evaluations only reveal when models fail without explaining why at the representational level, limiting diagnostic capabilities and targeted interventions.

Method: The authors propose Homomorphism Error (HE) to quantify deviations from approximate homomorphisms between expression algebra and hidden-state spaces. They instantiate HE for two compositional operators (modifier/unary and sequence/binary composition) in SCAN-style tasks using small decoder-only Transformers, measuring how well representation-level operators can predict composed representations from their parts.

Result: HE strongly correlates with OOD accuracy (R² = 0.73 for modifier HE). Model depth minimally affects HE or OOD performance, while training data coverage shows threshold effects. Noise tokens systematically increase HE. HE-regularized training significantly reduces both modifier HE (p = 1.1×10⁻⁴) and sequence HE (p = 0.001), yielding improved OOD accuracy (p = 0.023).

Conclusion: HE serves as both an effective diagnostic tool for compositional generalization failures and an actionable training signal. The metric reveals structural limitations in neural networks' representations and provides a mechanism for improving OOD generalization through regularization.

Abstract: Compositional generalization-the ability to interpret novel combinations of familiar components-remains a persistent challenge for neural networks. Behavioral evaluations reveal when models fail but offer limited insight into why failures arise at the representational level. We introduce Homomorphism Error (HE), a structural metric that quantifies deviations from approximate homomorphisms between the expression algebra and a model's hidden-state space. We instantiate HE for two compositional operators in SCAN-style tasks: modifier HE for unary composition and sequence HE for binary composition, measured by learning representation-level operators that predict composed representations from their parts. Across controlled experiments with small decoder-only Transformers, HE predicts out-of-distribution (OOD) compositional generalization under noise injection, achieving R^2 = 0.73 correlation between modifier HE and OOD accuracy. Ablations show that model depth has minimal effect on either HE or OOD accuracy, training data coverage exhibits threshold effects (insufficient coverage sharply increases HE and degrades OOD performance), and randomly inserted noise tokens systematically increase HE. Finally, we test if HE-regularized training improves OOD accuracy. Experiment shows that explicitly enforcing low modifier HE during training significantly reduces modifier HE (p = 1.1x10-4) and sequence HE (p = 0.001) and yields a statistically significant improvement in OOD accuracy (p = 0.023). Together, these results indicate the potential of HE to be both a diagnostic and an actionable training signal for improving compositional generalization. Code to reproduce our experiments is open-sourced.

### [95] [How Is Uncertainty Propagated in Knowledge Distillation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18909)
*Ziyao Cui,Jian Pei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies uncertainty propagation in knowledge distillation across linear models, neural networks, and LLMs, showing that standard distillation suppresses intra-student variance while preserving inter-student variability. It proposes two variance-aware corrections—teacher response averaging and inverse-variance weighting—that produce more stable students with better uncertainty reflection and reduced hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard knowledge distillation treats the process as deterministic, collapsing stochastic uncertainties to single point estimates, which can distort what is learned. The inherent randomness in teacher outputs, student training, and inference is overlooked, potentially leading to unstable student models that don't properly reflect teacher uncertainty.

Method: The authors systematically analyze uncertainty propagation across three model classes (linear regression, feed-forward networks, LLMs). They distinguish inter-student vs. intra-student uncertainty and propose two variance-aware strategies: (1) averaging multiple teacher responses to reduce noise at O(1/k) rate, and (2) variance-weighting using inverse-variance weighting to create minimum-variance estimators.

Result: They provide formal guarantees for linear regression, validate methods in neural networks, and show empirical gains in LLM distillation including reduced systematic noise and hallucination. Standard distillation suppresses intra-student variance but leaves substantial inter-student variability.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation should be reframed as an uncertainty transformation process. Variance-aware distillation produces more stable student models that better reflect teacher uncertainty, addressing limitations of single-response distillation.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation transfers behavior from a teacher to a student model, but the process is inherently stochastic: teacher outputs, student training, and student inference can all be random. Collapsing these uncertainties to a single point estimate can distort what is learned. We systematically study how uncertainty propagates through knowledge distillation across three representative model classes--linear regression, feed-forward neural networks, and large language models (LLMs)--and propose simple corrections. We distinguish inter-student uncertainty (variance across independently distilled students) from intra-student uncertainty (variance of a single student's predictive distribution), showing that standard single-response knowledge distillation suppresses intra-student variance while leaving substantial inter-student variability. To address these mismatches, we introduce two variance-aware strategies: averaging multiple teacher responses, which reduces noise at rate $O(1/k)$, and variance-weighting, which combines teacher and student estimates via inverse-variance weighting to yield a minimum-variance estimator. We provide formal guarantees in linear regression, validate the methods in neural networks, and demonstrate empirical gains in LLM distillation, including reduced systematic noise and hallucination. These results reframe knowledge distillation as an uncertainty transformation and show that variance-aware distillation produces more stable students that better reflect teacher uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准GNN在低同配性图上表现不佳，但同配性本身无法解释性能差异。标签信息量（相邻节点标签的互信息）能更准确地刻画图结构何时对节点分类有用。

Method: 开发通过标签信息量连接曲率引导重连和位置几何的统一理论框架，实例化为使用Forman曲率和拉普拉斯位置编码的ASEHybrid。分析调整同配性、拉普拉斯平滑、Forman曲率表达能力及重连过程的收敛性和Lipschitz稳定性。

Result: 理论上刻画几何感知GNN优于纯特征基线的充要条件：图结构必须携带超越节点特征的标签相关信息。证明Forman曲率重塑信息流但不增强超越1-WL测试的表达能力。在Chameleon、Squirrel、Texas、Tolokers和Minesweeper上的实验表明，仅在标签信息丰富的异质图上取得增益，在高基线 regime 无显著改进。

Conclusion: 标签信息量比同配性更能准确刻画图结构的作用。ASEHybrid架构和理论框架为结构提供互补信息的异质图提供了原则性理解和实际改进。

Abstract: Standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle on graphs with low homophily, yet homophily alone does not explain this behavior, as graphs with similar homophily levels can exhibit markedly different performance and some heterophilous graphs remain easy for vanilla GCNs. Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.

*Bartosz Szabłowski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline combining a global CatBoost forecasting model with stockout-aware features and a lightweight cost-aware ordering policy won the VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge by effectively balancing shortage and holding costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge, which formalizes real-world retail inventory planning with asymmetric shortage/holding costs and two-week delivery lead times, requiring translation of demand forecasts into optimal weekly ordering decisions.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: (1) Global multi-horizon forecasting using CatBoost with stockout-aware feature engineering, per-series scaling, and time-based observation weights to handle censored demand; (2) Cost-aware ordering policy that projects inventory to delivery week start and calculates target stock levels explicitly trading off shortage and holding costs.

Result: Achieved first place in the official competition simulation across six evaluation rounds.

Conclusion: The combination of a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy is highly effective for inventory planning. The approach can be extended to real-world applications and accommodate additional operational constraints.

Abstract: Inventory planning for retail chains requires translating demand forecasts into ordering decisions, including asymmetric shortages and holding costs. The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns. In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs. Evaluated by the official competition simulation in six rounds, the solution achieved first place by combining a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy. Although developed for the VN2 setting, the proposed approach can be extended to real-world applications and additional operational constraints.

*Seiji Shaw,Travis Manderson,Chad Kessens,Nicholas Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method combines Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and tensor decomposition to learn POMDP transition/observation models with hidden states, enabling explicit planning after model learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents need to learn hidden-state systems (e.g., furniture with secret locks) by estimating POMDP parameters from action-observation sequences, but existing spectral/PSR methods fail to directly yield transition/observation likelihoods required for planning.

Method: Integrates PSRs with tensor decomposition to estimate transition/observation matrices up to state partitions (where states in a partition share observation distributions), relaxing assumptions of full state observability and full-rank transition matrices in prior tensor methods.

Result: Partition-level transition models match PSR performance in sampling-based POMDP solvers with sufficient data, while additionally providing explicit observation/transition likelihoods usable for downstream planning.

Conclusion: This approach bridges the gap between representation learning and practical planning by delivering both accurate predictive models (like PSRs) and explicit dynamics for controller specification, advancing autonomous learning in partially observable domains.

Abstract: We are interested in enabling autonomous agents to learn and reason about systems with hidden states, such as furniture with hidden locking mechanisms. We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高缺失率下图节点特征插补具有挑战性。现有基于潜在表示或全局扩散的方法往往产生不可靠估计，并可能在图中传播错误。

Method: FSD-CAP框架包含两个阶段：第一阶段使用图距离引导的子图扩展来局部化扩散过程，分数扩散算子根据局部结构调整传播锐度；第二阶段使用类感知传播，结合伪标签和邻域熵来优化插补特征并促进一致性。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，当99.5%的特征缺失时，FSD-CAP在节点分类上的平均准确率为80.06%（结构）和81.01%（均匀），接近具有完整特征的GCN的81.31%。在相同设置下的链路预测中，AUC得分达到91.65%（结构）和92.41%（均匀），而完全观察情况下为95.06%。此外，FSD-CAP在大规模和异配性数据集上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: FSD-CAP框架在极端稀疏条件下显著提高了插补质量，性能接近完整特征基线，并在各种数据集上优于其他模型。

Abstract: Imputing missing node features in graphs is challenging, particularly under high missing rates. Existing methods based on latent representations or global diffusion often fail to produce reliable estimates, and may propagate errors across the graph. We propose FSD-CAP, a two-stage framework designed to improve imputation quality under extreme sparsity. In the first stage, a graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion localizes the diffusion process. A fractional diffusion operator adjusts propagation sharpness based on local structure. In the second stage, imputed features are refined using class-aware propagation, which incorporates pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy to promote consistency. We evaluated FSD-CAP on multiple datasets. With $99.5\%$ of features missing across five benchmark datasets, FSD-CAP achieves average accuracies of $80.06\%$ (structural) and $81.01\%$ (uniform) in node classification, close to the $81.31\%$ achieved by a standard GCN with full features. For link prediction under the same setting, it reaches AUC scores of $91.65\%$ (structural) and $92.41\%$ (uniform), compared to $95.06\%$ for the fully observed case. Furthermore, FSD-CAP demonstrates superior performance on both large-scale and heterophily datasets when compared to other models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method using sparse autoencoders to identify and fine-tune only 3% of neurons responsible for sycophantic behavior in LLMs, matching SOTA with less data and fewer side effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current behavioral alignment methods use broad fine-tuning which causes distributional shift and low interpretability; seeking a more targeted, data-efficient approach.

Method: Uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and linear probes to identify the 3% of MLP neurons most predictive of target behavior, then fine-tunes only those neurons using gradient masking.

Result: Matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks (Syco-Bench, NLP, POLI, PHIL) for reducing sycophantic behavior using Gemma-2-2B and 9B models, while requiring less data.

Conclusion: Sparse, neuron-level updates provide a scalable and precise alternative to full-model fine-tuning, remaining effective even with limited data availability.

Abstract: Behavioral alignment in large language models (LLMs) is often achieved through broad fine-tuning, which can result in undesired side effects like distributional shift and low interpretability. We propose a method for alignment that identifies and updates only the neurons most responsible for a given behavior, a targeted approach that allows for fine-tuning with significantly less data. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and linear probes, we isolate the 3% of MLP neurons most predictive of a target behavior, decode them into residual space, and fine-tune only those neurons using gradient masking. We demonstrate this approach on the task of reducing sycophantic behavior, where our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks (Syco-Bench, NLP, POLI, PHIL) using Gemma-2-2B and 9B models. Our results show that sparse, neuron-level updates offer a scalable and precise alternative to full-model fine-tuning, remaining effective even in situations when little data is available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KE-DRL framework uses kernel mean embeddings in Hilbert space to efficiently estimate multi-dimensional value distributions in offline RL, replacing costly Wasserstein metrics with integral probability metrics, with proven theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional distributional reinforcement learning faces computational challenges when computing Wasserstein distances in multi-dimensional continuous state-action spaces, limiting its application in complex real-world decision-making and risk evaluation scenarios.

Method: Proposes KE-DRL: an offline multi-dimensional distributional RL framework that maps probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, replacing Wasserstein metrics with integral probability metrics using Matern kernels.

Result: Theoretically establishes contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator and uniform convergence guarantees; empirically demonstrates robust off-policy evaluation and accurate kernel mean embedding recovery under mild Lipschitz continuity and boundedness assumptions.

Conclusion: The framework shows significant potential for complex real-world decision-making and risk evaluation, offering computational efficiency and theoretical soundness for multi-dimensional continuous reinforcement learning problems.

Abstract: We propose an (offline) multi-dimensional distributional reinforcement learning framework (KE-DRL) that leverages Hilbert space mappings to estimate the kernel mean embedding of the multi-dimensional value distribution under a proposed target policy. In our setting, the state-action variables are multi-dimensional and continuous. By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, our method replaces Wasserstein metrics with an integral probability metric. This enables efficient estimation in multi-dimensional state-action spaces and reward settings, where direct computation of Wasserstein distances is computationally challenging. Theoretically, we establish contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator under our proposed metric involving the Matern family of kernels and provide uniform convergence guarantees. Simulations and empirical results demonstrate robust off-policy evaluation and recovery of the kernel mean embedding under mild assumptions, namely, Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the kernels, highlighting the potential of embedding-based approaches in complex real-world decision-making scenarios and risk evaluation.

*Utkarsh Pratiush,Austin Houston,Richard Liu,Gerd Duscher,Sergei Kalinin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多目标贝叶斯优化（MOBO）框架，用于实现扫描透射电子显微镜（STEM）的快速、数据高效像差校正。该方法通过高斯过程回归和帕累托前沿处理用户定义的物理目标，展现出比传统方法更强的鲁棒性和优化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现高通量像差校正STEM原子结构探索需要快速调节多极探头校正器并补偿光柱漂移。现有自动化校准方法存在局限：传统无梯度搜索（如Nelder-Mead）样本效率低且难以同时优化多个交互参数；新兴深度学习方法虽快但缺乏适应不同样品条件的灵活性，需要大量重新训练。

Method: 引入MOBO框架，采用高斯过程回归对像差空间进行概率建模，主动选择信息量最大的透镜参数进行迭代评估，支持用户定义的物理驱动奖励函数（如对称性目标），并通过帕累托前沿揭示竞争实验目标间的权衡关系。

Result: 实验证明，该主动学习循环比传统优化算法更具鲁棒性，能有效调节聚焦、像散及高阶像差，实现实验过程中的动态性能维持。

Conclusion: 此方法通过平衡竞争目标，实现了"自优化"显微镜技术，为STEM高通量原子结构探索提供了灵活且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Realizing high-throughput aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) exploration of atomic structures requires rapid tuning of multipole probe correctors while compensating for the inevitable drift of the optical column. While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. By balancing competing objectives, this approach enables "self-optimizing" microscopy by dynamically sustaining optimal performance during experiments.

TL;DR: 针对量子硬件的器件异质性和环境漂移问题，本文推导出元学习的标度律下界，证明适应增益随梯度步数指数饱和且与任务方差线性相关，为自适应控制提供量化决策标准。在量子门校准中，高方差任务可实现>40%保真度提升，经典控制验证表明该框架具有普适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子硬件存在固有器件异质性和环境漂移问题，迫使从业者要么选择次优的非自适应控制器，要么承担昂贵的逐器件重新校准成本。需要量化评估自适应控制的收益是否值得其开销。

Method: 推导出元学习的标度律下界，分析适应增益（任务特定梯度步带来的预期保真度改进）与梯度步数和任务方差的关系，建立自适应控制开销与收益的量化判据。

Result: 量子门校准实验显示，低方差任务收益可忽略，但在极端分布外条件下（训练噪声的10倍）双量子比特门保真度提升>40%；经典线性二次控制验证证实该标度律源于通用优化几何而非量子物理特性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了可迁移的自适应控制决策框架，有助于减少云量子处理器上的逐器件校准时间，并为广义自适应控制系统设计提供理论指导。

Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.

### [104] [Save the Good Prefix: Precise Error Penalization via Process-Supervised RL to Enhance LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18984)
*Haolin Liu,Dian Yu,Sidi Lu,Yujun Zhou,Rui Liu,Zhenwen Liang,Haitao Mi,Chen-Yu Wei,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes VPPO, a method that uses process reward models (PRMs) to identify the first error in LLM reasoning trajectories, then rewards only the verified correct prefix while penalizing the erroneous suffix, leading to better credit assignment and improved performance over existing RL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLM reasoning rely on sparse outcome rewards that don't credit intermediate correct steps, while PRMs that provide fine-grained supervision are noisy and misaligned with their actual RL usage. The evaluation target of detecting first errors doesn't match how PRM scores are used as rewards in RL.

Method: Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO) uses PRMs to localize the first error in incorrect reasoning trajectories, partitions them into a verified correct prefix and erroneous suffix, and applies rewards to the prefix while penalizing only the suffix after the detected mistake.

Result: VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on multiple reasoning benchmarks, achieving better Pass@1 and Pass@K metrics.

Conclusion: By aligning PRM usage with RL objectives through targeted error localization and prefix-based reward assignment, VPPO provides stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment, leading to superior reasoning performance in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on both Pass@1 and Pass@K.

*Fangzhou Wu,Sandeep Silwal,Qiuyi,Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a unified model integrating KV cache eviction and query routing for multi-LLM serving, introducing randomized eviction and adaptive routing algorithms that significantly outperform LRU by balancing load and cache efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Default LRU eviction fails in dynamic multi-LLM serving where query load balancing and per-worker cache hit rate are conflicting objectives under memory constraints.

Method: Unified mathematical model revealing trade-offs; provably competitive randomized KV eviction + learning-based adaptive query routing for evolving patterns.

Result: Validated on 4 benchmarks: up to 6.92× higher cache hit rate, 11.96× lower latency, 14.06× reduced TTFT, and 77.4% higher throughput vs. state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Principled integration of eviction and routing algorithms effectively resolves core conflicts in KV cache management for scalable LLM serving.

Abstract: KV caching is a fundamental technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by reusing key-value (KV) pairs from previous queries, but its effectiveness under limited memory is highly sensitive to the eviction policy. The default Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction algorithm struggles with dynamic online query arrivals, especially in multi-LLM serving scenarios, where balancing query load across workers and maximizing cache hit rate of each worker are inherently conflicting objectives. We give the first unified mathematical model that captures the core trade-offs between KV cache eviction and query routing. Our analysis reveals the theoretical limitations of existing methods and leads to principled algorithms that integrate provably competitive randomized KV cache eviction with learning-based methods to adaptively route queries with evolving patterns, thus balancing query load and cache hit rate. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments across 4 benchmarks and 3 prefix-sharing settings, demonstrating improvements of up to 6.92$\times$ in cache hit rate, 11.96$\times$ reduction in latency, 14.06$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT), and 77.4% increase in throughput over the state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 高斯过程训练计算成本高（O(n³)），而平方指数协方差矩阵存在大量接近零的非对角线元素，这为稀疏化近似提供了可能。

Method: 设计一个原则性程序，剔除平方指数协方差矩阵中接近零的非对角线元素，构造带状矩阵近似，从而高效计算矩阵逆和行列式。

Result: 在1D平方指数核下，该方法能保持原始协方差结构，且计算效率优于稀疏高斯过程的变分自由能方法。

Conclusion: 该带状矩阵近似方法为高斯过程似然函数提供了高效且准确的近似，显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to computationally efficient GP training based on the observation that square-exponential (SE) covariance matrices contain several off-diagonal entries extremely close to zero. We construct a principled procedure to eliminate those entries to produce a \emph{banded}-matrix approximation to the original covariance, whose inverse and determinant can be computed at a reduced computational cost, thus contributing to an efficient approximation to the likelihood function. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method to preserve the structure of the original covariance in the 1D setting with SE kernel, and validate its computational efficiency against the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs.

TL;DR: EVEREST is a transformer-based model for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that combines uncertainty quantification and tail-risk modeling, achieving SOTA results on space-weather flare prediction with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting rare events in multivariate time-series faces challenges of severe class imbalance, long-range dependencies, and distributional uncertainty, requiring calibrated predictions and risk-aware estimation for high-stakes domains.

Method: Proposes EVEREST with four integrated components: (1) learnable attention bottleneck for temporal dynamics, (2) evidential head for aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty via Normal-Inverse-Gamma distribution, (3) extreme-value head for tail risk using Generalized Pareto Distribution, and (4) precursor head for early detection; jointly optimized with composite loss (focal loss + evidential NLL + EVT penalty).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class solar flares on decade-long space-weather data, with only 0.81M parameters and no inference overhead.

Conclusion: EVEREST delivers interpretable, calibrated rare-event forecasts efficiently on commodity hardware, suitable for industrial/weather/satellite applications; limitations include fixed-length input constraints and lack of multimodal support, motivating future streaming/multimodal extensions.

Abstract: Forecasting rare events in multivariate time-series data is challenging due to severe class imbalance, long-range dependencies, and distributional uncertainty. We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares. The model is compact, efficient to train on commodity hardware, and applicable to high-stakes domains such as industrial monitoring, weather, and satellite diagnostics. Limitations include reliance on fixed-length inputs and exclusion of image-based modalities, motivating future extensions to streaming and multimodal forecasting.

Conclusion: 该异常是微缩放的根本特性，UE5M3格式提供了硬件友好的有效解决方案，简化了实现复杂度。

Abstract: Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.

Conclusion: 该研究解决了线性离线策略评估中覆盖率概念不统一的问题，通过特征动力学覆盖参数实现了跨设定的一致性理论框架。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is a fundamental task in reinforcement learning (RL). In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \textrm{Evaluation error} \le \textrm{poly}(C^π, d, 1/n,\log(1/δ)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^π$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.
  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.

Abstract: A key challenge in employing data, algorithms and data-driven systems is to adhere to the principle of fairness and justice. Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion. The insights provided, we foresee, may trigger initiatives to improve or adjust the current practice and/or the existing legal frameworks.

Conclusion: 动态在线数据增强是提升时间序列基础模型的有效范式，OATS为数据增强提供了原则性策略，代码已开源

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) are a powerful paradigm for time series analysis and are often enhanced by synthetic data augmentation to improve the training data quality. Existing augmentation methods, however, typically rely on heuristics and static paradigms. Motivated by dynamic data optimization, which shows that the contribution of samples varies across training stages, we propose OATS (Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models), a principled strategy that generates synthetic data tailored to different training steps. OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on TSFMs demonstrate that OATS consistently outperforms regular training and yields substantial performance gains over static data augmentation baselines across six validation datasets and two TSFM architectures.

*Dipendra Misra,Aldo Pacchiano,Ta-Chung Chi,Ge Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper theoretically studies fine-tuning LLMs using natural user-edit data, unifying preferences, supervised labels, and cost feedback. It proposes an ensembling method that outperforms individual feedback approaches and adapts robustly to different user-edit distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User-edit deployment data from LLM applications is a natural source for model adaptation and personalization. The paper aims to unify different feedback types (preferences, supervised labels, cost) that are typically studied separately, and theoretically understand how to learn from this data effectively.

Method: The authors derive theoretical bounds for learning algorithms that use each feedback type individually, then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from all three feedback types (preferences, supervised labels, and cost).

Result: Experiments on two domains show the ensembling procedure outperforms methods that learn from individual feedback types. The proposed method also demonstrates robust adaptation to different user-edit distributions at test time.

Conclusion: Learning from natural user-edit data is effective for LLM adaptation. The ensembling approach that combines multiple feedback types is superior to single-feedback methods and provides robust performance across varying user behaviors.

Abstract: We study how to fine-tune LLMs using user-edit deployment data consisting of a set of context, an agent's response, and user edits. This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.

*W. A. Zúñiga-Galindo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the thermodynamic limit of neural networks, showing they transition from unique to infinite states via critical bifurcation. The authors use p-adic integers to model hierarchical structures and connect this to critical organization, while analyzing output distributions of random networks in infinite-width limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical properties and phase transitions of deep neural networks in infinite-width limits, and to mathematically characterize their hierarchical structures and critical behavior.

Method: Rigorous analysis of thermodynamic limits, p-adic integer frameworks for hierarchical topology, algorithm recasting architectures as tree-like structures, toy model analysis of edge detectors, and probabilistic analysis of Gaussian-random-parameter networks.

Result: Continuous networks exhibit unique states in specific parameter regions that bifurcate into infinite states elsewhere; hierarchical and critical organizations connect via p-adic structures; critical organization appears as strange attractor; random network output distributions follow power-type expansions with Gaussian leading term.

Conclusion: The work establishes a mathematical framework linking neural network hierarchy and criticality, demonstrating how infinite-width limits reveal fundamental organizational principles and probabilistic properties of deep learning systems.

Abstract: We rigorously study the thermodynamic limit of deep neural networks (DNNS) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), assuming that the activation functions are sigmoids. A thermodynamic limit is a continuous neural network, where the neurons form a continuous space with infinitely many points. We show that such a network admits a unique state in a certain region of the parameter space, which depends continuously on the parameters. This state breaks into an infinite number of states outside the mentioned region of parameter space. Then, the critical organization is a bifurcation in the parameter space, where a network transitions from a unique state to infinitely many states. We use p-adic integers to codify hierarchical structures. Indeed, we present an algorithm that recasts the hierarchical topologies used in DNNs and RNNs as p-adic tree-like structures. In this framework, the hierarchical and the critical organizations are connected. We study rigorously the critical organization of a toy model, a hierarchical edge detector for grayscale images based on p-adic cellular neural networks. The critical organization of such a network can be described as a strange attractor. In the second part, we study random versions of DNNs and RNNs. In this case, the network parameters are generalized Gaussian random variables in a space of quadratic integrable functions. We compute the probability distribution of the output given the input, in the infinite-width case. We show that it admits a power-type expansion, where the constant term is a Gaussian distribution.

*Joshua V. Dillon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 借鉴生物神经系统的"赢家通吃"和"首次放电时间编码"原理，该研究将Tiny Recursive Models集成预测策略改为仅采用第一个停止的模型输出，在数独求解任务上实现97.2%准确率，计算量仅为测试时增强(TTA)的1/10。通过在训练时维护K个并行潜在状态但仅反向传播损失最低的"赢家"，单模型单前向传播即可达到96.9%准确率，媲美TTA性能。研究还开发了改进版SwiGLU激活函数以使Muon优化器可行，所有实验仅使用单张RTX 5090完成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物神经系统必须在能量受限条件下快速响应，进化解决方案是"在首次信号时行动"。赢家通吃电路和首次放电时间编码隐含地将神经元放电时机视为置信度表达。本研究将此原理应用于Tiny Recursive Models集成，探索能否将推理速度作为模型的隐式置信度指标。

Method: 提出两种实现方式：(1) 集成方法：在TRM集成中，仅采用第一个停止推理的模型预测作为最终输出；(2) 训练时优化：单模型在训练中维护K=4个并行潜在状态，但仅对损失最低的"赢家"路径进行反向传播，使模型在推理时通过前向传播速度隐式表达置信度。开发了改进版SwiGLU激活函数以使Muon优化器在该架构上稳定训练。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme谜题上达到97.2%准确率，比单模型基线(86.1%)显著提升，且计算量仅为测试时增强(TTA)的1/10（TTA达97.3%）。单模型K=4训练策略实现96.9%±0.6%准确率，单次前向传播即匹配TTA性能。使用Muon优化器+K=1训练可在7k步(40分钟)超越基线，达到更高精度需36k步(K=1需1.5小时，K=4需6小时)。所有实验在单张RTX 5090上完成。

Conclusion: 推理速度可作为模型预测置信度的隐式表达，且该能力可通过训练-only成本实现。该方法在保持生物合理性的同时，显著提升计算效率，使单模型无需测试时增强即可达到集成性能，为资源受限场景下的高效推理提供新范式。

Abstract: Biological neural systems must be fast but are energy-constrained. Evolution's solution: act on the first signal. Winner-take-all circuits and time-to-first-spike coding implicitly treat when a neuron fires as an expression of confidence. We apply this principle to ensembles of Tiny Recursive Models (TRM). By basing the ensemble prediction solely on the first to halt rather than averaging predictions, we achieve 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme while using 10x less compute than test-time augmentation (the baseline achieves 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Inference speed is an implicit indication of confidence. But can this capability be manifested as a training-only cost? Evidently yes: by maintaining K = 4 parallel latent states during training but backpropping only through the lowest-loss "winner," a single model achieves 96.9% +/- 0.6% puzzle accuracy with a single forward pass-matching TTA performance without any test-time augmentation. As in nature, this work was also resource constrained: all experimentation used a single RTX 5090. This necessitated efficiency and compelled our invention of a modified SwiGLU which made Muon viable. With Muon and K = 1 training, we exceed TRM baseline performance in 7k steps (40 min). Higher accuracy requires 36k steps: 1.5 hours for K = 1, 6 hours for K = 4.

Abstract: While many deep learning models trained on private datasets have been deployed in various practical tasks, they may pose a privacy leakage risk as attackers could recover informative data or label knowledge from models. In this work, we present \emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经物理求解器在训练数据范围之外的泛化能力较差，这限制了其在探索新设计和长时间预测方面的应用，而这些能力对于科学发现至关重要。

Method: NOVA通过从初始稀疏场景集中学习物理对齐的表示，构建可泛化的神经物理求解器，能够处理偏微分方程参数、几何形状和初始条件的分布偏移。

Result: 在复杂的非线性问题（包括热传递、扩散反应和流体流动）上，NOVA的分布外误差比数据驱动基线低1-2个数量级，同时稳定了长时间动力学推演，并通过在非线性图灵系统和微流控芯片优化中的应用改善了生成式设计。

Conclusion: NOVA能够可靠地外推到已知范围之外，克服了传统神经物理求解器局限于先验空间内检索/仿真的限制，通过更广泛的假设空间探索促进了科学发现。

Abstract: Neural physics solvers are increasingly used in scientific discovery, given their potential for rapid in silico insights into physical, materials, or biological systems and their long-time evolution. However, poor generalization beyond their training support limits exploration of novel designs and long-time horizon predictions. We introduce NOVA, a route to generalizable neural physics solvers that can provide rapid, accurate solutions to scenarios even under distributional shifts in partial differential equation parameters, geometries and initial conditions. By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization. Unlike neural physics solvers that are constrained to retrieval and/or emulation within an a priori space, NOVA enables reliable extrapolation beyond known regimes, a key capability given the need for exploration of novel hypothesis spaces in scientific discovery

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发具备复杂多步推理能力的AI模型是核心目标，但GNN的消息传递机制存在局部瓶颈，限制了全局推理能力。

Method: 提出FloydNet架构，采用动态规划范式：维护全局全对关系张量，学习广义DP算子进行迭代优化，构建任务特定的关系演算框架。

Result: 理论证明达到3-WL(2-FWL)表达力，广义形式与k-FWL层次一致；在CLRS-30上实现>99%准确率；找到TSP精确最优解的概率显著超越强启发式方法；在BREC基准上匹配3-WL测试。

Conclusion: 学习的DP风格优化是高层次图推理中消息传递的强大且实用的替代方案。

Abstract: Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning.

*Lecheng Zheng,Dongqi Fu,Zihao Li,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes OWLEYE, a zero-shot graph anomaly detection framework that learns transferable normal patterns from multiple graphs via cross-domain feature alignment, multi-pattern dictionary learning, and truncated attention-based reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain graph data with varying feature semantics and dimensions hinders development of foundational generalist models for graph anomaly detection, making continual learning and inference capabilities challenging open problems.

Method: OWLEYE uses three components: (1) cross-domain feature alignment to harmonize distributions while preserving domain-specific semantics, (2) multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute patterns, and (3) truncated attention-based reconstruction for in-context learning on unseen graphs.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The framework successfully learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, enabling robust zero-shot anomaly detection on unseen graph-structured data without requiring labeled examples.

Abstract: Graph data is informative to represent complex relationships such as transactions between accounts, communications between devices, and dependencies among machines or processes. Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.

Motivation: Apple Silicon 的机器学习需求增长，但现有工具缺乏原生优化或仅支持文本模型，多模态负载未被满足

Method: 基于 MLX 原生开发，为文本模型提供连续批处理，为多模态模型引入内容哈希前缀缓存，消除重复视觉编码

Result: 文本吞吐量超 llama.cpp 21-87%，16 并发时达 4.3 倍聚合吞吐；多模态重复查询提速 28 倍，视频分析缓存加速 24.7 倍，M4 Max 上最高 525 tokens/s

Conclusion: 开源实现以支持消费级 Apple 硬件的高效推理

Abstract: The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models (llama.cpp), leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21% to 87% higher throughput than llama.cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.

Result: 模型在保持PCA有序表示和方差保留特性的同时，能够有效处理非线性降维任务

Conclusion: 该框架成功将PCA扩展到非线性场景，兼具主成分分析的理论优势和非线性自编码器的表达能力

Abstract: Autoencoders have long been considered a nonlinear extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Prior studies have demonstrated that linear autoencoders (LAEs) can recover the ordered, axis-aligned principal components of PCA by incorporating non-uniform $\ell_2$ regularization or by adjusting the loss function. However, these approaches become insufficient in the nonlinear setting, as the remaining variance cannot be properly captured independently of the nonlinear mapping. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder framework that integrates non-uniform variance regularization with an isometric constraint. This design serves as a natural generalization of PCA, enabling the model to preserve key advantages, such as ordered representations and variance retention, while remaining effective for nonlinear dimensionality reduction tasks.

Abstract: Risk disclosures in SEC filings describe potential adverse events but rarely quantify their likelihood, limiting their usefulness for probabilistic analysis. A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.
  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.
  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.
  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU. This result suggests a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring enterprise documents.
  To support transparency and reproducibility, we open-source the evaluation dataset used in this study.

Method: 提出加速多重Wasserstein梯度下降算法A-MWGraD，通过Nesterov加速框架改进MWGraD，分析其连续时间动力学，并设计基于核的离散化实现方法。

Result: 理论分析表明A-MWGraD在测地凸目标下达到O(1/t²)收敛率，在β-强测地凸目标下达到O(e^(-√βt))收敛率，均优于MWGraD的O(1/t)；数值实验验证了基于核的A-MWGraD在多目标采样任务中具有更快的收敛速度和更高的采样效率。

Conclusion: A-MWGraD成功实现了对MWGraD的有效加速，在理论收敛率和实际性能上均有显著提升，为Wasserstein空间中的多目标优化提供了更高效的算法框架。

Abstract: We study multi-objective optimization over probability distributions in Wasserstein space. Recently, Nguyen et al. (2025) introduced Multiple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD) algorithm, which exploits the geometric structure of Wasserstein space to jointly optimize multiple objectives. Building on this approach, we propose an accelerated variant, A-MWGraD, inspired by Nesterov's acceleration. We analyze the continuous-time dynamics and establish convergence to weakly Pareto optimal points in probability space. Our theoretical results show that A-MWGraD achieves a convergence rate of O(1/t^2) for geodesically convex objectives and O(e^{-\sqrtβt}) for $β$-strongly geodesically convex objectives, improving upon the O(1/t) rate of MWGraD in the geodesically convex setting. We further introduce a practical kernel-based discretization for A-MWGraD and demonstrate through numerical experiments that it consistently outperforms MWGraD in convergence speed and sampling efficiency on multi-target sampling tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架为RNA逆折叠提供了鲁棒性解决方案，对生物技术和治疗应用具有深远意义。

Abstract: RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

Motivation: Classical unsupervised anomaly detection methods produce results misaligned with business needs, while manual expert analysis cannot scale to millions of supply chain products. There's a critical gap between automated detection and expert-driven decision-making in operational settings.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data using domain knowledge, 2) Automated generation and iterative optimization of symbolic rules via LLMs, and 3) Rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories to enhance interpretability.

Result: Outperforms unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Provides consistent, deterministic results with lower computational latency and cost compared to direct LLM deployment, making it suitable for production environments.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates how LLMs can bridge the gap between scalable automation and expert-driven decision-making, enabling interpretable, business-aligned anomaly detection at scale in supply chain operations.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for supply chain management to take proactive operations, but faces challenges: classical unsupervised anomaly detection based on exploiting data patterns often yields results misaligned with business requirements and domain knowledge, while manual expert analysis cannot scale to millions of products in the supply chain. We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment. The proposed framework thus demonstrates how LLMs can bridge the gap between scalable automation and expert-driven decision-making in operational settings.

Result: 理论证明 E-QRGMM 保持 QRGMM 收敛速率的同时，将多数分位数水平的网格复杂度从 O(n^(1/2)) 降至 O(n^(1/5))，显著提升计算效率。在合成和实际数据集上，E-QRGMM 在分布精度与训练速度间取得更优权衡，并支持对任意估计量构建 bootstrap 置信区间。

Conclusion: E-QRGMM 为基于模拟的推理中的协变量依赖不确定性量化提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification in simulation-based inference is crucial for high-stakes decision-making but remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods such as conformal prediction and classical bootstrap, which struggle with covariate-specific conditioning. We propose Efficient Quantile-Regression-Based Generative Metamodeling (E-QRGMM), a novel framework that accelerates the quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling (QRGMM) approach by integrating cubic Hermite interpolation with gradient estimation. Theoretically, we show that E-QRGMM preserves the convergence rate of the original QRGMM while reducing grid complexity from $O(n^{1/2})$ to $O(n^{1/5})$ for the majority of quantile levels, thereby substantially improving computational efficiency. Empirically, E-QRGMM achieves a superior trade-off between distributional accuracy and training speed compared to both QRGMM and other advanced deep generative models on synthetic and practical datasets. Moreover, by enabling bootstrap-based construction of confidence intervals for arbitrary estimands of interest, E-QRGMM provides a practical solution for covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 传统分割学习因反向传播存在高通信和内存开销。本文提出超越反向传播的方法，客户端用辅助分类器提供局部误差，服务器用真实损失训练。性能与传统方法相当，但通信降低50%，内存降低58%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分割学习保护数据隐私，但传统端到端反向传播需每轮交换激活值和梯度，导致巨大通信和内存开销，限制实用性。

Method: 开发超越反向传播的训练方法：客户端和服务器半独立训练。客户端在分割点添加辅助分类器提供局部误差信号；服务器使用客户端传来的激活值和真实损失函数训练，消除发送反向梯度的需求。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上验证：1) 性能与传统反向传播分割学习相当；2) 通信量降低50%，峰值内存使用降低高达58%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了分割学习的通信和内存瓶颈，在保持准确率的同时显著提升效率，使分割学习更具实用性。

Abstract: Split learning is a distributed training paradigm where a neural network is partitioned between clients and a server, which allows data to remain at the client while only intermediate activations are shared. Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results. First, the proposed approach achieves performance on par with standard split learning that uses backpropagation. Second, it significantly reduces communication (of transmitting activations/gradient) by 50% and peak memory usage by up to 58%.

TL;DR: 该论文提出Multi-Adversary GDRO框架，通过动态难度分类和计算资源重分配解决LLM推理训练中的均匀采样效率问题，相比GRPO基线在pass@8准确率上获得约10%的相对提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RL范式（如GRPO）在异构重尾推理数据上存在结构性低效：均匀提示采样和固定rollout数量导致计算资源浪费在已解决的简单模式上，而对困难问题的长尾分布训练不足。

Method: 提出多对抗组分布鲁棒优化框架：1）在线难度分类器将提示按pass@k动态分组；2）Prompt-GDRO采用EMA去偏的乘权bandit采样器，针对困难组加权；3）Rollout-GDRO使用影子价格控制器在固定预算下重新分配rollout以最大化梯度方差减少。

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态适应训练分布，有效解决了均匀推理模型的结构性低效问题，在计算中性条件下显著提升LLM推理性能，为困难问题分配更多资源的同时避免频率偏差。

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning is increasingly driven by the refinement of post-training loss functions and alignment strategies. However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.
  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline. Qualitative analysis shows an emergent curriculum: the adversaries shift resources to the evolving reasoning frontier, enhancing the reasoning model's performance.

### [128] [Smoothing the Score Function for Generalization in Diffusion Models: An Optimization-based Explanation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19285)
*Xinyu Zhou,Jiawei Zhang,Stephen J. Wright*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework explaining memorization in diffusion models: the empirical score function uses sharp softmax weights that cause individual training samples to dominate, leading to sampling collapse. The authors propose two smoothing methods—Noise Unconditioning and Temperature Smoothing—to mitigate this issue, improving generalization while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models face a fundamental memorization problem where generated samples can exactly replicate training data, limiting their generalization ability.

Method: (1) Theoretical analysis showing empirical score function is a weighted sum of Gaussian score functions with sharp softmax weights causing sample dominance; (2) Noise Unconditioning for adaptive weight determination; (3) Temperature Smoothing with explicit temperature parameter to control softmax smoothness.

Result: Experiments across multiple datasets validate the theory and demonstrate the methods effectively improve generalization while preserving high generation quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework explains memorization in diffusion models, and the two smoothing techniques successfully mitigate single-sample dominance, enhancing generalization without sacrificing generation performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable generation quality, yet face a fundamental challenge known as memorization, where generated samples can replicate training samples exactly. We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization. Experiments across multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving generalization while maintaining high generation quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes StableQAT, a novel quantization-aware training framework that uses a Fourier analysis-based surrogate gradient to stabilize ultra-low-bit (2-4 bit) training, addressing limitations of STE and soft quantizers while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-low-bit QAT (2-4 bits) is challenging due to gradient mismatch, instability, and high computational overhead in existing methods like straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers.

Method: Proposes StableQAT, which uses a novel surrogate gradient derived from discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator, strictly generalizing STE while providing smooth, bounded, and computationally inexpensive gradients.

Result: Achieved stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bits with improved training stability, robustness, and performance compared to standard QAT techniques, with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: StableQAT provides a unified, theoretically grounded framework that stabilizes ultra-low-bit QAT without sacrificing efficiency, making it practical for deploying large models under strict memory and latency constraints.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is essential for deploying large models under strict memory and latency constraints, yet achieving stable and robust optimization at ultra-low bitwidths remains challenging. Common approaches based on the straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers often suffer from gradient mismatch, instability, or high computational overhead. As such, we propose StableQAT, a unified and efficient QAT framework that stabilizes training in ultra low-bit settings via a novel, lightweight, and theoretically grounded surrogate for backpropagation derived from a discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator. StableQAT strictly generalizes STE as the latter arises as a special case of our more expressive surrogate family, yielding smooth, bounded, and inexpensive gradients that improve QAT training performance and stability across various hyperparameter choices. In experiments, StableQAT exhibits stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bit regimes, demonstrating improved training stability, robustness, and superior performance with negligible training overhead against standard QAT techniques.

Motivation: 模型基强化学习虽样本效率高，但难以泛化到结构相似场景且易受纹理/颜色等伪变化干扰。受认知科学启发，人类将连续感知流分解为离散事件用于决策，但现有方法依赖手工标注事件标签。

Method: 提出EAWM框架：(1)自动化事件生成器从原始观测推导事件；(2)通用事件分割器(GES)识别事件边界；(3)通过事件预测塑造表征空间以捕获时空转换；(4)统一不同世界模型架构的数学表述。

Conclusion: EAWM提供了一种无需手工标注的事件感知表示学习框架，显著提升MBRL的泛化能力和鲁棒性，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法为不确定环境下提升模型可靠性提供了原则性且有效的框架，尤其适用于医疗影像等高风险决策场景

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in deep learning models is critical for reliable decision-making in high-stakes applications such as medical imaging. Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift. This work provides a principled and effective framework for enhancing model reliability in uncertain environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典薛定谔桥(SB)方法仅控制漂移项，而SBB框架同时控制漂移和波动率。现有方法计算效率低，需要开发更快速、可扩展的SBB求解器。

Method: LightSBB-M利用SBB目标的双重表示获得漂移和波动率的最优解析表达式，引入可调参数beta在纯漂移(SB)和纯波动率(Bass传输)之间插值，仅需数次迭代即可计算最优传输计划。

Conclusion: LightSBB-M提供了可扩展、高保真的SBB求解方案，在合成和真实世界生成任务中均优于现有基线，为传输问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation, which jointly controls drift and volatility, is an established extension of the classical Schrodinger Bridge (SB). Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks.

TL;DR: 针对大语言模型对抗攻击的激活引导技术，现有方法存在调参困难、控制粒度粗、破坏激活分布等问题。本文提出Selective Steering，通过数学严谨的保范数旋转和判别性层选择，实现5.5倍攻击成功率提升，零困惑度违规和近100%能力保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对齐取得进展，大语言模型仍易受对抗攻击。现有激活引导方法存在关键局限：激活添加需精细调参且对层范数变化敏感，方向性消融仅提供二进制控制，而Angular Steering虽实现连续控制但破坏范数保持，导致分布偏移和生成崩溃，尤其在7B参数以下模型中。

Method: 提出Selective Steering框架，包含两大创新：(1) 数学上严谨的保范数旋转公式，维持激活分布完整性；(2) 判别性层选择策略，仅在特征表示呈现相反符号类别对齐的层应用引导，实现精准干预。

Result: 在九个模型上的实验表明，该方法攻击成功率达先前方法的5.5倍，困惑度零违规，标准基准测试能力保留约100%。

Conclusion: 提供了一种原则性、高效的框架，用于可控且稳定的LLM行为修改，为安全对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering

TL;DR: This paper proposes unsupervised encoder-decoder models to learn generalizable IoT traffic representations from unlabeled data, achieving >0.9 F1-score for device classification across environments and showing that larger models don't guarantee better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IoT device identification methods rely on supervised pipelines that create traffic representations tightly coupled to specific labeled datasets and deployment environments, limiting their generalizability to new settings.

Method: Designing compact unsupervised encoder-decoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from 18M+ unlabeled IoT traffic flows, evaluated via a frozen-encoder protocol with lightweight supervised classifiers, plus systematic benchmarking against state-of-the-art pretrained encoders.

Result: Achieved macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, demonstrated robustness under cross-environment deployment, and found that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic.

Conclusion: Unsupervised learning of compact traffic representations from unlabeled data produces highly generalizable embeddings that enable effective IoT device identification across diverse deployment environments, challenging the assumption that model size alone determines representation quality.

Abstract: Machine learning models have demonstrated strong performance in classifying network traffic and identifying Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, enabling operators to discover and manage IoT assets at scale. However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment.

TL;DR: APC is a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple Normalizing Flow priors to effectively incorporate sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned demonstrations into RL without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods that use demonstration data assume demonstrations are optimal and fully aligned with the target task, but in practice they are often sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when integrated.

Method: Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow priors, estimates each prior's applicability to the target task, leverages them for exploration, and either refines useful priors or sidesteps misaligned ones to optimize downstream reward.

Result: Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning with aligned demonstrations, remains robust under severe misalignment, leverages suboptimal demonstrations for exploration, and avoids performance degradation from overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.

Conclusion: APC provides a robust approach to incorporating diverse quality demonstration data into RL by adaptively composing NF priors based on their estimated applicability, enabling effective learning across various demonstration conditions.

Abstract: Incorporating demonstration data into reinforcement learning (RL) can greatly accelerate learning, but existing approaches often assume demonstrations are optimal and fully aligned with the target task. In practice, demonstrations are frequently sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when these demonstrations are integrated into RL. We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典k-聚类算法需要精确的两两距离，这在许多现代应用中是不现实的。秩模型用四元组预言机（提供相对距离比较）替代精确距离，更能代表学习模型或人类反馈，但预言机是噪声且访问成本高昂的。

Method: 设计仅使用噪声四元组预言机的随机化算法，计算O(k·polylog(n))个中心点及输入点到中心点的映射，使得聚类成本是k-聚类最优成本的常数倍。

Result: 对于任意度量空间，查询复杂度为O(n·k·polylog(n))；当底层度量空间具有有界双倍维数时，优化至O((n+k²)·polylog(n))，且可将近似比从常数提升至1+ε（ε为任意小常数），同时保持相同的渐进查询复杂度。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了如何将大型语言模型等噪声、低成本预言机系统性地集成到可扩展聚类算法中。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning. However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.
  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\cdot k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity. Our framework demonstrates how noisy, low-cost oracles, such as those derived from large language models, can be systematically integrated into scalable clustering algorithms.

TL;DR: LLM-VA通过闭式权重更新对齐答案向量与安全向量，解决安全对齐大模型的越狱与过度拒绝权衡问题，在无需微调的情况下实现F1分数提升11.45%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全对齐的大语言模型存在越狱（回答有害输入）和过度拒绝（拒绝良性查询）两种失败模式。现有向量控制方法通过调整答案向量幅度，但会产生根本性权衡——减少越狱会增加过度拒绝，反之亦然。

Method: 作者发现大模型将近乎正交的答案向量(v_a)和良性向量(v_b)作为独立过程处理。LLM-VA通过闭式最小范数权重更新对齐这两个向量，使模型回答意愿依赖于安全评估。方法使用SVM识别每层向量，选择安全相关层，并迭代对齐向量，无需微调或架构修改。

Result: 在12个大模型上的实验表明，LLM-VA比最佳基线F1分数高11.45%，同时保持95.92%的效用，且能自动适应各模型的安全偏置而无需手动调参。

Conclusion: LLM-VA通过对齐答案与安全表征解决了越狱/过度拒绝的权衡问题，提供了一种无需架构变更或微调的简单有效闭式解法，适用于多样化的大语言模型。

Abstract: Safety-aligned LLMs suffer from two failure modes: jailbreak (answering harmful inputs) and over-refusal (declining benign queries). Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications.

Motivation: 现有深度模型缺乏对中间表示的结构保证，导致早期停止和自适应计算问题定义不明确。

Method: 制定状态空间模型的尺度一致潜在动力学结构要求，推导出FROST，通过分形归纳偏置强制自相似表示流形，使中间状态对应于共享表示的不同分辨率。

Result: 几何分析证明了迭代过程中的收缩和稳定收敛；停止条件可基于内在特征质量而非外在目标；ImageNet-100实验验证了尺度一致行为及自适应效率。

Conclusion: 尺度一致结构使自适应计算与内在停止标准成为可能，分形归纳偏置有效解决了非结构深度模型的局限性。

Abstract: Recent deep learning models increasingly rely on depth without structural guarantees on the validity of intermediate representations, rendering early stopping and adaptive computation ill-posed. We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias. Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives. Controlled experiments on ImageNet-100 empirically verify the predicted scale-consistent behavior, showing that adaptive efficiency emerges from the aligned latent geometry.

Motivation: 现有嗅觉数据集规模小且在单分子和混合物之间碎片化，限制了可泛化的气味表示学习。现有方法将这些领域分开处理，阻碍了对齐和统一学习。

Method: 该框架使用化学基础模型编码单个分子，并使用基于注意力的聚合器组合混合物，同时保持置换不变性并捕获不对称的分子相互作用。它通过知识蒸馏和类别感知的伪标记来对齐气味描述符，以处理缺失的混合物注释。

Conclusion: 该统一嵌入空间成功桥接了单分子和混合物，实现了更有效的气味表示学习，并为该领域设立了新的基准。

Abstract: Public olfaction datasets are small and fragmented across single molecules and mixtures, limiting learning of generalizable odor representations. Recent works either learn single-molecule embeddings or address mixtures via similarity or pairwise label prediction, leaving representations separate and unaligned. In this work, we propose AROMMA, a framework that learns a unified embedding space for single molecules and two-molecule mixtures. Each molecule is encoded by a chemical foundation model and the mixtures are composed by an attention-based aggregator, ensuring both permutation invariance and asymmetric molecular interactions. We further align odor descriptor sets using knowledge distillation and class-aware pseudo-labeling to enrich missing mixture annotations. AROMMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-molecule and molecule-pair datasets, with up to 19.1% AUROC improvement, demonstrating a robust generalization in two domains.

TL;DR: 针对无标注数据下大语言模型领域适应难题，本文提出发散引导推理课程(DGRC)框架，通过动态利用师生推理路径分歧构建原子知识到推理链的双课程，实现细粒度知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法易陷入粗粒度模仿，学生模型难以精准定位自身弱点且存在继承教师推理缺陷的风险，核心困境在于教师模型非完美专家时如何设计可靠教学课程。

Method: 基于大语言模型在原子子问题上高保真但在复杂推理中易出错的特性，提出DGRC框架。当师生推理结果冲突时，教师执行诊断分析：对比两条推理路径生成针对性原子查询并自答，构建高置信度原子问答对。这些对既作为原子课程修补学生知识缺口，又作为事实标准筛选教师推理链，形成从原子知识到完整推理路径的验证链式课程。

Result: 医疗与法律领域的跨领域实验表明，DGRC框架对不同规模学生模型均有效，其中1.5B参数模型在医疗领域相对强基线提升7.76%。

Conclusion: DGRC框架通过动态构建互补课程解决教师不可靠的教学困境，为无标注数据下大语言模型领域适应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains without human-annotated data is a crucial yet formidable challenge. Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline.

*Jiří Němeček,Mark Kozdoba,Illia Kryvoviaz,Tomáš Pevný,Jakub Mareček*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an MIO-based framework for training interpretable classifiers that control intersectional bias below regulatory thresholds in high-risk AI domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulatory demands (e.g., EU AI Act) require fair AI in high-risk fields like healthcare/finance but lack clear bias definitions; true fairness requires addressing bias at intersections of protected groups.

Method: Leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to build intrinsically interpretable classifiers; proves equivalence of two intersectional fairness metrics (MSD/SPSF) for detecting worst-case unfair subgroups.

Result: MIO algorithm outperforms existing methods in bias detection; trains high-performance classifiers with intersectional bias bounded below user-defined thresholds while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: Provides a robust, regulation-compliant solution for industries requiring auditable fairness through interpretable models with mathematically guaranteed bias control.

Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence in high-risk domains, such as finance and healthcare, necessitates models that are both fair and transparent. While regulatory frameworks, including the EU's AI Act, mandate bias mitigation, they are deliberately vague about the definition of bias. In line with existing research, we argue that true fairness requires addressing bias at the intersections of protected groups. We propose a unified framework that leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and intrinsically interpretable classifiers. We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond.

*Xudong Han,Senkang Hu,Yihang Tao,Yu Guo,Philip Birch,Sam Tak Wu Kwong,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new Domain Generalization method called DSP-Reg uses parameter-level sensitivity analysis to identify and suppress domain-specific parameters, achieving 66.7% average accuracy on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DG methods focus on domain-invariant features but ignore parameter-level analysis, preventing explicit differentiation between domain-sensitive and robust parameters, which limits generalization capability.

Method: Proposes a covariance-based framework to quantify parameter sensitivity by computing covariance of parameter gradients across source domains, then introduces DSP-Reg - a soft regularization that encourages reliance on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing domain-specific ones.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet benchmarks with an average accuracy of 66.7%, surpassing all baselines.

Conclusion: The parameter-level regularization framework provides granular control over model learning, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) is a critical area that focuses on developing models capable of performing well on data from unseen distributions, which is essential for real-world applications. Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\% and surpassing all baselines.

### [143] [Explicit Multi-head Attention for Inter-head Interaction in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19611)
*Runyu Peng,Yunhua Zhou,Demin Song,Kai Lv,Bo Wang,Qipeng Guo,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA) that explicitly models cross-head interaction via Head-level Linear Composition and Group Normalization, enabling faster pretraining convergence, better task performance, and 50% KV-cache compression with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer attention lacks explicit modeling of inter-head interaction despite evidence of its performance benefits; MEA aims to directly enable rich cross-head communication for improved robustness and efficiency.

Method: Introduces two components: (1) Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) applying learnable linear combinations to keys/values across heads for inter-head communication, and (2) head-level Group Normalization to align statistical properties of recombined heads.

Result: Achieves faster convergence via higher learning rates, lower validation loss, improved task performance; reduces KV-cache memory by 50% with negligible loss on knowledge/reasoning tasks (3.59% drop only on Olympiad math benchmarks).

Conclusion: MEA provides an effective, parameter-efficient attention mechanism that enhances training dynamics and enables practical memory optimization through virtual head reconstruction, making it suitable for resource-constrained deployments.

Abstract: In large language models built upon the Transformer architecture, recent studies have shown that inter-head interaction can enhance attention performance. Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEAFormer是一种用于解决现实世界车辆路径问题(RWVRPs)的新型Transformer，它通过聚类邻近注意力(CPA)将复杂度降至O(n)，并采用轻量级边感知模块，在大型现实世界和经典VRP基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界车辆路径问题需要解决具有时间窗、补给/充电站、非对称旅行成本等约束的大规模序列依赖挑战，但现有神经方法因忽视序列依赖性和未充分利用定义RWVRP复杂性的边级信息而表现不佳。

Method: SEAFormer包含两大创新：(1)聚类邻近注意力(CPA)，利用局部感知聚类将注意力复杂度从O(n²)降至O(n)同时保持全局视野；(2)轻量级边感知模块，通过残差融合捕获成对特征，有效整合边信息并加速收敛。

Result: 在四种RWVRP变体上的广泛实验表明，SEAFormer性能优于先进方法，是首个能有效解决1000+节点RWVRPs的神经方法，同时在经典VRP上也表现优异。

Conclusion: SEAFormer为研究基准和实际应用中的车辆路径问题提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (RWVRPs) require solving complex, sequence-dependent challenges at scale with constraints such as delivery time window, replenishment or recharging stops, asymmetric travel cost, etc. While recent neural methods achieve strong results on large-scale classical VRP benchmarks, they struggle to address RWVRPs because their strategies overlook sequence dependencies and underutilize edge-level information, which are precisely the characteristics that define the complexity of RWVRPs. We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances. Second, our lightweight edge-aware module captures pairwise features through residual fusion, enabling effective incorporation of edge-based information and faster convergence. Extensive experiments across four RWVRP variants with various scales demonstrate that SEAFormer achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SEAFormer is the first neural method to solve 1,000+ node RWVRPs effectively, while also achieving superior performance on classic VRPs, making it a versatile solution for both research benchmarks and real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出SOOPER方法解决强化学习的安全探索问题，该方法融合保守策略先验与概率动力学模型，实现乐观探索与悲观回退，在理论保证安全的前提下收敛至最优策略，实验验证其优越性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全探索是在线强化学习的关键需求，尤其是在非受控环境（如真实世界）中，智能体必须在不发生危险的情况下学习和适应。

Method: 提出SOOPER（Safe OPE with Conservative Policy Prior）方法，利用离线数据或模拟器获得的次优保守策略作为先验，通过概率动力学模型进行乐观探索，同时在必要时悲观地回退到保守策略以确保安全。

Result: 理论证明了SOOPER在整个学习过程中提供安全保障，通过界定累积遗憾证明其能够收敛到最优策略；在关键安全强化学习基准测试和真实硬件上的广泛实验表明，SOOPER具有可扩展性，性能优于现有最先进方法，并验证了理论保证在实际中的有效性。

Conclusion: SOOPER为安全强化学习提供了一种有效解决方案，成功地将理论安全保证与实际性能优势相结合，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Safe exploration is a key requirement for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn and adapt online, beyond controlled (e.g. simulated) environments. In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analog IC design automation faces challenges due to complex interdependencies between layout, parasitic effects, and performance that conventional methods struggle to optimize. While ML shows promise, progress is hindered by limited open, high-quality analog datasets, restricting benchmarking and generalizability of ML techniques.

Method: The authors present OSIRIS, a scalable pipeline that systematically explores analog circuit design spaces while generating comprehensive performance metrics and metadata. They also develop a reinforcement learning-based baseline method that leverages OSIRIS for analog design optimization.

Result: The pipeline generates and releases a dataset of 87,100 circuit variations. The accompanying RL baseline demonstrates practical application of the dataset for analog design optimization tasks.

Conclusion: OSIRIS addresses critical data limitations in analog EDA, providing a foundation for ML-driven research and enabling more holistic, end-to-end analog design automation frameworks.

Abstract: The automation of analog integrated circuit (IC) design remains a longstanding challenge, primarily due to the intricate interdependencies among physical layout, parasitic effects, and circuit-level performance. These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 87,100 circuit variations generated with OSIRIS, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)-based baseline method that exploits OSIRIS for analog design optimization.

Conclusion: R^3 机制通过多维度历史经验利用和熵-based奖励设计，有效解决了群体策略优化的训练不稳定性问题，为大规模推理模型提供了更高效的强化学习范式。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) aim to solve diverse and complex problems through structured reasoning. Recent advances in group-based policy optimization methods have shown promise in enabling stable advantage estimation without reliance on process-level annotations. However, these methods rely on advantage gaps induced by high-quality samples within the same batch, which makes the training process fragile and inefficient when intra-group advantages collapse under challenging tasks. To address these problems, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism named \emph{\textbf{R^3}} that along three directions: (1) a \emph{cross-context \underline{\textbf{R}}eplay} strategy that maintains the intra-group advantage by recalling valuable examples from historical trajectories of the same query, (2) an \emph{in-context self-\underline{\textbf{R}}eflection} mechanism enabling models to refine outputs by leveraging past failures, and (3) a \emph{structural entropy \underline{\textbf{R}}anking reward}, which assigns relative rewards to truncated or failed samples by ranking responses based on token-level entropy patterns, capturing both local exploration and global stability. We implement our method on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and train it on the DeepscaleR-40k in the math domain. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves SoTA performance on several math benchmarks, representing significant improvements and fewer reasoning tokens over the base models. Code and model will be released.

TL;DR: ProToken is a novel provenance method for token-level attribution in federated LLMs that achieves 98% accuracy in identifying which clients contributed to specific generated tokens while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated LLMs enable collaborative training while preserving privacy, but lack of client attribution for generated responses hinders debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification in critical applications.

Method: ProToken uses two key insights: (1) strategic layer selection based on task-specific signal concentration in later transformer blocks for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting to filter irrelevant neural activations and focus on neurons directly influencing token generation.

Result: Evaluated across 16 configurations with four LLM architectures and four domains, ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in localizing responsible clients and maintains high accuracy when scaling the number of clients.

Conclusion: The methodology validates practical viability for real-world deployment settings, addressing client attribution challenges in federated LLMs while maintaining privacy constraints.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Large Language Models (LLMs) across distributed data sources while preserving privacy. However, when federated LLMs are deployed in critical applications, it remains unclear which client(s) contributed to specific generated responses, hindering debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification. We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings.

Conclusion: 该气候感知迁移学习方法显著降低数据需求，加速项目开发，为早期风资源评估等应用开辟新机会，有效缓解项目风险。

Abstract: Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.

Conclusion: ODEdit通过不变性学习有效解决了MLLM知识编辑的OOD泛化挑战，为构建更可靠的多模态知识更新系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.

Abstract: Real-world physical systems are inherently complex, often involving the coupling of multiple physics, making their simulation both highly valuable and challenging. Many mainstream approaches face challenges when dealing with decoupled data. Besides, they also suffer from low efficiency and fidelity in strongly coupled spatio-temporal physical systems. Here we propose GenCP, a novel and elegant generative paradigm for coupled multiphysics simulation. By formulating coupled-physics modeling as a probability modeling problem, our key innovation is to integrate probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, thereby enabling training on data from decoupled simulation and inferring coupled physics during sampling. We also utilize operator-splitting theory in the space of probability evolution to establish error controllability guarantees for this "conditional-to-joint" sampling scheme. We evaluate our paradigm on a synthetic setting and three challenging multi-physics scenarios to demonstrate both principled insight and superior application performance of GenCP.

*Octavio Pappalardo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ULEE是一种无监督元学习方法，通过对抗性目标生成和动态课程学习策略，在预训练阶段将智能体保持在能力边界进行训练，从而提升强化学习智能体在未知下游任务上的探索、适应能力和零样本/少样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督预训练能为强化学习智能体提供先验知识，但现有方法在广泛分布的下游任务中面临挑战，特别是当任务身份未知或超出预训练分布时，零样本解决所有任务不可行。核心问题是如何有效生成、选择和从自设目标中学习。

Result: 在XLand-MiniGrid基准测试中，ULEE预训练显著提升了智能体的探索和适应能力，可泛化到新颖目标、环境动态和地图结构。其策略实现了更好的零样本/少样本性能，并为长周期微调提供强初始化，性能优于从零学习、DIAYN预训练及其他课程学习方法。

Conclusion: ULEE通过对抗性课程设计有效解决了无监督元学习中的目标生成与选择难题，为智能体在开放世界任务中的快速适应提供了新范式，展现了强大的泛化能力和实用价值。

Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training can equip reinforcement learning agents with prior knowledge and accelerate learning in downstream tasks. A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures. The resulting policy attains improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, and provides a strong initialization for longer fine-tuning processes. It outperforms learning from scratch, DIAYN pre-training, and alternative curricula.

TL;DR: 本文通过测度论框架分析InfoNCE对比学习，揭示单峰与多峰机制的根本几何分岔，将分析视角从逐点判别转向群体几何，为控制分布失准提供理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法（如InfoNCE）的几何机制在alignment-uniformity分解之外尚未被充分刻画。

Method: 提出测度论框架，将学习建模为嵌入流形上表征测度的演化，在大batch极限下建立值和梯度一致性，将随机目标与确定性能量景观联系起来。

Result: 揭示单峰与多峰机制间的根本几何分岔：单峰设置下内在景观严格凸且有唯一Gibbs平衡，熵仅起打破平局作用；而对称多峰目标包含持续负对称散度项，引发屏障驱动的协同适应，强制形成结构性的模态间隙。

Conclusion: 将分析视角从逐点判别转向群体几何，为诊断和控制分布失准提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: While InfoNCE powers modern contrastive learning, its geometric mechanisms remain under-characterized beyond the canonical alignment--uniformity decomposition. We present a measure-theoretic framework that models learning as the evolution of representation measures on a fixed embedding manifold. By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying "uniformity" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment.

*Hongyaoxing Gu,Lijuan Hu,Liye Yu,Haowei Li,Fangfang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoPRo is a fine-tuning-free PTQ method that uses block-wise permutation, Walsh-Hadamard transforms, and R1SVD-based mixed-precision decomposition to achieve SOTA 2-3 bit quantization accuracy for LLMs with up to 4x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sub-3-bit weight-only PTQ methods suffer significant accuracy degradation and require computationally expensive fine-tuning to recover performance. The paper identifies fundamental challenges in residual matrix quantization under low-rank approximation.

Method: Proposes LoPRo: (1) Applies block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance while preserving salient blocks' quantization accuracy; (2) Introduces mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition via rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to minimize quantization costs.

Result: Outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at 2-bit and 3-bit, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Achieves SOTA on LLaMA-2/3 with 4x speedup, quantizes Mixtral-8x7B in 2.5 hours (perplexity -0.4, accuracy +8%), and maintains high inference efficiency with minimal latency.

Conclusion: LoPRo successfully enables fine-tuning-free PTQ that matches fine-tuning-based performance while offering substantial computational savings, making it practical for large-scale LLM deployment.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables effective model compression while preserving relatively high accuracy. Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\%$\uparrow$. Moreover, compared to other low-rank quantization methods, LoPRo achieves superior accuracy with a significantly lower rank, while maintaining high inference efficiency and minimal additional latency.

TL;DR: Qflex is a novel reinforcement learning method that uses value-guided probability flows for exploration in high-dimensional action spaces, outperforming existing methods and successfully controlling complex systems like human musculoskeletal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional control systems in robotics and biology face challenges with exploration efficiency as dimensionality grows. Traditional RL exploration strategies degrade sharply, while dimensionality reduction methods limit policy expressiveness and system flexibility.

Method: Q-guided Flow Exploration (Qflex) - conducts exploration directly in native high-dimensional action space by traversing actions from a learnable source distribution along a probability flow induced by the learned value function, aligning exploration with task-relevant gradients instead of isotropic noise.

Result: Substantially outperforms representative online RL baselines across diverse high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks. Successfully controls a full-body human musculoskeletal model for agile movements, demonstrating superior scalability and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Value-guided flows provide a principled and practical approach to scalable exploration in high-dimensional reinforcement learning problems.

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional systems in biological and robotic applications is challenging due to expansive state-action spaces, where effective exploration is critical. Commonly used exploration strategies in reinforcement learning are largely undirected with sharp degradation as action dimensionality grows. Many existing methods resort to dimensionality reduction, which constrains policy expressiveness and forfeits system flexibility. We introduce Q-guided Flow Exploration (Qflex), a scalable reinforcement learning method that conducts exploration directly in the native high-dimensional action space. During training, Qflex traverses actions from a learnable source distribution along a probability flow induced by the learned value function, aligning exploration with task-relevant gradients rather than isotropic noise. Our proposed method substantially outperforms representative online reinforcement learning baselines across diverse high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks. Qflex also successfully controls a full-body human musculoskeletal model to perform agile, complex movements, demonstrating superior scalability and sample efficiency in very high-dimensional settings. Our results indicate that value-guided flows offer a principled and practical route to exploration at scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 现有划分式层次聚类(DHC)方法因采用面向集合的二分评估标准，导致树状图缺乏无无根据分裂、组内相似、与真实标签对应等三个期望属性。本文提出用分布核替代该标准，以最大化聚类总相似度(TSC)为目标，理论保证TSC下界，并在空间转录组学数据上验证其能生成符合生物区域的树状图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于目标的DHC方法存在根本缺陷：使用面向集合的二分评估标准，导致生成的树状图不具备三个关键性质（无无根据分裂、相似聚类归入同一子集、与真实标签对应），亟需新方法来解决这一局限性。

Method: 采用分布核替代传统的面向集合评估标准，构建面向分布的新目标函数——最大化所有聚类的总相似度(TSC)，实现更合理的层次聚类划分。

Result: 理论分析证明该方法能保证TSC的下界；在人工和空间转录组学数据集上的实验验证了其有效性，成功生成与生物区域一致的树状图，而其他对比方法均失败。

Conclusion: 所提分布核DHC方法有效克服了现有方法的不足，能产生更具生物学意义的层次聚类结果，为空间组学数据分析提供了可靠的新工具。

Abstract: We uncover that current objective-based Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC) methods produce a dendrogram that does not have three desired properties i.e., no unwarranted splitting, group similar clusters into a same subset, ground-truth correspondence. This shortcoming has their root cause in using a set-oriented bisecting assessment criterion. We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC). Our theoretical analysis shows that the resultant dendrogram guarantees a lower bound of TSC. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed method on artificial and Spatial Transcriptomics (bioinformatics) datasets. Our proposed method successfully creates a dendrogram that is consistent with the biological regions in a Spatial Transcriptomics dataset, whereas other contenders fail.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解重尾梯度噪声下的算法泛化提供了理论基础，并可推广至多种随机优化算法。

Abstract: The empirical evidence indicates that stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed gradient noise is more appropriate to characterize the training of machine learning models than that with standard bounded gradient variance noise. Most existing works on this phenomenon focus on the convergence of optimization errors, while the analysis for generalization bounds under the heavy-tailed gradient noise remains limited. In this paper, we develop a general framework for establishing generalization bounds under heavy-tailed noise. Specifically, we introduce a truncation argument to achieve the generalization error bound based on the algorithmic stability under the assumption of bounded $p$th centered moment with $p\in(1,2]$. Building on this framework, we further provide the stability and generalization analysis for several popular stochastic algorithms under heavy-tailed noise, including clipped and normalized stochastic gradient descent, as well as their mini-batch and momentum variants.

TL;DR: This paper proposes GraphDLG, a novel method that successfully recovers raw training graphs from shared gradients in federated graph learning, demonstrating serious privacy vulnerabilities by decoupling graph structure and node features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While federated graph learning preserves privacy, the deep leakage from gradients (DLG) vulnerability remains underexplored for graph data. Prior work focused on images/text, leaving open whether entangled graph structures and node features in GNNs can be effectively recovered from gradients.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze FGL components and derive that graph structure recovery enables subsequent node feature reconstruction via a closed-form recursive rule. They propose GraphDLG, which uses auxiliary graphs (randomly generated or client-side training graphs) to enhance recovery from shared gradients.

Result: GraphDLG significantly outperforms existing methods by successfully decoupling graph structure and node features. It achieves over 5.46% improvement in MSE for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% improvement in AUC for graph structure reconstruction.

Conclusion: The work reveals a critical privacy vulnerability in federated graph learning, demonstrating that raw training graphs can be effectively reconstructed from gradients, which necessitates stronger privacy protection mechanisms in FGL systems.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has recently emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed graph learning across multiple data owners. A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphDLG outperforms existing solutions by successfully decoupling the graph structure and node features, achieving improvements of over 5.46% (by MSE) for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% (by AUC) for graph structure reconstruction.

Conclusion: FedKACE通过三项技术创新成功解决了流式联邦持续学习的核心挑战，为动态环境下的分布式学习提供了可行方案

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) leverages inter-client collaboration to balance new knowledge acquisition and prior knowledge retention in non-stationary data. However, existing batch-based FCL methods lack adaptability to streaming scenarios featuring category overlap between old and new data and absent task identifiers, leading to indistinguishability of old and new knowledge, uncertain task assignments for samples, and knowledge confusion.To address this, we propose streaming federated continual learning setting: per federated learning (FL) round, clients process streaming data with disjoint samples and potentially overlapping categories without task identifiers, necessitating sustained inference capability for all prior categories after each FL round.Next, we introduce FedKACE: 1) an adaptive inference model switching mechanism that enables unidirectional switching from local model to global model to achieve a trade-off between personalization and generalization; 2) a adaptive gradient-balanced replay scheme that reconciles new knowledge learning and old knowledge retention under overlapping-class scenarios; 3) a kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance that preserves high-information and high-boundary-influence samples to optimize cross-round knowledge retention. Experiments across multiple scenarios and regret analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKACE.

Result: 该框架通过多方向训练增强双层优化，显著提升了对未见异常类别的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了数据稀缺下的类别通用异常检测问题，实现了对新异常类别的强泛化检测性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the objective is to develop a unified model by focusing our learning on the available normal data and a small amount of anomaly data in order to detect the completely unseen anomalies, also referred to as the out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes.

Motivation: With publicly available human text predicted to be exhausted within a decade, improving models without ground-truth labels becomes crucial for future AI development.

Method: Framework uses a weaker but better-calibrated reference model to post-process a strong miscalibrated model. It formalizes the condition for strict improvement (non-mutual calibration), connects it to economic arbitrage theory, and develops an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels.

Result: Experiments on LLMs across scales show significant reduction in proper losses and calibration errors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines.

Conclusion: The label-free post-processing framework provides a theoretically grounded, practical solution for improving model performance without ground-truth labels, addressing future data scarcity challenges.

Abstract: Villalobos et al. [2024] predict that publicly available human text will be exhausted within the next decade. Thus, improving models without access to ground-truth labels becomes increasingly important. We propose a label-free post-processing framework that improves a strong but miscalibrated model using a weaker yet better-calibrated reference. Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels. Experiments on representative LLMs across varying scales demonstrate that our label-free method significantly reduces proper losses and calibration errors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines.

Conclusion: Highway连接的Post-LN架构为构建深度可扩展LLM提供简单有效的基础，开启了无限深度架构的可能性

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning is challenging for foundation models. On-policy reinforcement learning reduces forgetting but requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) from expert demonstrations is inherently off-policy and suffers from catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT) leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher to generate on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills.

Result: SDFT consistently outperforms SFT across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, it enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression.

Conclusion: On-policy distillation establishes a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations, effectively balancing new skill acquisition with preservation of existing capabilities.

Abstract: Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without degrading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models. While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable.

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper uses Jordan-Wigner transformation to map 1D spin chains (Ising/XY models) to fermion systems, revealing that all finite-size corrections in spin ground-state energy are manifestations of lattice fermionic Casimir effects, with various types including conventional, damping, vanishing, and oscillating behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To elucidate the fundamental relationship between finite-size corrections in spin representation and fermionic Casimir effects, establishing a unified theoretical framework to interpret these corrections across different quantum many-body systems.

Method: Applying Jordan-Wigner transformation to map one-dimensional transverse-field Ising and XY models from spin operators to fermionic operators, then analyzing the ground-state energy finite-size corrections in the fermion representation.

Result: All finite-size corrections in the studied spin models are shown to be interpretable as lattice fermionic Casimir effects, revealing four distinct phenomena: conventional Casimir energy from massless fields, damping from massive fields, vanishing from flat/nonrelativistic bands, and oscillating behavior from finite-density effects.

Conclusion: The findings create a direct dictionary connecting finite-size corrections in spin chains to fermionic Casimir effects, providing experimentally accessible platforms (quantum simulators) to observe and study these phenomena.

Abstract: The Jordan-Wigner transformation connects spin operators in one-dimensional spin systems and fermionic operators. In this work, we elucidate the relationship between the finite-size corrections in the spin representation and the fermionic Casimir effect in the corresponding fermion representation. In particular, we focus on the ground-state energy of one-dimensional transverse-field Ising and XY models, and show that all finite-size corrections can be interpreted as lattice fermionic Casimir effects. We further find several types of Casimir phenomena, such as the conventional Casimir energy from massless fields, damping behavior from massive fields, vanishing behavior from flat or nonrelativistic bands, and oscillating behavior from the finite-density effect. Our findings establish a dictionary between finite-size corrections in spin chains and fermionic Casimir effects, and provide experimentally relevant platforms for the fermionic Casimir phenomena.

Conclusion: P与NP问题存在细粒度结构，NP完全问题的难度分布可能呈现区域化特征，这为理解计算复杂性提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: We introduce the idea that the P vs NP problem can have a finer structure. Given the NP complete problem of interest, the configurations space of the problem can be divided in (at least) two regions. In one region, polynomial algorithms to solve the NP complete problem of interest are available (and we discuss one possible realization inspire by the games of chess and go). In the second region the problem to find polynomial time algorithms is very similar to the problem to find polynomial time algorithms to determine the asymptotic behavior of discrete dynamical systems in the chaotic regime. We cannot exclude the existence of a third region which separates the first two: this region would have the characteristics of the edge of chaos. We focuss on the Wang tiling problem of an N X N square (with N large): here a Wang tiles set Gamma is an alphabet. We construct a statistical-physics inspired heuristic which allows to define good alphabets as the ones with a good thermodynamical behavior. For (a suitable subclass of) good alphabets we construct an algortihm which, in polynomial time, determines how to tile the N x N square. On the other hand, for bad alphabets, we observe a chaotic behavior. The Cook-Levin theorem advocate a similar pattern for all the NP-complete problems.

Method: 分析由Z₂对称耦合项连接的两个堆叠量子伊辛子系统的全局基态，聚焦于子系统S的量子关联及其与弱耦合环境E和耦合参数w的关系。

Result: 当两个子系统均临界时，相同子系统等价于量子Ashkin-Teller模型；一维系统存在ν连续变化的临界线；二维系统出现量子多临界点，对称性从Z₂⊕Z₂增强至O(2)。

Conclusion: 耦合临界量子系统的普适类强烈依赖维度：一维展现参数依赖的临界指数，二维展现对称性增强的多临界行为，为量子相变理论提供了新见解。

Abstract: We analyze the quantum states of an isolated composite system consisting of two stacked quantum Ising (SQI) subsystems, coupled by a local Hamiltonian term that preserves the $Z_2$ symmetry of each subsystem. The coupling strength is controlled by an intercoupling parameter $w$, with $w=0$ corresponding to decoupled quantum Ising systems. We focus on the quantum correlations of one of the two SQI subsystems, $S$, in the ground state of the global system, and study their dependence on both the state of the weakly-coupled complementary part $E$ and the intercoupling strength. We concentrate on regimes in which $S$ develops critical long-range correlations. The most interesting physical scenario arises when both SQI subsystems are critical. In particular, for identical SQI subsystems, the global system is equivalent to the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, characterized by an additional $Z_2$ interchange symmetry between the two subsystem operators. In this limit, one-dimensional SQI systems exhibit a peculiar critical line along which the length-scale critical exponent $ν$ varies continuously with $w$, while two-dimensional systems develop quantum multicritical behaviors characterized by an effective enlargement of the symmetry of the critical modes, from the actual $Z_2\oplus Z_2$ symmetry to a continuous O(2) symmetry.

*Ryan Flynn,Anders W. Sandvik*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper uses Monte Carlo simulations of a bilayer Ising model to demonstrate that moiré-modulated magnetic textures emerge through a smooth energy-balance-driven crossover rather than a novel phase transition, preserving conventional Ising universality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how moiré patterns from twist or strain in magnetic bilayers create spatially modulated magnetic textures and whether this involves new universality classes or symmetry breaking.

Method: Large-scale classical Monte Carlo simulations of a minimal bilayer Ising model with moiré-modulated interlayer coupling.

Result: The ordering transition remains in the conventional 2D Ising universality class; a smooth crossover exists between uniform ferromagnet and domain-textured states at low temperatures; no layer symmetry breaking occurs in twisted bilayers; crossover location follows simple energy balance between interlayer exchange and domain-wall costs.

Conclusion: Moiré magnetic textures emerge from geometric energetics without requiring a thermodynamic phase transition, providing a minimal framework for understanding these systems.

Abstract: Moiré patterns in magnetic bilayers generate spatially modulated interlayer exchange interactions that can give rise to nonuniform magnetic textures. We study a minimal classical bilayer Ising model with a moiré-modulated interlayer coupling, generated either by relative twist or differential strain between the layers. Using large-scale classical Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the ordering transition remains in the conventional two-dimensional Ising universality class, even when the low-temperature state is domain-textured. At low temperatures, we find a smooth crossover between a uniform ferromagnet and domain-textured state, in which the spins locally follow the sign of the interlayer exchange. We demonstrate that there is no breaking of layer symmetry for twisted bilayers. The location of the crossover is determined by a simple geometric energy balance between bulk interlayer exchange and intralayer domain-wall costs. Our results provide a minimal framework for understanding how moiré-modulated magnetic textures can emerge from geometric energetics without requiring a thermodynamic phase transition.

### [169] [Accelerating Multicanonical Sampling with Irreversibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18980)
*Thomas Vogel,Ying Wai Li*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper enhances flat-histogram Monte Carlo methods by incorporating irreversibility via the lifting approach, significantly accelerating ground-state searches in complex systems like the 2D Ising model and Edwards-Anderson spin glass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flat-histogram Monte Carlo methods suffer from slow convergence due to diffusive random walks, especially when approaching the end of simulations, limiting their efficiency in finding ground states or studying phase transitions in complex systems.

Method: The authors apply irreversibility to the multicanonical Monte Carlo method using the lifting approach, which modifies the Markov chain dynamics to break reversibility and avoid diffusive slowdown.

Result: The irreversible method achieves a 2-4 times speedup for ground-state search in a 2D Ising model and up to an order of magnitude speedup for an Edwards-Anderson spin glass. Round-trip times between ground states show a narrower distribution and are significantly shorter than in reversible methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating irreversibility via lifting effectively reduces convergence time and variance in flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations, making ground-state searches in complex physical systems substantially faster and more reliable.

Abstract: Flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations are well-established, robust methods to perform random walks in a physical observable or parameter space, making them suitable for finding ground states or studying phase transitions in complex systems in statistical physics. However, their efficiency can be limited by the time to attain the desired flat distribution, which is generally unknown prior to the simulations. In particular, they might suffer from slowing down towards the end of a simulation due to the diffusive nature of random walks. In this work we apply irreversibility to the multicanonical Monte Carlo method via the lifting approach to alleviate this behavior. We achieve a 2-4 times speedup in ground-state search for a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model, and up to an order of magnitude of speedup for finding the ground-state energy in an Edwards-Anderson spin glass, compared to traditional multicanonical sampling. The round-trip times between ground states show a narrower distribution and are significantly shorter compared to the reversible counterpart, suggesting that a lower convergence time with a smaller time variance is feasible.

TL;DR: 提出新计算方法，为三维自旋玻璃中的de Almeida-Thouless相变提供直接数值证据，支持复本对称破缺理论


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 磁场中自旋玻璃态的本质是统计物理的重要未解问题，特别是三维自旋玻璃中de Almeida-Thouless(dAT)相变的存在性仍存在争议

Method: 提出一种新的自旋玻璃磁化率计算方法，该方法对重叠分布的宽尾不敏感；将方法应用于二维和三维Edwards-Anderson自旋玻璃模型，并与无无序的三维Ising模型以及平均场自旋玻璃模型进行对比

Result: 发现明显差异：Ising和二维自旋玻璃的磁化率最大值在磁场-温度平面上向右弯曲，表明超临界交叉线；而平均场和三维自旋玻璃则向左弯曲，是dAT线的特征。有限尺寸标度显示三维自旋玻璃在磁场下的峰值磁化率随系统尺寸发散，而二维情况下饱和

Conclusion: 这些结果为三维自旋玻璃中的dAT相变提供了直接数值证据，支持复本对称破缺机制

Abstract: The nature of spin-glass states in a magnetic field remains a major open problem in statistical physics. The existence of the de Almeida-Thouless (dAT) transition for three-dimensional (3D) spin glasses in a field is still debated. We introduce a new computational method to define the spin-glass susceptibility, which is robust against the broad tail in the overlap distribution that undermines conventional analyses. Applying this approach to the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model in 2D and 3D, and contrasting with the 3D Ising (without disorder) and mean-field spin-glass models, we find a stark difference: the locus of susceptibility maxima bends to the right in the field-temperature plane for the Ising and 2D spin-glass cases, indicating a supercritical crossover line, but bends to the left for the mean-field and 3D spin glasses - a signature of the dAT line. Finite-size scaling further suggests that the peak susceptibility diverges with system size in 3D spin glasses under a field, while saturating in 2D. These results provide direct numerical evidence for the dAT transition in 3D, supporting the replica symmetry breaking scenario.

Conclusion: 动态无序显著改变了崎岖能量景观上的输运性质，理论成功连接了扩散行为的两个极端机制

Abstract: Established theoretical studies of diffusion in rugged (or rough) potential surfaces have largely focused on quenched energy landscapes. Here we study diffusion on a rugged energy landscape in the presence of dynamic disorder, a situation relevant to a wide range of disordered systems, including glasses, disordered solids, and biomolecular transport. For static (quenched) Gaussian disorder, Zwanzig derived a compact mean field expression for the diffusion constant, showing that increasing ruggedness leads to a sharp reduction of diffusive transport. Subsequent work demonstrated that in one-dimensional discrete lattices diffusion is further suppressed by rare but long-lived multi-site traps that lie beyond the mean-field description. In many physical systems, however, the local energy landscape is not frozen but fluctuates in time, there by modifying trap lifetimes and transport properties. In this work we develop a minimal, analytically tractable theory of diffusion on rugged energy landscapes with dynamic disorder by allowing site or barrier energies to fluctuate as dichotomic (telegraph) processes with given amplitude and flipping rate. Using a Kehr type formulation appropriate for discrete hopping processes, we derive an analytic expression for the diffusion constant in terms of mean waiting times. We show that dynamic disorder induces a continuous crossover from quasi-quenched, trap-dominated transport to an annealed, motional narrowing regime as the fluctuation rate increases. Explicit numerical calculations confirm this crossover, interpolating between rare-event-dominated diffusion and Zwanzig mean-field regime.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice, featuring first- and second-neighbor ferromagnetic couplings ($J_1>0$ and $J_2>0$) and third-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions ($J_3<0$). Using the cluster mean-field method, we analyze the phase transitions in the regime $1/2 < J_2/J_1 \le 1$, where ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases compete. Our results reveal that near the strongly frustrated limit $J_3/J_1 = -1$, the system exhibits order-by-disorder state selection, tricritical and bicritical behavior, critical endpoints, and two successive phase transitions. The ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition remains second order across the entire interaction range, whereas the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic boundary shows a richer behavior, including both first- and second-order transitions as well as tricriticality. Increasing the second-neighbor coupling $J_2/J_1$ narrows the range of $J_3/J_1$ where first-order antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions occur; beyond a certain threshold, only second-order order-disorder transitions persist. Consequently, the tricritical point shifts toward $J_3/J_1 \approx -1$ as $J_2/J_1$ increases, culminating in a bicritical point where the antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and paramagnetic phases meet.

### [173] [Anomalous transport in non-integrable classical field theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19894)
*Matija Koterle,Tomaz Prosen,Tianci Zhou*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Finite temperature regulates anomalous KPZ spin transport in continuum field theories, enabling superdiffusion at low temperatures (with ballistic energy transport) that transitions to diffusion at high temperatures, even in non-integrable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalous Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) spin transport is established in integrable lattice models but unexplored in continuum field theories due to numerical discretization breaking integrability.

Method: Numerically studied a family of spin field theories (labeled by integer n); used Lyapunov analysis to confirm non-integrability; examined spin-density space-time profiles at varying temperatures.

Result: - n=1 (Landau-Lifshitz model): Shows spin superdiffusion with KPZ scaling and ballistic energy transport at low temperature; both become diffusive at high temperature. - n=2 (non-integrable): Exhibits identical low-to-high temperature crossover. Long-lived soliton-like trajectories observed at low temperature despite non-integrability.

Conclusion: Finite temperature acts as a regulator restoring anomalous transport in continuum theories. The universal low-temperature KPZ behavior across integrable (n=1) and non-integrable (n=2) cases suggests soliton-like dynamics underpin the crossover, bridging lattice and continuum theory observations.

Abstract: Anomalous KPZ spin transport is well established in integrable non-Abelian lattice models but has not been investigated in continuum field theories as discretization in numerics generally break the continuum theory's integrability. We show that finite temperature acts as a regulator that can restore anomalous transport over a broad time window. In a family of spin field theories labeled by integer $n$, the $n = 1$ case is the Landau-Lifshitz model, whose numerical data shows spin superdiffusion with Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling and, at lower temperature ballistic energy transport, whereas both observables are diffusive at high temperature. The non-integrable $n = 2$ case shows the same crossover. While Lyapunov analysis confirms the model's non-integrability, the structure of spin-density space-time profiles suggests that long-lived soliton-like trajectories exist at low temperature.
