Despite the absence of interactions, the dynamics generates a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) with long-range correlations. We obtain exact results, both for the NESS and for the time dependence of the correlations, which are valid for arbitrary $m$ and $N$. By varying $m$, the system interpolates between an uncorrelated regime ($m=1$) and the fully synchronous resetting case ($m=N$). For all $1<m<N$, correlations exhibit a non-monotonic time dependence due to the emergence of an intrinsic decorrelation mechanism. In the stationary state, the correlation strength can be tuned by varying $m$, and it displays a transition at a critical value $N_c=6$. Our predictions extend straightforwardly to any spatial dimension $d$ and the critical value $N_c=6$ remains the same in all dimensions. Our predictions are testable in existing experimental setups on optically trapped colloidal particles."}

In this context, the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) framework based on Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) has witnessed rapid development, establishing itself as a vital approach for investigating strongly correlated two-dimensional systems. However, standard PEPS-VMC algorithms predominantly rely on sequential local updates. This conventional approach often suffers from slow convergence and critical slowing down, particularly in the vicinity of phase transitions or within frustrated landscapes. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient autoregressive row-wise sampling algorithm for PEPS that enables direct, rejection-free sampling via single-layer contractions. By utilizing autoregressive single-layer row updates to generate collective, non-local configuration proposals, our method significantly reduces temporal correlations compared to local Metropolis moves. We benchmark the algorithm on the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the quantum spin glass. Our results demonstrate that the row-wise scheme effectively mitigates critical slowing down near the Ising critical point. Furthermore, in the rugged landscape of the quantum spin glass, it yields improved optimization stability and lower ground-state energies. These findings indicate that single-layer autoregressive row updates provide a flexible and robust improvement to local PEPS-VMC sampling and may serve as a basis for more advanced sampling schemes."}

Rather than introducing explicit encoding or decoding mechanisms, information is viewed as emerging directly from the geometry and dynamics of stochastic transport through first-passage events. Treating the FHL as the primary observable, we characterize how geometry and drift jointly shape the induced boundary measure. In diffusion-dominated regimes, the exit law exhibits scale-free, heavy-tailed spatial fluctuations along the boundary, whereas a nonzero drift component introduces an intrinsic length scale that suppresses these tails and reorganizes the exit statistics. Within a generator-based formulation, the FHL arises naturally as a boundary measure induced by an elliptic operator, allowing explicit boundary kernels to be derived analytically in canonical geometries. Planar absorbing boundaries in different ambient dimensions are examined as benchmark cases, illustrating how directed transport regularizes diffusion-driven fluctuations and induces qualitative transitions in boundary statistics. Overall, the present work provides a unified structural framework for first-hitting location laws and highlights FHL statistics as natural probes of geometry, drift, and irreversibility in stochastic transport."}

Remarkably, we show that these hypergraph features have a fundamental effect on the critical properties of hypergraph percolation, reshaping criticality in a way that depends on network structure. Specifically, we derive anomalous critical exponents that depend on whether node or hyperedge percolation is considered in maximally correlated, heavy-tailed regimes. These theoretical predictions are validated on synthetic hypergraph models and on a real directed metabolic network, opening new perspectives for the characterization of the robustness and resilience of real-world directed, heterogeneous higher-order networks."}

Kirkpatrick and Belitz [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 124}, 147201 (2020)] have pointed out that one notable exception are non-centrosymmetric metals with a strong spin-orbit interaction. In such materials the spin-orbit interaction gives the relevant soft modes a mass, which inhibits the mechanism leading to a first-order transition. Miserev, Loss, and Klinovaja [Phys. Rev.

Here, we introduce a surface molecular qubit formed by pentacene molecules scaffolded on a two-dimensional (2D) material, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The qubit exhibits stable fluorescence and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) from cryogenic to ambient conditions. With fully deuterated pentacene, the Hahn-echo coherence reaches 22 $μ$s and further extends to 214 $μ$s under dynamical decoupling, outperforming state-of-the-art shallow NV centers in diamond, despite being positioned directly on the surface. We map the local spin environment, resolving couplings to nearby nuclear and electron spins that can serve as auxiliary quantum resources. This platform combines true surface integration, long qubit coherence, and scalable fabrication, opening routes to quantum sensing, quantum simulation, and hybrid quantum devices. It also paves the way for a broader family of 2D material-supported molecular qubits."}

In this work, we propose Gap-K%, a novel pretraining data detection method grounded in the optimization dynamics of LLM pretraining. By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations.

We focus our analysis on the behavior of the charge susceptibility and the current noise in the vicinity of the transition. Remarkably, despite the intrinsically non-equilibrium nature of the steady state, critical charge fluctuations admit an effective-temperature description, $T_{\\text{eff}}(T,V)$, that collapses the steady-state behavior onto its equilibrium form. In sharp contrast, current fluctuations exhibit genuinely non-equilibrium features: the fluctuation-dissipation ratio becomes negative in the ordered phase, corresponding to a negative effective temperature for the current degrees of freedom. These results establish current noise as a sensitive probe of critical fluctuations at non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions and open new directions for exploring voltage-driven critical phenomena in quantum transport systems."}

While the Shastry-Sutherland lattice permits additional symmetry-allowed fermion bilinears compared to the square lattice, the quantum field theories are identical up to additional irrelevant terms. Consequently, the Higgs potential structure and the leading low-energy theory coincide with the square-lattice case at the quantum critical point. The SO(5) critical point is expected to realize conformal deconfined criticality: we analyze it in a large flavor expansion, calculate its critical exponents, and identify the Yukawa coupling between the fermions and Higgs fields as the relevant perturbation that destabilizes it, consistent with pseudocritical behavior observed in recent Monte Carlo studies. We show that the emergent SO(5) order parameter acquires a large anomalous dimension at the critical point, leading to strongly enhanced Néel and VBS susceptibilities-a hallmark of fermionic deconfined quantum criticality consistent with numerical studies. Our results place recent numerical evidence for a gapless $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice within a controlled field-theoretic framework and demonstrate that fermionic deconfined criticality on the square lattice-including critical exponents and stability-extends to frustrated lattices with reduced symmetry."}

This paper tackles the data and model heterogeneity by explicitly addressing the parameter level varying evidential credence across local models. A novel aggregation approach is introduced that captures these parameter variations in local models and performs robust aggregation of neighbourhood local updates. Specifically, consensus weights are generated via approximation of second-order information of local models on their local datasets. These weights are utilized to scale neighbourhood updates before aggregating them into global neighbourhood representation. In extensive experiments with computer vision tasks, the proposed approach shows strong generalizability of local models at reduced communication costs."}

Image-level mixed sample data augmentations, such as CutMix and MixUp, are frequently used for training transformers, yet these techniques perturb patient-specific attributes, such as medical comorbidity and clinical factors, since they only account for images and labels. To address this limitation, we propose a hierarchical sampling strategy, Oculomix, for mixed sample augmentations. Our method is based on two clinical priors. First (exam level), images acquired from the same patient at the same time point share the same attributes. Second (patient level), images acquired from the same patient at different time points have a soft temporal trend, as morbidity generally increases over time. Guided by these priors, our method constrains the mixing space to the patient and exam levels to better preserve patient-specific characteristics and leverages their hierarchical relationships. The proposed method is validated using ViT models on a five-year prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a large ethnically diverse population (Alzeye).

We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements. We evaluate on (i) public PDDL3 preference/oversubscription benchmarks and (ii) RecipeNLG-Subs, a missing-substitute recipe-planning benchmark built from RecipeNLG with substitution candidates from Recipe1MSubs and FoodKG. FCP improves success and reduces hard-constraint violations on RecipeNLG-Subs compared to LLM-only and ReAct-style baselines, while remaining competitive with classical PDDL3 planners."}

For an unstructured search, Grover's algorithm predicts a quadratic speedup, with the search time $τ(N)=Θ(\\sqrt{N})$ and $N$ the database size. Numerical studies suggest that the time complexity can change in the presence of feedback, injecting information during the search. Here, we determine the time complexity of the quantum analog of a randomized algorithm, which implements feedback in a simple form. The search is a continuous-time quantum walk on a complete graph, where the target is continuously monitored by a detector. Additionally, the quantum state is reset if the detector does not click within a specified time interval. This yields a non-unitary, non-Markovian dynamics. We optimize the search time as a function of the hopping amplitude, detection rate, and resetting rate, and identify the conditions under which time complexity could outperform Grover's scaling. The overall search time does not violate Grover's optimality bound when including the time budget of the physical implementation of the measurement. For databases of finite sizes monitoring can warrant rapid convergence and provides a promising avenue for fault-tolerant quantum searches."}

In these architectures, each neuron is mapped to a dedicated hardware unit, making them well-suited for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. Previous unrolled implementations mostly focus on fully connected networks because of their simplicity, although it is well known that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require fewer computations for the same accuracy. When observing the data flow in CNNs, pooling layers and convolutional layers with a stride larger than one, the number of data at their output is reduced with respect to their input. This data reduction strongly affects the data rate in a fully parallel implementation, making hardware units heavily underutilized unless it is handled properly. This work addresses this issue by analyzing the data flow of CNNs and presents a novel approach to designing data-rate-aware, continuous-flow CNN architectures. The proposed approach ensures a high hardware utilization close to 100% by interleaving low data rate signals and sharing hardware units, as well as using the right parallelization to achieve the throughput of a fully parallel implementation. The results show that a significant amount of the arithmetic logic can be saved, which allows implementing complex CNNs like MobileNet on a single FPGA with high throughput."}

We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator.

Remarkably, we show that these hypergraph features have a fundamental effect on the critical properties of hypergraph percolation, reshaping criticality in a way that depends on network structure. Specifically, we derive anomalous critical exponents that depend on whether node or hyperedge percolation is considered in maximally correlated, heavy-tailed regimes. These theoretical predictions are validated on synthetic hypergraph models and on a real directed metabolic network, opening new perspectives for the characterization of the robustness and resilience of real-world directed, heterogeneous higher-order networks."}

Diamond is an especially attractive material for quantum devices because it can host atomic-scale defects that emit single photons and store quantum information with exceptional stability. However, fabricating the optical structures needed to control light in diamond typically relies on slow, bespoke processes that are difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce a manufacturing approach that brings diamond quantum photonics closer to industrial production. Instead of sequentially defining each device by lithography written directly on diamond, we fabricate high-precision silicon masks using commercial semiconductor foundries and transfer them onto diamond via microtransfer printing. These masks define large arrays of nanoscale optical structures, shifting the most demanding pattern-definition steps away from the diamond substrate, improving uniformity, yield, and throughput. Using this method, we demonstrate hundreds of diamond \"quantum microchiplets\" with improved optical performance and controlled interaction with quantum emitters. The chiplet format allows defective devices to be replaced and enables integration with existing photonic and electronic circuits. Our results show that high-quality diamond quantum devices can be produced using scalable, foundry-compatible techniques. This approach provides a practical pathway toward large-scale quantum photonic systems and hybrid quantum-classical technologies built on established semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure."}

We focus our analysis on the behavior of the charge susceptibility and the current noise in the vicinity of the transition. Remarkably, despite the intrinsically non-equilibrium nature of the steady state, critical charge fluctuations admit an effective-temperature description, $T_{\\text{eff}}(T,V)$, that collapses the steady-state behavior onto its equilibrium form. In sharp contrast, current fluctuations exhibit genuinely non-equilibrium features: the fluctuation-dissipation ratio becomes negative in the ordered phase, corresponding to a negative effective temperature for the current degrees of freedom. These results establish current noise as a sensitive probe of critical fluctuations at non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions and open new directions for exploring voltage-driven critical phenomena in quantum transport systems."}

Multi-angle QAOA (MA-QAOA), which assigns independent parameters to each Hamiltonian operator term, achieves superior approximation performance even with fewer layers than standard QAOA. Unfortunately, this increased expressibility can raise the classical computational cost due to a greater number of parameters. The recently proposed Layerwise MA-QAOA (LMA-QAOA) reduces this overhead by training one layer at a time, but it may suffer from obtaining the precise solution due to the previously fixed parameters. This work addresses two questions for efficient MA-QAOA training: (i) What is the optimal granularity for parameter updates per epoch, and (ii) How can we get precise final cost function results while only partially updating the parameters per epoch? Despite the benefit of reducing the parameters that update per epoch can reduce the classical computation overhead, too fine or coarse a granularity of Hamiltonian update can degrade the MA-QAOA training efficiency. We find that optimizing one complete layer per epoch is an efficient granularity. Moreover, selectively retraining each layer by tracking gradient variations can achieve a final cost function equivalent to the standard MA-QAOA while lowering the parameter update overhead. Based on these insights, we propose Orbit-QAOA, which cyclically revisits layers and selectively freezes stabilized parameters. Across diverse graph benchmarks, Orbit-QAOA reduces training steps by up to 81.8%, reduces approximation ratio error by up to 72x compared to the unified stop condition-applied enhanced LMA-QAOA, and achieves equivalent approximation performance compared to the standard MA-QAOA."}

In face of the growing demand for complex multi-modal data analysis in urban park development monitoring, these methods often fail to provide flexible analysis capabilities for diverse application scenarios. This study proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework, which aims to make full use of the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM to meet the challenges in urban park development monitoring. In this framework, a general horizontal and vertical data alignment mechanism is designed to ensure the consistency and effective tracking of multi-modal data. At the same time, a specific toolkit is constructed to alleviate the hallucination issues of LLM due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. Compared to vanilla GPT-4o and other agents, our approach enables robust multi-modal information fusion and analysis, offering reliable and scalable solutions tailored to the diverse and evolving demands of urban park development monitoring."}

Five calibrators; Isotonic regression, Platt scaling, Beta calibration, Venn-Abers predictors, and Pearsonify are trained on a separate calibration split and applied to test predictions. Calibration is evaluated using proper scoring rules (log-loss and Brier score) and diagnostic measures (Spiegelhalter's Z, ECE, and ECI), alongside discrimination (AUC-ROC) and standard classification metrics. Across tasks and architectures, Venn-Abers predictors achieve the largest average reductions in log-loss, followed closely by Beta calibration, while Platt scaling exhibits weaker and less consistent effects. Beta calibration improves log-loss most frequently across tasks, whereas Venn-Abers displays fewer instances of extreme degradation and slightly more instances of extreme improvement. Importantly, we find that commonly used calibration procedures, most notably Platt scaling and isotonic regression, can systematically degrade proper scoring performance for strong modern tabular models.

In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that carefully simulated label noise synergistically enhances both the generalization performance and robustness of label noises. Consequently, we propose Noise-Compensated Sharpness-aware Minimization (NCSAM) to leverage the perturbation of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to remedy the damage of label noises.

To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration. First, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) activates the model's latent evaluation ability via curriculum learning, producing a high-fidelity endogenous reward signal. Second, Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) leverages this signal to optimize the generative reasoning policy. Experiments show that SEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in evaluation accuracy, reprompting efficiency, and generation quality, without sacrificing general multimodal capabilities."}

Collective excitations play a vital role in shaping our understanding of these exotic quantum phases of matter and their quantum phase transitions. While the magneto-roton and long-wavelength chiral graviton modes in the FQH liquids have been extensively explored, the collective excitations of CSLs remain elusive. Here we explore the collective excitations in the SU(2) symmetric CSL phase of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1-J_2-J_χ$ model, where an intriguing quantum phase diagram was recently revealed. Combining exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle calculations, we observe two spin-singlet collective modes: a chiral p-wave (low-energy) roton mode at finite momentum and a d-wave (higher-energy) nematic mode at zero momentum, both of which are prominent across the CSL phase. Such exotic modes exhibit fingerprints distinct from those of FQH liquids, and to the best of our knowledge, are reported for the first time. By tuning $J_2$, we find the nematic mode to be pronouncedly soft, together with the spin-triplet two-spinon bound states, potentially promoting strong nematic and spin stripe instabilities. Our work paves the way for further understanding CSL from the dynamical perspective and provides new spectroscopic signatures for future experiments of CSL candidates."}

Our approach uses ensembles of noisy QSP circuits combined with measurement-level averaging to suppress random phase errors in Z rotations. Building on this framework, we develop robust QSP algorithms for implementing polynomial functions of Hermitian matrices and for estimating observables, with applications to Hamiltonian simulation, quantum linear systems, and ground-state preparation.

In this work, we overcome these challenges and report single-crystal diffuse neutron scattering from hydrothermally grown Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ -- the highest quality crystals obtained to date for the Ce$_2$X$_2$O$_7$ family. In contrast to the broad diffuse scattering observed in Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, we find highly structured diffuse scattering from Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ featuring strong intensities along the Brillouin zone boundaries.

For states on $\\mathbb{C}^{d_A \\times d_A} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d_B \\times d_B}$, we strengthen this existence result by constructing an $O(d_A^2 d_B^2)$-time algorithm that specifies such a perfect one-way LOCC protocol.

MeanCache introduces an average-velocity perspective: by leveraging cached Jacobian--vector products (JVP) to construct interval average velocities from instantaneous velocities, it effectively mitigates local error accumulation. To further improve cache timing and JVP reuse stability, we develop a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy as a practical tool, employing a Peak-Suppressed Shortest Path under budget constraints to determine the schedule. Experiments on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that MeanCache achieves 4.12X and 4.56X and 3.59X acceleration, respectively, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art caching baselines in generation quality.

Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency."}

Here, we address the interplay between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting states observed in tWSe$_2$ when the Fermi level is close to its $M$-point van Hove singularity and the displacement field is small. We combine DFT with path-integrals to construct a minimal moiré band model that accounts for lattice relaxation along the $c$-axis and perform Hartree-Fock calculations to identify competing charge and spin ordered states. For tWSe$_2$ at $θ=2.7^\\circ$ and $θ=3.65^\\circ$, we find that a layer antiferromagnet (AFM), a stripe spin-density-wave (SDW), and the ferromagnetic Chern insulator (FM) are the primary candidates for the ground state at zero displacement field, and argue that antiferromagnetic spin interactions on the next neighbor bond $J_2$ can induce a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral superconducting state."}

This issue is further exacerbated in practice, as retraining or adapting decoders becomes particularly challenging when only limited data are available from a new session. To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data."}

We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors.

The two cascaded delays from click to conversion and from conversion to refund have opposite effects, making traditional CVR modeling methods inapplicable. Moreover, the lack of open-source datasets and online continuous training schemes further hinders progress in this area.To address these challenges, we introduce CASCADE (Cascaded Sequences of Conversion and Delayed Refund), the first large-scale open dataset derived from the Taobao app for online continuous NetCVR prediction.

To mitigate this issue, unlearnable examples introduce imperceptible perturbations into data, preventing models from learning effectively. However, existing methods typically rely on deep neural networks as surrogate models for perturbation generation, resulting in significant computational costs. In this work, we propose Perturbation-Induced Linearization (PIL), a computationally efficient yet effective method that generates perturbations using only linear surrogate models. PIL achieves comparable or better performance than existing surrogate-based methods while reducing computational time dramatically. We further reveal a key mechanism underlying unlearnable examples: inducing linearization to deep models, which explains why PIL can achieve competitive results in a very short time. Beyond this, we provide an analysis about the property of unlearnable examples under percentage-based partial perturbation. Our work not only provides a practical approach for data protection but also offers insights into what makes unlearnable examples effective."}

For instance, the work we need to invest in order to implement $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of a quantum channel is quantified by the thermodynamic capacity of the channel when we require the implementation's accuracy to be guaranteed in diamond norm over the $n$-system input. Recent work showed that work extraction can be implemented universally, meaning the same implementation works for a large class of input states, while achieving a variable work cost that is optimal for each individual i.i.d. input state. Here, we revisit some techniques leading to derivation of the thermodynamic capacity, and leverage them to construct a thermodynamic implementation of $n$ i.i.d. copies of any time-covariant quantum channel, up to some process decoherence that is necessary because the implementation reveals the amount of consumed work. The protocol uses so-called thermal operations and achieves the optimal per-input work cost for any i.i.d. input state; it relies on the conditional erasure protocol in our earlier work, adjusted to yield variable work. We discuss the effect of the work-cost decoherence. While it can significantly corrupt the correlations between the output state and any reference system, we show that for any time-covariant i.i.d. input state, the state on the output system faithfully reproduces that of the desired process to be implemented. As an immediate consequence of our results, we recover recent results for optimal work extraction from i.i.d. states up to the error scaling and implementation specifics, and propose an optimal preparation protocol for time-covariant i.i.d. states."}

We model normal support embeddings with a Normal-Inverse-Wishart (NIW) prior, producing a Student-$t$ predictive distribution that enables uncertainty-aware, heavy-tailed anomaly scoring and is essential for robustness in extreme few-shot settings. We further extend BayPrAnoMeta to a federated meta-learning framework with supervised contrastive regularization for heterogeneous industrial clients and prove convergence to stationary points of the resulting nonconvex objective. Experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark demonstrate consistent and significant AUROC improvements over MAML, Proto-MAML, and PatchCore-based methods in few-shot anomaly detection settings."}

While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making."}

We reconsider contextuality from an information-theoretic perspective, focusing on operational models constrained to maintain a single internal state with fixed semantics across multiple contexts. Under this constraint, we show that contextual statistics certify an unavoidable obstruction to classical probabilistic descriptions. Specifically, any classical model that reproduces such statistics must either embed contextual dependence into the internal state or introduce additional external labels carrying nonzero information. This result identifies contextuality as a witness of irreducible information cost in classical representations, rather than as a purely nonclassical anomaly. From this viewpoint, quantum probability emerges as a canonical framework that accommodates contextual operations without requiring explicit contextual encoding."}

Based on this ansatz, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become a popular method for decomposing embeddings into a sparse combination of linear directions, which have been shown empirically to often correspond to human-interpretable semantics. However, recent attempts to apply SAEs to multimodal embedding spaces (such as the popular CLIP embeddings for image/text data) have found that SAEs often learn \"split dictionaries\", where most of the learned sparse features are essentially unimodal, active only for data of a single modality. In this work, we study how to effectively adapt SAEs for the setting of multimodal embeddings while ensuring multimodal alignment. We first argue that the existence of a split dictionary decomposition on an aligned embedding space implies the existence of a non-split dictionary with improved modality alignment. Then, we propose a new SAE-based approach to multimodal embedding decomposition using cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization. We apply our method to popular embeddings for image/text (CLIP) and audio/text (CLAP) data and show that, compared to standard SAEs, our approach learns a more multimodal dictionary while reducing the number of dead neurons and improving feature semanticity. We finally demonstrate how this improvement in alignment of concepts between modalities can enable improvements in the interpretability and control of cross-modal tasks."}

This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes."}

We identify dephasing as the primary mechanism enforcing this symmetry, which can be suppressed by intercomponent phase correlations. Consequently, a sufficient condition for realizing a continuous time crystal is a nonlinear quantum self-sustaining system exhibiting quantum synchronization among its constituents. As a concrete example, we demonstrate spontaneous oscillations in a synchronized array of van der Pol oscillators, corroborated by both semiclassical dynamics and the quantum Liouville spectrum. These results reduce the identification of time crystals in many-body systems to the evaluation of only two-body correlations and provide a framework for classifying uncorrelated time crystals as trivial."}

StructuralCFN explicitly models each feature as a mathematical composition of its counterparts through Differentiable Adaptive Gating, which automatically discovers the optimal activation physics (e.g., attention-style filtering vs. inhibitory polarity) for each relationship. Our framework enables Structured Knowledge Integration, allowing domain-specific relational priors to be injected directly into the architecture to guide discovery. We evaluate StructuralCFN across a rigorous 10-fold cross-validation suite on 18 benchmarks, demonstrating statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) on scientific and clinical datasets (e.g., Blood Transfusion, Ozone, WDBC). Furthermore, StructuralCFN provides Intrinsic Symbolic Interpretability: it recovers the governing \"laws\" of the data manifold as human-readable mathematical expressions while maintaining a compact parameter footprint (300--2,500 parameters) that is over an order of magnitude (10x--20x) smaller than standard deep baselines."}

While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments. TONEL employs a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware constraints, enabling accurate retrieval under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on personalization benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our methods relative to strong baselines, especially in task-specific noisy scenarios."}

Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.\n  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of \"VCW as transitional framework.\" Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.\n  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes.

However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data.

To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants.

We found a secondary splitting of Autler-Townes splitting in the probing field transmission spectra, which could be understood by the effective Hamiltonian derived with multi-mode Floquet theory. The Frequency mixing scheme developed here enables continuous tunablity of the resonant frequency between upper levels, which facilitates the broad band sensing of AC field. Furthermore, by introducing an additional periodic driving, we realize an effective model that two distinct quantum interference effects coexist: interference among Floquet channels and loop interference arising from closed coherent pathways. Both interference effects could be read out from the transmission spectra independently. The changing of the distance between double splitting peaks represents the interference of Floquet channels, while their asymmetric linewidth broadening is linked with the total effective phase of the loop. This not only provides complementary readout for extracting the phase of AC field, but also establishes a new paradigm for coherent control in multi-level quantum systems."}

We refer to this approach as Distributional Sobolev Training. Inspired by Stochastic Value Gradients (SVG), our method utilizes a one-step world model of reward and transition distributions implemented via a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE). The proposed framework is sample-based and employs Max-sliced Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MSMMD) to instantiate the distributional Bellman operator. We prove that the Sobolev-augmented Bellman operator is a contraction with a unique fixed point, and highlight a fundamental smoothness trade-off underlying contraction in gradient-aware RL. To validate our method, we first showcase its effectiveness on a simple stochastic reinforcement learning toy problem, then benchmark its performance on several MuJoCo environments."}

However, the number of qubits available on a single quantum processing unit (QPU) is limited -- motivating the distributed preparation of such states across multiple QPUs as a practical approach to scalability. In this article, we investigate the distributed preparation of $n$-qubit $k$-excitation Dicke states $D(n,k)$ across a general number $p$ of QPUs, presenting a distributed quantum circuit (each QPU hosting approximately $\\lceil n/p \\rceil$ qubits) that prepares the state with communication complexity $O(p \\log k)$, circuit size $O(nk)$, and circuit depth $O\\left(p^2 k + \\log k \\log (n/k)\\right)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction to simultaneously achieve logarithmic communication complexity and polynomial circuit size and depth. We also establish a lower bound on the communication complexity of $p$-QPU distributed state preparation for a general target state. This lower bound is formulated in terms of the canonical polyadic rank (CP-rank) of a tensor associated with the target state. For the special case $p = 2$, we explicitly compute the CP-rank corresponding to the Dicke state $D(n,k)$ and derive a lower bound of $\\lceil\\log (k + 1)\\rceil$, which shows that the communication complexity of our construction matches this fundamental limit."}

In prior work, we developed a design optimization framework that incorporates techno-economic considerations through surrogate modeling and reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization, focusing solely on minimizing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by using a bottom-up cost estimation approach. In this study, we extend that framework to a multi-objective optimization that uses the Pareto Envelope Augmented with Reinforcement Learning (PEARL) algorithm. The objectives include minimizing both the rod-integrated peaking factor ($F_{Δh}$) and LCOE -- subject to safety and operational constraints. We evaluate three cost scenarios: (1) a high-cost axial and drum reflectors, (2) a low-cost axial reflector, and (3) low-cost axial and drum reflectors. Our findings indicate that reducing the solid moderator radius, pin pitch, and drum coating angle -- all while increasing the fuel height -- effectively lowers $F_{Δh}$. Across all three scenarios, four key strategies consistently emerged for optimizing LCOE: (1) minimizing the axial reflector contribution when costly, (2) reducing control drum reliance, (3) substituting expensive tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel with axial reflector material priced at the level of graphite, and (4) maximizing fuel burnup. While PEARL demonstrates promise in navigating trade-offs across diverse design scenarios, discrepancies between surrogate model predictions and full-order simulations remain.

Although this compositional paradigm has shown superior performance in domains such as reasoning, planning, and verification, its deployment remains challenging due to severe inefficiencies in symbolic and probabilistic inference. Through systematic analysis of representative neuro-symbolic workloads, we identify probabilistic logical reasoning as the inefficiency bottleneck, characterized by irregular control flow, low arithmetic intensity, uncoalesced memory accesses, and poor hardware utilization on CPUs and GPUs.\n  This paper presents REASON, an integrated acceleration framework for probabilistic logical reasoning in neuro-symbolic AI. REASON introduces a unified directed acyclic graph representation that captures common structure across symbolic and probabilistic models, coupled with adaptive pruning and regularization. At the architecture level, REASON features a reconfigurable, tree-based processing fabric optimized for irregular traversal, symbolic deduction, and probabilistic aggregation. At the system level, REASON is tightly integrated with GPU streaming multiprocessors through a programmable interface and multi-level pipeline that efficiently orchestrates compositional execution. Evaluated across six neuro-symbolic workloads, REASON achieves 12-50x speedup and 310-681x energy efficiency over desktop and edge GPUs under TSMC 28 nm node. REASON enables real-time probabilistic logical reasoning, completing end-to-end tasks in 0.8 s with 6 mm2 area and 2.12 W power, demonstrating that targeted acceleration of probabilistic logical reasoning is critical for practical and scalable neuro-symbolic AI and positioning REASON as a foundational system architecture for next-generation cognitive intelligence."}

Network nonlocality sharing is witnessed when the quantum values of the network correlations associated with relevant parties simultaneously violate a star-network Bell inequality generated from the given class of bipartite Bell inequalities. We streamline the calculation of the quantum values of the network correlations and derive an analytical expression for the bipartite quantum correlator, valid for arbitrary measurement settings and weak-measurement strengths.

While applying distillation to quantized models is not a new idea, we observe key advantages of QAD for today's LLMs: 1.

In this work, we propose MemCtrl, a novel framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pruning memory online. MemCtrl augments MLLMs with a trainable memory head μthat acts as a gate to determine which observations or reflections to retain, update, or discard during exploration. We evaluate with training two types of μ, 1) via an offline expert, and 2) via online RL, and observe significant improvement in overall embodied task completion ability on μ-augmented MLLMs. In particular, on augmenting two low performing MLLMs with MemCtrl on multiple subsets of the EmbodiedBench benchmark, we observe that μ-augmented MLLMs show an improvement of around 16% on average, with over 20% on specific instruction subsets. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis on the memory fragments collected by μ, noting the superior performance of μaugmented MLLMs on long and complex instruction types."}

We estimate the prevalence of different forms of error such as coherent error and control qubit leakage, then apply error suppression strategies based on the most significant sources of error, making use of pulse-shaping and additional compensating gates. These techniques require no additional hardware overhead and little additional calibration, making them suitable for routine adoption. An average reduction of 3.7x in error rate for two qubit operations is shown across a chain of 16 qubits, with the median error rate improving from 4.6$\\%$ to 1.2$\\%$ as measured by interleaved randomized benchmarking.

Inspired by this, we explore training an autoregressive transformer for in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). In this setting, we initially train a transformer on an offline dataset consisting of trajectories collected from various RL tasks, and then fix and use this transformer to create an action policy for new RL tasks. Notably, we consider the setting where the offline dataset contains trajectories sampled from suboptimal behavioral policies. In this case, standard autoregressive training corresponds to imitation learning and results in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Decision Importance Transformer(DIT) framework, which emulates the actor-critic algorithm in an in-context manner. In particular, we first train a transformer-based value function that estimates the advantage functions of the behavior policies that collected the suboptimal trajectories. Then we train a transformer-based policy via a weighted maximum likelihood estimation loss, where the weights are constructed based on the trained value function to steer the suboptimal policies to the optimal ones. We conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of DIT on both bandit and Markov Decision Process problems. Our results show that DIT achieves superior performance, particularly when the offline dataset contains suboptimal historical data."}

This dynamic adaptation contrasts with parallel approaches, which often suffer from siloed knowledge. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further enhances search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM candidates with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized to curate a comprehensive final research response. The process concludes with One Shot Report Generation, ensuring the final document is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density.

The energy spectra and eigenstate distributions of the system's Hamiltonian near the boundary of the phase transition exhibit different behaviors when the Hermiticity, non-Hermiticity and mosaic modulation of the quasi-periodic potential are considered, respectively. The existence of the mobility ring is revealed in the non-Hermitian SSH chain by studying of the critical behaviors near the boundary.

Fortunately, there are strong reasons to doubt that wave mechanics can describe the center of mass of systems at or above the Planck scale, thereby jeopardizing the construction of the corresponding Fock space. As a result, systems with masses exceeding the Planck mass would have their center of mass described through classical mechanics, regardless of being able to harbor macroscopic quantum phenomena as observed in the laboratory.

This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism.

However, variations in individual experiences and different levels of device interactions lead to data and model initialization heterogeneities across devices. Such heterogeneities leave variations in local model parameters across devices that leads to slower convergence. This paper tackles the data and model heterogeneity by explicitly addressing the parameter level varying evidential credence across local models. A novel aggregation approach is introduced that captures these parameter variations in local models and performs robust aggregation of neighbourhood local updates. Specifically, consensus weights are generated via approximation of second-order information of local models on their local datasets. These weights are utilized to scale neighbourhood updates before aggregating them into global neighbourhood representation. In extensive experiments with computer vision tasks, the proposed approach shows strong generalizability of local models at reduced communication costs."}

In these architectures, each neuron is mapped to a dedicated hardware unit, making them well-suited for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. Previous unrolled implementations mostly focus on fully connected networks because of their simplicity, although it is well known that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require fewer computations for the same accuracy. When observing the data flow in CNNs, pooling layers and convolutional layers with a stride larger than one, the number of data at their output is reduced with respect to their input. This data reduction strongly affects the data rate in a fully parallel implementation, making hardware units heavily underutilized unless it is handled properly. This work addresses this issue by analyzing the data flow of CNNs and presents a novel approach to designing data-rate-aware, continuous-flow CNN architectures. The proposed approach ensures a high hardware utilization close to 100% by interleaving low data rate signals and sharing hardware units, as well as using the right parallelization to achieve the throughput of a fully parallel implementation. The results show that a significant amount of the arithmetic logic can be saved, which allows implementing complex CNNs like MobileNet on a single FPGA with high throughput."}

For an unstructured search, Grover's algorithm predicts a quadratic speedup, with the search time $τ(N)=Θ(\\sqrt{N})$ and $N$ the database size. Numerical studies suggest that the time complexity can change in the presence of feedback, injecting information during the search. Here, we determine the time complexity of the quantum analog of a randomized algorithm, which implements feedback in a simple form. The search is a continuous-time quantum walk on a complete graph, where the target is continuously monitored by a detector. Additionally, the quantum state is reset if the detector does not click within a specified time interval. This yields a non-unitary, non-Markovian dynamics. We optimize the search time as a function of the hopping amplitude, detection rate, and resetting rate, and identify the conditions under which time complexity could outperform Grover's scaling. The overall search time does not violate Grover's optimality bound when including the time budget of the physical implementation of the measurement. For databases of finite sizes monitoring can warrant rapid convergence and provides a promising avenue for fault-tolerant quantum searches."}

We present a simulation-based study of temperature-dependent spectral dynamics and optical coherence in a mechanically decoupled quantum emitter in hBN. Employing a hybrid stochastic framework that combines Ornstein--Uhlenbeck detuning fluctuations with temperature-dependent, Gaussian-distributed discrete frequency jumps, motivated by experimentally observed spectral diffusion and blinking, we reproduce the measured evolution of inhomogeneous linewidth broadening and the progressive degradation of photon coherence across the relevant cryogenic range (5-30K). The model captures phonon-related spectral diffusion with a cubic temperature dependence and the onset of jump-like spectral instabilities at higher temperatures. By calibrating the hybrid diffusion, jump parameters to the experimentally measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the emission line and analyzing the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(τ)$ under resonant driving, we establish a unified phenomenological description that links stochastic detuning dynamics to the decay of optical coherence in a resonantly driven emitter. Analysis of $g^{(2)}(τ)$ under resonant driving reveals an additional dephasing rate $γ_{\\mathrm{sd+j}}$ that rises monotonically with temperature and drive strength, leading to a predicted critical crossover to overdamped dynamics at $T_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 25.91$~K.

PASS collapses ML constraints into pseudo-points and offers two selectors: a constraint-aware margin rule that collects near-boundary points and all detected CL violations, and an information-geometric rule that scores points via a Fisher-Rao distance derived from soft assignment posteriors, then selects the highest-information subset under a simple budget.

We propose much simpler techniques for assessing implicit planning in language models. With case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering, we demonstrate that our methodology easily scales to many models. Across models, we find that the generated rhyme (e.g. \"-ight\") or answer to a question (\"whale\") can be manipulated by steering at the end of the preceding line with a vector, affecting the generation of intermediate tokens leading up to the rhyme or answer word. We show that implicit planning is a universal mechanism, present in smaller models than previously thought, starting from 1B parameters.

MeanCache introduces an average-velocity perspective: by leveraging cached Jacobian--vector products (JVP) to construct interval average velocities from instantaneous velocities, it effectively mitigates local error accumulation. To further improve cache timing and JVP reuse stability, we develop a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy as a practical tool, employing a Peak-Suppressed Shortest Path under budget constraints to determine the schedule. Experiments on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that MeanCache achieves 4.12X and 4.56X and 3.59X acceleration, respectively, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art caching baselines in generation quality.

Starting from the quantisation of the electromagnetic field and the bosonic formalism of Fock space, the notes develop a unified framework for describing and analysing quantum states of light. Key families of states -- thermal, coherent, and squeezed -- are introduced as paradigmatic examples illustrating the transition from classical to nonclassical behaviour. The concepts of convexity, classicality, and quasiprobability representations are presented as complementary tools for characterising quantumness and defining operational notions such as P-nonclassicality. The discussion extends naturally to Gaussian states, composite systems, and continuous-variable entanglement, highlighting how nonclassicality serves as a resource for generating and quantifying quantum correlations.

However, this process lacks theoretical justification. This paper fills the gap by developing a local duality theory for such an SSVM formulation and exploring its relationship with the hinge-loss SVM (hSVM) and the ramp-loss SVM (rSVM). In particular, we prove that the derived SSVM is exactly the dual problem of the 0/1-loss SVM, and the linear representer theorem holds for their local solutions. The local solution of SSVM also provides guidelines on selecting hyperparameters of hSVM and rSVM. {Under specific conditions, we show that a sequence of global solutions of hSVM converges to a local solution of 0/1-loss SVM. Moreover, a local minimizer of 0/1-loss SVM is a local minimizer of rSVM.} This explains why a local solution induced by SSVM outperforms hSVM and rSVM in the prior empirical study. We further conduct numerical tests on real datasets and demonstrate potential advantages of SSVM by working with locally nice solutions proposed in this paper."}

To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data."}

We evaluate StructuralCFN across a rigorous 10-fold cross-validation suite on 18 benchmarks, demonstrating statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) on scientific and clinical datasets (e.g., Blood Transfusion, Ozone, WDBC). Furthermore, StructuralCFN provides Intrinsic Symbolic Interpretability: it recovers the governing \"laws\" of the data manifold as human-readable mathematical expressions while maintaining a compact parameter footprint (300--2,500 parameters) that is over an order of magnitude (10x--20x) smaller than standard deep baselines."}

It can alleviate bottlenecks associated with probing exciton dynamics spread across multiple spectral and temporal windows. We demonstrate that non-classical correlations of entangled photon pairs can be used to prepare narrowband two-exciton population distributions, circumventing transport in mediating states. The distributions thus created can be monitored using time-frequency-filtered photon coincidence counting, and the pathways contributing to photon emission events can be classified by tuning filtering parameters. Numerical simulations for a light-harvesting aggregate highlight the ability of this protocol to achieve selectivity by suppressing or amplifying specific pathways. Combining entangled photonic sources and multidimensional photon counting allow promising applications to spectroscopy and sensing."}

While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments.

This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism.

We propose much simpler techniques for assessing implicit planning in language models. With case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering, we demonstrate that our methodology easily scales to many models.

For the free particle, quantum fluctuations induce measurable phase shifts in azimuthal precession of approximately 8-12%, with uncertainty growth rates proportional to initial moment correlations. When a non-central Makarov potential is introduced, quantum corrections dramatically amplify its asymmetry. For strong coupling ($γ$ = -1.9), the quantum-corrected force drives trajectories preferentially toward the southern hemisphere on timescales 40% shorter than classical predictions, with trajectory densities exhibiting up to 3-fold enhancement in the preferred region. Throughout evolution, the solutions rigorously satisfy Heisenberg uncertainty relations, validating the truncation scheme. These results demonstrate that quantum effects fundamentally alter semiclassical dynamics in curved constrained systems, with direct implications for charge transport in carbon nanostructures, exciton dynamics in curved quantum wells, and reaction pathways in cyclic molecules."}

The construction uses hierarchical, self-simulating control elements based on the classical schemes from the seminal results of Gács (1986, 1989) together with a measurement-free concatenated code. We analyze the system under a local noise model and prove a noise threshold below which the logical errors are suppressed arbitrarily with increasing system size and the memory lifetime diverges in the thermodynamic limit.

Such methods aim to maximize a conditional output distribution aligned with higher rewards whilst not drifting far from a pretrained prior. This is commonly enforced by KL (Kullback Leibler) regularization. As such, a central issue still remains: how does one choose the right regularization strength? Too high of a strength leads to limited alignment and too low of a strength leads to \"reward hacking\". This renders the task of choosing the correct regularization strength highly non-trivial. Existing approaches sweep over this hyperparameter by aligning a pretrained model at multiple regularization strengths and then choose the best strength. Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive. We introduce DeRaDiff, a denoising time realignment procedure that, after aligning a pretrained model once, modulates the regularization strength during sampling to emulate models trained at other regularization strengths without any additional training or finetuning. Extending decoding-time realignment from language to diffusion models, DeRaDiff operates over iterative predictions of continuous latents by replacing the reverse step reference distribution by a geometric mixture of an aligned and reference posterior, thus giving rise to a closed form update under common schedulers and a single tunable parameter, lambda, for on the fly control. Our experiments show that across multiple text image alignment and image-quality metrics, our method consistently provides a strong approximation for models aligned entirely from scratch at different regularization strengths. Thus, our method yields an efficient way to search for the optimal strength, eliminating the need for expensive alignment sweeps and thereby substantially reducing computational costs."}

This approach enforces all physical constraints exactly, yielding a globally unconstrained variational formulation of the bosonic ground-state problem. The unconstrained structure also naturally supports solution reuse across nearby Hamiltonians: warm-starting from previously optimized covariance matrices substantially reduces the number of optimization steps required for convergence in families of related configurations, as encountered in crystal lattices, molecular systems, and fluids.

To this end, we present ProFlow, a proximal guidance framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling, defined as inferring solutions from sparse observations using a fixed generative prior without task-specific retraining. The algorithm employs a rigorous two-step scheme that alternates between: (\\romannumeral1) a terminal optimization step, which projects the flow prediction onto the intersection of the physically and observationally consistent sets via proximal minimization; and (\\romannumeral2) an interpolation step, which maps the refined state back to the generative trajectory to maintain consistency with the learned flow probability path. This procedure admits a Bayesian interpretation as a sequence of local maximum a posteriori (MAP) updates.

Our key insight is to activate adaptive branching exploration at critical decision points to probe promising trajectories, thereby achieving precise resource allocation that prioritizes sampling quality over blind coverage. This design leverages the agent's intrinsic decision-making signals to reduce dependence on human priors, enabling the agent to autonomously expand exploration and achieve stronger generalization. Experiments across diverse tasks (e.g., embodied planning), demonstrate that \\textsc{Spark} achieves superior success rates with significantly fewer training samples, exhibiting robust generalization even in unseen scenarios."}

We focus our analysis on the behavior of the charge susceptibility and the current noise in the vicinity of the transition.

The identity nests standard impossibility results as special cases, while also describing inherent tradeoffs when one or more fairness measures are not perfectly satisfied. The results suggest that accuracy and fairness are best viewed as complements in binary prediction tasks: increasing accuracy necessarily shrinks the total unfairness budget and vice-versa. Experiments on benchmark data confirm the theory and show that many fairness interventions largely substitute between fairness violations, and when they reduce accuracy they tend to expand the total unfairness budget. The results extend naturally to prediction tasks with non-binary outcomes, illustrating how additional outcome information can relax fairness incompatibilities and identifying conditions under which the binary-style impossibility does and does not extend to regression tasks."}

We show that a symmetry is compatible with stable MBL if and only if its action can be consistently represented within a quasi-local LIOM algebra, without enforcing extensive degeneracies or nonlocal operator mixing. This criterion sharply distinguishes symmetry classes: onsite Abelian symmetries are compatible with stable MBL and can host distinct symmetry-protected topological MBL phases, whereas continuous non-Abelian symmetries generically preclude stable MBL.

Consequently, there is a critical need for a sampling mechanism that can reconcile strict physical consistency and observational fidelity with the statistical structure of the pre-trained prior. To this end, we present ProFlow, a proximal guidance framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling, defined as inferring solutions from sparse observations using a fixed generative prior without task-specific retraining.

In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference."}

Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver. Although far less sample-efficient than classical solvers and discrete-geometry-aware diffusion methods, these experiments demonstrate that classic diffusion/flow formulations can assign non-zero probability mass to globally constrained combinatorial structures and can be used for constraint satisfaction via stochastic search."}

These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data.

Among the various XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations (CFs) hold a pivotal role due to their ability to illustrate how changes in input features can alter an ML model's decision, thereby offering actionable recourse to users. Ensuring that individuals with comparable attributes and those belonging to different protected groups (e.g., demographic) receive similar and actionable recourse options is essential for trustworthy and fair decision-making. In this work, we address this challenge directly by focusing on the generation of fair CFs. Specifically, we start by defining and formulating fairness at: 1) individual fairness, ensuring that similar individuals receive similar CFs, 2) group fairness, ensuring equitable CFs across different protected groups and 3) hybrid fairness, which accounts for both individual and broader group-level fairness. We formulate the problem as an optimization task and propose a novel model-agnostic, reinforcement learning based approach to generate CFs that satisfy fairness constraints at both the individual and group levels, two objectives that are usually treated as orthogonal. As fairness metrics, we extend existing metrics commonly used for auditing ML models, such as equal choice of recourse and equal effectiveness across individuals and groups. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, showing that it effectively ensures individual and group fairness while preserving the quality of the generated CFs in terms of proximity and plausibility, and quantify the cost of fairness in the different levels separately. Our work opens a broader discussion on hybrid fairness and its role and implications for XAI and beyond CFs."}

Despite recent advances in XAI have provided some insights, the specific role of attention layers in transformer based LLMs remains underexplored. This study investigates the memory mechanisms instantiated by attention layers, drawing on prior research in psychology and computational psycholinguistics that links Transformer attention to cue based retrieval in human memory. In this view, queries encode the retrieval context, keys index candidate memory traces, attention weights quantify cue trace similarity, and values carry the encoded content, jointly enabling the construction of a context representation that precedes and facilitates memory retrieval. Guided by the Encoding Specificity Principle, we hypothesize that the cues used in the initial stage of retrieval are instantiated as keywords. We provide converging evidence for this keywords-as-cues hypothesis. In addition, we isolate neurons within attention layers whose activations selectively encode and facilitate the retrieval of context-defining keywords. Consequently, these keywords can be extracted from identified neurons and further contribute to downstream applications such as unlearning."}

Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging."}

However, existing approaches require memory that scales with node degree, making them impractical when memory is limited. In this paper, we propose AsylADMM, a novel gossip algorithm for decentralized median and quantile estimation, primarily designed for asynchronous updates and requiring only two variables per node. We analyze a synchronous variant of AsylADMM to establish theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate fast convergence for the asynchronous algorithm. We then show that our algorithm enables quantile-based trimming, geometric median estimation, and depth-based trimming, with quantile-based trimming empirically outperforming existing rank-based methods.

In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference."}

Unlike the well-studied delayed feedback problem in CVR prediction, delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction remains unexplored and poses greater challenges, as GMV is a continuous target, and a single click can lead to multiple purchases that cumulatively form the label. To bridge the research gap, we establish TRACE, a GMV prediction benchmark containing complete transaction sequences rising from each user click, which supports delayed feedback modeling in an online streaming manner. Our analysis and exploratory experiments on TRACE reveal two key insights: (1) the rapid evolution of the GMV label distribution necessitates modeling delayed feedback under online streaming training; (2) the label distribution of repurchase samples substantially differs from that of single-purchase samples, highlighting the need for separate modeling. Motivated by these findings, we propose RepurchasE-Aware Dual-branch prEdictoR (READER), a novel GMV modeling paradigm that selectively activates expert parameters according to repurchase predictions produced by a router. Moreover, READER dynamically calibrates the regression target to mitigate under-estimation caused by incomplete labels. Experimental results show that READER yields superior performance on TRACE over baselines, achieving a 2.19% improvement in terms of accuracy. We believe that our study will open up a new avenue for studying online delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction, and our TRACE benchmark with the gathered insights will facilitate future research and application in this promising direction.

In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach.

Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines."}

A dual evaluation scheme has been proposed to assess both detection stability and physical alignment: Stability is measured using standard ranking metrics in which Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient captures rank agreement and Jaccard index captures the consistency of the top-K selected items; Physical alignment is assessed through correlations with established Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM). Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness: We show that the maximum residual aggregator achieves the highest physical alignment while maintaining stability.

To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model.

However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency."}

Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts."}

In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings.

We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems."}

Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables. This motivates a principled framework for concept extraction, namely Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), which aims to recover the log-posterior of each concept from LLM representations through a {unsupervised} linear unmixing process. We explore a specific variant, termed sparse ConCA, which leverages a sparsity prior to address the inherent ill-posedness of the unmixing problem. We implement 12 sparse ConCA variants and demonstrate their ability to extract meaningful concepts across multiple LLMs, offering theory-backed advantages over SAEs."}

Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the \"Big Two\" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for \"agency\" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for \"communion.\" This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance."}

Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level.

Among the various XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations (CFs) hold a pivotal role due to their ability to illustrate how changes in input features can alter an ML model's decision, thereby offering actionable recourse to users. Ensuring that individuals with comparable attributes and those belonging to different protected groups (e.g., demographic) receive similar and actionable recourse options is essential for trustworthy and fair decision-making. In this work, we address this challenge directly by focusing on the generation of fair CFs. Specifically, we start by defining and formulating fairness at: 1) individual fairness, ensuring that similar individuals receive similar CFs, 2) group fairness, ensuring equitable CFs across different protected groups and 3) hybrid fairness, which accounts for both individual and broader group-level fairness. We formulate the problem as an optimization task and propose a novel model-agnostic, reinforcement learning based approach to generate CFs that satisfy fairness constraints at both the individual and group levels, two objectives that are usually treated as orthogonal. As fairness metrics, we extend existing metrics commonly used for auditing ML models, such as equal choice of recourse and equal effectiveness across individuals and groups. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, showing that it effectively ensures individual and group fairness while preserving the quality of the generated CFs in terms of proximity and plausibility, and quantify the cost of fairness in the different levels separately. Our work opens a broader discussion on hybrid fairness and its role and implications for XAI and beyond CFs."}

In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of integrating Transformers into different components of a VAE. We conduct experiments on 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite and draw two main conclusions. First, results indicate that positioning Transformers to leverage latent and decoder representations leads to a trade-off between fidelity and diversity.

We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online.

On the Real World Knowledge Unlearning (RWKU) benchmark, PURGE achieves 11 percent unlearning effectiveness while preserving 98 percent of original utility. PURGE shows that framing LLM unlearning as a verifiable task, enables more reliable, efficient, and scalable forgetting, suggesting a promising new direction for unlearning research that combines theoretical guarantees, improved safety, and practical deployment efficiency."}

While state-of-the-art gossip-based methods satisfy the first requirement, achieving robustness remains challenging. Asynchronous decentralized ADMM-based methods have been explored for estimating the median, a statistical centrality measure that is notoriously more robust than the mean. However, existing approaches require memory that scales with node degree, making them impractical when memory is limited. In this paper, we propose AsylADMM, a novel gossip algorithm for decentralized median and quantile estimation, primarily designed for asynchronous updates and requiring only two variables per node. We analyze a synchronous variant of AsylADMM to establish theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate fast convergence for the asynchronous algorithm. We then show that our algorithm enables quantile-based trimming, geometric median estimation, and depth-based trimming, with quantile-based trimming empirically outperforming existing rank-based methods. Finally, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of rank-based trimming via Markov chain theory."}

Our study yields three key insights. First, we demonstrate that NODEs can extrapolate effectively to new boundary conditions, provided the resulting trajectories share dynamic similarity with the training data. Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables. Finally, we find that SR recovers two out of the three governing equations, along with a good approximation for the third, when using data generated by a NODE trained on just 10% of the full simulation.

In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach.

Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines."}

However, most practical pipelines stop at supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and fail to reach the reinforcement learning (RL) alignment stage. The main reason is that RL alignment typically requires either expensive human preference annotation or heavy reliance on high-quality reward models with large-scale API usage and ongoing engineering maintenance, both of which are ill-suited to on-premise settings. To bridge this gap, we propose a positive-unlabeled (PU) RL distillation method for on-premise small-model deployment. Without human-labeled preferences or a reward model, our method distills the teacher's preference-optimization capability from black-box generations into a locally trainable student. For each prompt, we query the teacher once to obtain an anchor response, locally sample multiple student candidates, and perform anchor-conditioned self-ranking to induce pairwise or listwise preferences, enabling a fully local training loop via direct preference optimization or group relative policy optimization. Theoretical analysis justifies that the induced preference signal by our method is order-consistent and concentrates on near-optimal candidates, supporting its stability for preference optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistently strong performance under a low-cost setting."}

We instead learn an explicit optimal transport map that sends any group instance to its counterfactual without re-optimization, minimizing the group's total transport cost. This enables generalization with fewer parameters, making it easier to interpret the common actionable recourse. For linear classifiers, we prove that functions representing group counterfactuals are derived via mathematical optimization, identifying the underlying convex optimization type (QP, QCQP, ...).

For large, continuous endogenous state spaces, we introduce LSVI-PE, a simple linear-approximation method whose regret is polynomial in the feature dimension, exogenous state space, and horizon, independent of the endogenous state and action spaces. Our analysis introduces two new tools: counterfactual trajectories and Bellman-closed feature transport, which together allow greedy policies to have accurate value estimates without optimism.

As the number of unlabeled samples increased, the performance of Cox-MT significantly improved with a given set of labeled data.

To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model. Evaluations on Llama-3.2 show that Hestia consistently outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines, yielding average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for the 1B and 3B models.

This enables a single model to flexibly adapt to arbitrary trade-offs at run-time by producing a policy on or near the Pareto front. However, existing benchmarks for PCPL are largely restricted to toy tasks and fixed environments, limiting their realism and scalability. To address this gap, we introduce GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark built on a novel graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment inspired by city management, which we call CityPlannerEnv. GraphAllocBench provides a rich suite of problems with diverse objective functions, varying preference conditions, and high-dimensional scalability. We also propose two new evaluation metrics -- Proportion of Non-Dominated Solutions (PNDS) and Ordering Score (OS) -- that directly capture preference consistency while complementing the widely used hypervolume metric. Through experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and graph-aware models, we show that GraphAllocBench exposes the limitations of existing MORL approaches and paves the way for using graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks in complex, high-dimensional combinatorial allocation tasks. Beyond its predefined problem set, GraphAllocBench enables users to flexibly vary objectives, preferences, and allocation rules, establishing it as a versatile and extensible benchmark for advancing PCPL.

In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces. In summary, our work offers the first function-space method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models to accurately sample from a posterior."}

Scarce data or datasets dominated by out-of-distribution (OOD) areas exacerbate this issue. Our theoretical analysis and experiments show that the standard squared error objective induces a harmful TD cross covariance. This effect amplifies in OOD areas, biasing optimization and degrading policy learning. To counteract this mechanism, we develop two complementary strategies: partitioned buffer sampling that restricts updates to localized replay partitions, attenuates irregular covariance effects, and aligns update directions, yielding a scheme that is easy to integrate with existing implementations, namely Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD (C^4). We also introduce an explicit gradient-based corrective penalty that cancels the covariance induced bias within each update. We prove that buffer partitioning preserves the lower bound property of the maximization objective, and that these constraints mitigate excessive conservatism in extreme OOD areas without altering the core behavior of policy constrained offline reinforcement learning. Empirically, our method showcases higher stability and up to 30% improvement in returns over prior methods, especially with small datasets and splits that emphasize OOD areas."}

When restricted to hard-label outputs, copying turns into a discontinuous surface reconstruction problem from pointwise queries, severely limiting the ability to recover boundary geometry efficiently. We propose a distance-based copying (distillation) framework that replaces hard-label supervision with signed distances to the teacher's decision boundary, converting copying into a smooth regression problem that exploits local geometry. We develop an $α$-governed smoothing and regularization scheme with Hölder/Lipschitz control over the induced target surface, and introduce two model-agnostic algorithms to estimate signed distances under label-only access. Experiments on synthetic problems and UCI benchmarks show consistent improvements in fidelity and generalization accuracy over hard-label baselines, while enabling distance outputs as uncertainty-related signals for black-box replicas."}

We make two main contributions. First, we provide the first analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees-a key parameter governing active learning label complexity. Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity. Second, we present the first general active learning algorithm for binary classification that achieves a multiplicative error guarantee, producing a $(1+ε)$-approximate classifier. By combining these results, we design an active learning algorithm for decision trees that uses only a polylogarithmic number of label queries in the dataset size, under the stated assumptions. Finally, we establish a label complexity lower bound, showing our algorithm's dependence on the error tolerance $ε$ is close to optimal."}

Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts."}

In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings.

We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems."}

Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the \"Big Two\" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for \"agency\" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for \"communion.\" This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance."}

In addition, we conduct numerical simulation in a more achievable setting, where the ${m\\choose k}$ subset embeddings are chosen as the centroid of the embeddings of the contained elements.

Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level.
