The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL. We validate the CORL method in a simple illustrative combinatorial sequential decision making example."}

Although Shor's algorithm theoretically enables polynomial-time integer factorization, its real-world performance heavily depends on stringent conditions related to the period obtained via quantum phase estimation. Our generalized decomposition method relaxes these conditions by systematically exploiting arbitrary divisors of the obtained period, effectively broadening the applicability of each quantum execution. Extensive classical simulations were performed to empirically validate our approach, involving over one million test cases across integers ranging from 2 to 8 digits. The proposed method achieved near-perfect success rates, exceeding 99.998% for 7-digit numbers and 99.999% for 8-digit numbers, significantly surpassing traditional and recently improved variants of Shor's algorithm. Crucially, this improvement is achieved without compromising the algorithm's polynomial-time complexity and integrates seamlessly with existing quantum computational frameworks. Moreover, our method enhances the efficiency of quantum resource usage by minimizing unnecessary repetitions, making it particularly relevant for quantum cryptanalysis with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study thus provides both theoretical advancements and substantial practical benefits, contributing meaningfully to the field of quantum algorithm research and the broader field of quantum information processing."}

In this direction, space-time correlations between avalanches have proven to be especially difficult to access. One of the main obstacle to do so comes from taking memory effects in a systematic way along the computation. In this paper, we partially fill this gap and derive recursive relations for the particle filling and avalanche 2-points correlation function in the 1D Directed Stochastic Sandpile. These expressions allow to characterize the sign of the correlations and estimates are provided in the particle filling case. In fact, density correlations are shown to be positively correlated. This behavior is directly related to persistence of the local particle filling. On the other hand, we show that avalanches are anticorrelated in the model. This is interpreted by the fact that avalanches disrupt the system and the damage can only be fully compensated after injecting a sufficiently high number of particles. These results indicate an underlying trade off, between static and dynamic observable, for the system to sit in its stationary state. It appears that this balance is controlled by the conservation of the particle number along the avalanches."}

Existing datasets rely on human demonstrations, limiting scalability. A natural alternative is to synthesize data from strong CUAs, yet their rollouts are highly noisy, with incorrect or suboptimal actions consisting a large proportion of the steps, making naive imitation ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that transforms noisy rollouts into reliable supervision without human annotation. The core idea is step-level filtering, which evaluates actions individually to retain only correct steps, complemented by reasoning augmentation for improved planning. Using this pipeline, we construct WebSTAR, a dataset of 13.3K trajectories and 100K graded, reasoning-rich steps synthesized from OpenAI's computer-use-preview model. We train Qwen-2.5-VL-Instruct models (7B and 32B) on WebSTAR. On WebVoyager, our 7B model surpasses SoTA open-source CUA model UI-TARS-1.5-7B by more than 15% with only supervised finetuning. Building on step-level grading, we further create WebSCORE, a dataset of graded step-level actions, and train StepRM, a 7B multimodal reward model distilled from o4-mini, which matches its grading quality while being far more efficient to deploy at scale. Our results establish step-level filtering as a key principle for scalable CUA training and construct two new datasets (WebSTAR, WebSCORE) and a lightweight reward model (StepRM) as practical tools to advance robust and efficient CUAs."}

Here we perform a systematic study by doping non-magnetic Mg2+ into a magnetically complicated system, Co10Ge3O16, which contains three frustrated sublattices of Co2+, e.g., triangular Co1, Kagome Co2 and Co3 sublattices. By growing crystals for (Co1-xMgx)10Ge3O16 (0 < x <= 30%), we observed obvious site preference of Mg2+ on Co1 and Co3 sites over the Co2 site. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm the high purity of the samples and indicate systematic peak shift, consistent with the loading compositions. Although previously investigated, the magnetic structure and expected magnetic frustration in this system are not fully uncovered. Our temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that the high-temperature magnetostructural phase transition with antiferromagnetic ordering and a low-temperature broad peak are suppressed with Mg2+ doping, while two new magnetic features emerge at high Mg2+ level. Moreover, the structural phase transition from high-temperature R-3m to low-temperature C2/m space group is absent at the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature, as confirmed by single-crystal XRD. By analyzing the heat capacity and neutron powder diffraction results of the highest doped sample, (Co0.7Mg0.3)10Ge3O16, we speculate that the Co1 site is responsible for the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering, while the other two sites are short-range correlated in addition to a Mg2+-induced spin-glass state. This study provides more insights into the complex magnetism in Co10Ge3O16 by using the non-magnetic Mg2+ as a probe. However, detailed magnetic structure requires further efforts on growing large single crystals."}

We model the OFEX combinatorial bundling problem as a multi-commodity one-to-one pickup-and-delivery selective traveling salesperson problem (m1-PDSTSP), which optimizes revenue-driven freight bundling under capacity, precedence, and route-length constraints. The key challenge is to couple combinatorial bundle selection with pickup-and-delivery routing under sub-second latency. We propose a learning--accelerated hybrid search pipeline that pairs a Transformer Neural Network-based constructive policy with an innovative Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search (MSLNS) metaheuristic within a rolling-horizon scheme in which the platform repeatedly freezes the current marketplace into a static snapshot and solves it under a short time budget. This pairing leverages the low-latency, high-quality inference of the learning-based constructor alongside the robustness of improvement search; the multi-start design and plausible seeds help LNS to explore the solution space more efficiently. Across benchmarks, our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural combinatorial optimization and metaheuristic baselines in solution quality with comparable time, achieving an optimality gap of less than 2\\% in total revenue relative to the best available exact baseline method. To our knowledge, this is the first work to establish that a Deep Neural Network-based constructor can reliably provide high-quality seeds for (multi-start) improvement heuristics, with applicability beyond the \\textit{m1-PDSTSP} to a broad class of selective traveling salesperson problems and pickup and delivery problems."}

Given computably described pure states |a>, |b> and a time-dependent unitary U(t), define the hitting time as the infimum of t > 0 such that the fidelity between U(t)|a> and |b> reaches a fixed threshold (with infinity if the threshold is never reached). We prove that there is no total algorithm that outputs this hitting time for all inputs; equivalently, the total UHTP is undecidable via a reduction from the halting problem. Operationally, we show a no-go theorem: for any fixed accuracy parameters, there is no universal finite-resource protocol that, for all computably described inputs, correctly outputs the hitting time while obeying uniform finite upper bounds on observation time and on dissipation/work. The proofs use reversible computation embedded into unitary dynamics, a fixed-target beacon construction, and a continuous-time lifting via piecewise-constant Hamiltonians. Our results target systems capable of embedding universal computation and complement prior undecidability results such as spectral-gap and quantum-control reachability. We distinguish logical time (inside the equations) from physical/operational time (of preparation, evolution, measurement), and show that universal time-step selection is impossible in both senses."}

We introduce a model in which visible and hidden variables interact through two independently parametrized transition matrices, defining a Markov chain whose steady state is intrinsically out of equilibrium. Likelihood maximization drives this system toward nonequilibrium steady states with finite entropy production, reduced self-transition probabilities, and persistent probability currents in the latent space. These cycles are not imposed by the architecture but arise from training, and models that develop them avoid the low-log-likelihood regime associated with nearly reversible dynamics while more faithfully reproducing the empirical distribution of data classes. Compared with equilibrium approaches such as restricted Boltzmann machines, our model breaks the detailed balance between the forward and backward conditional transitions and relies on a log-likelihood gradient that depends explicitly on the last two steps of the Markov chain. Hence, this exploration of the interface between nonequilibrium statistical physics and modern machine learning suggests that introducing irreversibility into latent-variable models can enhance generative performance."}

In recent years, methodological advancements led to the multiloop extension of the fRG, which systematically includes loop corrections beyond the conventional one-loop truncation and yields a quantitatively accurate description of two-dimensional lattice systems. At the same time, the single-boson exchange (SBE) decomposition of the two-particle vertex has been shown to offer both computational and interpretative advantages paving the way to more affordable approximation schemes. We here apply their combination coined as multiloop SBE fRG to the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling. After providing a detailed account of the underlying formalism in physical channels, we analyze the results for the frequency- and momentum-dependent vertex functions. We find that the SBE approximation, i.e., without calculating explicitly multi-boson exchange contributions, accurately reproduces the parquet approximation at loop convergence. The presented algorithmic improvement opens the route for the treatment of more challenging parameter regimes and more realistic models."}

Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization."}

First, we present the assumptions and combinatorial foundations of the approach, which are based on direct counting of the system states, in contrast to the previous approaches of Smoluchowski and Marcus--Lushnikov. A method to obtain combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and the corresponding standard deviation is described by solving the simplest example of a constant kernel. Then, we extend consideration to a number of kernels (e.g., additive, product, linear--chain, condensation), which were recently solved by explicitly finding the number of internal states of the cluster of a given size. Next, we show that theoretical predictions for any given kernel may be obtained with no need to find an explicit solution but using a recursive expression. We exploit this opportunity to present the use of combinatorial expressions to solve kernels related to the real processes of aerosol growth and planetesimal formation. At this point, a comparison to numerical results appears. Other potential application fields are indicated, including dust agglomeration and polymer growth. Finally, issues related to the varying precision of the theoretical predictions are summarized. In the last section, we propose open problems."}

We introduce an agentic large language model (LLM)-based framework for automated MDP modeling and policy generation (A-LAMP), that automatically translates free-form natural language task descriptions into an MDP formulation and trained policy. The framework decomposes modeling, coding, and training into verifiable stages, ensuring semantic alignment throughout the pipeline.

We employ this framework to analyze the reduced dynamics of a subsystem and to test whether local decoherence probes quantum chaos in many-body systems. Across paradigmatic spin chain models, we show that while the Choi echo captures key dynamical features, it also exhibits intrinsic limitations that, in certain regions of parameter space, restrict its ability to resolve the integrable-to-chaos transition at the level of spectral correlations. In particular, we demonstrate that local decoherence can spuriously signal quantum chaos in integrable regimes, tracing them to the inability of a strictly local probe to distinguish efficient coherent transport from genuinely scrambling dynamics. Our results show that local decoherence signals are controlled by the entanglement generated between the probe and its environment during the dynamics, rather than by spectral correlations, clarifying the practical scope of local dynamical diagnostics."}

For an open system described by the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF), we show that the equilibrium free energy difference between two canonical endpoints can be written as exponential averages of the HMF shift, divided by an explicit factor built from the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final system marginals. These relations hold at the endpoint level and, under an asymptotic equilibration postulate, admit trajectory representations for general driving and coupling protocols. A decomposition of the HMF increment along each trajectory separates the work-like contributions associated with changes in $λ(t)$ and $C(t)$, the heat-like exchange with the environment, and a feedback-like functional defined with respect to the initial protocol. In the frozen-driving regime with a noninteracting reference, the equalities reduce to new FEP-like expressions involving an environment functional and an explicit overlap correction, with the Zwanzig formula recovered as a limiting case. We validate the approach on an open system coupled to an environment and evolved under overdamped Langevin dynamics, where conventional Zwanzig FEP suffers from poor phase-space overlap and slow numerical convergence, while the present trajectory equality closely matches the exact free energy difference over a broad range of coupling strengths."}

This study proposes a data-driven metric and a continuous reward function to optimize personalized heparin therapy in surgical sepsis patients. Methods: Data from the MIMIC-IV v1.0 and eICU v2.0 databases were used for model development and evaluation. The training cohort consisted of abdominal surgery patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) after postoperative sepsis onset. We introduce a new RL-based framework: converting the discrete SOFA score to a continuous cxSOFA for more nuanced state and reward functions; Second, defining \"good\" or \"bad\" strategies based on cxSOFA by a stepwise manner; Third, proposing a Treatment Effect Comparison Matrix (TECM), analogous to a confusion matrix for classification tasks, to evaluate the treatment strategies. We applied different RL algorithms, Q-Learning, DQN, DDQN, BCQ and CQL to optimize the treatment and comprehensively evaluated the framework. Results: Among the AI-derived strategies, the cxSOFA-CQL model achieved the best performance, reducing mortality from 1.83% to 0.74% with the average hospital stay from 11.11 to 9.42 days. TECM demonstrated consistent outcomes across models, highlighting robustness. Conclusion: The proposed RL framework enables interpretable and robust optimization of heparin therapy in surgical sepsis. Continuous cxSOFA scoring and TECM-based evaluation provide nuanced treatment assessment, showing promise for improving clinical outcomes and decision-support reliability."}

Two complementary measures are introduced: the mutual information energy, a state-independent quantity inspired by Onicescu's information energy that captures the geometric overlap between joint eigenspaces within a context; and an operational measure based on commutator expectation values that reflects contextual behavior at the level of measurement outcomes. We establish a hierarchy of bounds connecting these measures to the Robertson uncertainty relation, including spectral, purity-corrected, and operator norm estimates. The framework is applied to the Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario for spin-1 systems, where all quantities admit closed-form expressions. The Majorana-stellar representation furnishes a common geometric platform on which both the operational measure and the uncertainty products can be analyzed. For spin-1, this representation yields a three-dimensional Euclidean-like visualization of the Hilbert space in which, states lying on a plane exhibit maximum uncertainty for the observable along the perpendicular direction; simultaneous optimization across all KCBS contexts singles out a unique state on the symmetry axis. Notably, states achieving the optimal sum of uncertainty products exhibit vanishing operational contextuality, while states with substantial operational contextuality satisfy a nontrivial Robertson bound -- the two extremes are achieved by distinct quantum states."}

This design enables independent control over the granule's effective temperature and spatial confinement. Our engine quantitatively reproduces the universal power-efficiency trade-offs of finite-time thermodynamics, achieving the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency at maximum power.

To bridge this gap, we propose MolSculpt, a novel framework that \"sculpts\" 3D molecular geometries from chemical syntax. MolSculpt is built upon a frozen 1D molecular foundation model and a 3D molecular diffusion model. We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation.

Recently, in a class of kagome superconductors represented by CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, experimental reports have suggested rotational symmetry breaking and time reversal symmetry breaking associated with a charge density wave (CDW) order, revealing an exotic nature of this CDW order. Here, utilizing our recently developed capability of performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tunable magnetic field (magneto-ARPES), we reveal momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. While the response in the electronic structure is clearly compatible with piezomagnetism, strong orbital-selectivity is observed. Specifically, bands associated with the vanadium $d$-orbitals contributing to the Van Hove singularities (VHS) near the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary exhibit selective spectral broadening that breaks C$_6$ rotational symmetry and is odd in magnetic field, disappearing above the CDW transition. Meanwhile, the antimony $p$-orbital dominated electron pocket at the BZ center becomes elongated under an applied field -- an effect that persists above the $T_{\\rm CDW}$. Our observations delineate the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking associated with the vanadium VHS-bands at the onset of the CDW order, while the field-induced rotational symmetry breaking largely associated with the antimony $p$ orbitals reflects fluctuations beyond the CDW ordering temperature. Our magneto-ARPES work demonstrates a novel tuning knob for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials."}

Second, for mixed Gaussian states, we constructively demonstrate that the notion of a partner subsystem splits into two: a correlation partner, which contains all classical and quantum correlations and need not correspond to a single degree of freedom, and an entanglement partner, which is always at most single-mode. Finally, we extend the construction of partners to multi-mode subsystems. Together, these results provide conceptual practical tools to study how bipartite correlations and entanglement are structured and where they can be found in complex Gaussian many-body systems."}

We consider the ramped and periodically-driven Falicov-Kimball and Hubbard models within time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory.

This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $α,β$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure on a broad range of benchmarks where, in some instances, we witness a 96% reduction in the number of subproblems during branch-and-bound, and also achieve state-of-the-art verified accuracy across multiple benchmarks.

In condensed matter physics, vigorous research has clarified how chiral materials harbour unconventional electronic and vibrational responses. In parallel, recent studies have demonstrated that chiral structures can be engineered or tuned from achiral precursors. Despite these complementary advances, an integrated understanding of electronic and phononic dynamics, self-organized chiral structures, and their interplay is still lacking. Such an integrated framework is crucial both for elucidating the spontaneous formation and stabilization of chiral structures and for advancing the electronic functionalities of chiral materials. Here, we predict novel spontaneous structural phase transitions unique to chiral crystals with screw symmetry. In quasi-one-dimensional chiral crystals, the phonon frequency renormalized by the electron-phonon coupling depends on the handedness of circular polarization. Consequently, the soft mode encoding the intrinsic phonon angular momentum induces spin-selective Peierls gaps in the electronic band, entailing a helical spin density wave and chiral lattice distortion. We also elucidate the chiral signature of collective modes. Our findings offer new avenues for advanced spintronics applications and crucial insights into the elusive mechanisms underlying the formation process of chirality in nature."}

These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane has been proposed to be responsible for the dramatic peak-dip-hump(PDH) structure in the anti-nodal spectrum. The recent observation of the exceptional flat quasiparticle dispersion in the anti-nodal region and the sudden suppression of the PDH structure around the pseudogap end point cast doubts on such a scenario. Instead, a scenario involving the coupling to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation seems to resolve both puzzles naturally. Here we present a systematic study on the interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling in the cuprate superconductors. We show that the coupling strength to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction caused by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the $\\mathbf{q}\\rightarrow 0$ limit as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon coupling at electron momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. Counterintuitively, we find that the same vertex correction enhances the phonon contribution to the PDH structure. We also find that while the coupling to either the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation or the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode can generate a PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum with similar phenomenologies, the sudden suppression of such a structure around the pseudogap end point should be mainly attributed to the dramatic change in the nature of the spin fluctuation at such a critical doping. We suggest to take the PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum as a spectral signature for the emergence of fluctuating local moment in the pseudogap phase and the entrance of a doped Mott insulating state."}

Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere.

Multi-objective Bayesian optimization is a promising solution for such expensive, black-box problems: it fits probabilistic surrogates and selects new designs via an acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation. In practice, it requires tailored choices of surrogate and acquisition that rarely transfer to the next problem, is myopic when multi-step planning is often required, and adds refitting overhead, particularly in parallel or time-sensitive loops. We present TAMO, a fully amortized, universal policy for multi-objective black-box optimization. TAMO uses a transformer architecture that operates across varying input and objective dimensions, enabling pretraining on diverse corpora and transfer to new problems without retraining: at test time, the pretrained model proposes the next design with a single forward pass. We pretrain the policy with reinforcement learning to maximize cumulative hypervolume improvement over full trajectories, conditioning on the entire query history to approximate the Pareto frontier. Across synthetic benchmarks and real tasks, TAMO produces fast proposals, reducing proposal time by 50-1000x versus alternatives while matching or improving Pareto quality under tight evaluation budgets.

The second stage employs CFM, a simulation-free continuous normalizing flow technique, to refine these solutions toward optimality through learned vector field regression. Evaluated on the IEEE 30-bus system across five load scenarios ranging from 70\\% to 130\\% nominal load, our method achieves near-optimal solutions with cost gaps below 0.1\\% for nominal loads and below 3\\% for extreme conditions, while maintaining 100\\% feasibility. Our framework bridges the gap between fast but approximate neural network predictions and optimal but slow numerical solvers, offering a practical solution for modern power systems with high renewable penetration requiring frequent dispatch updates."}

We also generated synthetic versions of each sample with carefully crafted prompts to preserve the original content while reflecting subgroup-specific writing styles. Using this, we evaluate four open-source state-of-the-art AI text detectors and find consistent disparities in detection performance, particularly low recall rates for texts from underrepresented groups.

Although many mitigation strategies exist, their connection to convergence performance under different iteration budgets remains unclear. Moreover, a systematic analysis identifying which state-of-the-art mitigation techniques perform best under specific scenarios is also lacking. We benchmark four approaches, Local-Global, Adiabatic, State Efficient Ansatz (SEA), and Pretrained VQE, against standard VQE on molecular systems from 4 to 14 qubits, analyzing gradient variance up to 50 layers and convergence over 1000 iterations. Our results show that the impact of gradient preservation is iteration-dependent. In the 14-qubit BeH2 system, Pretrained VQE outperforms SEA at 100 iterations despite lower gradient variance, but SEA becomes 2.2x more accurate at 1000 iterations. For smaller systems, SEA achieves near-exact energies (H2: 10^-5 Ha, LiH: 2x10^-4 Ha) with fidelities 0.999, while standard methods plateau early.

In this paper, we study a new and challenging setting of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. First, to highlight the fundamental challenges introduced by the long-term fairness regularizer evaluated based on the entire sequence of actions, we prove that even without switching costs, no online algorithms can possibly achieve a sublinear regret or finite competitive ratio compared to the offline optimal algorithm as the problem episode length $T$ increases. Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\\to\\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions."}

The evolution governed by the Liouville operator preserves many properties of full quantum dynamics, including the conservation of total population, energy, and purity, and has shown quantitative agreement with exact quantum results for the expectation values of many observables where direct comparisons are feasible. However, since the QCLE density matrix operator is obtained from the partial Wigner transform of the full quantum density matrix, its matrix elements can have negative values, implying that the diagonal matrix elements behave as pseudo-densities rather than densities of classical phase space. Here, we compare phase-space distributions generated by exact quantum dynamics with those produced by QCLE evolution from pure quantum initial states. We show that resonance effects in the off-diagonal matrix elements differ qualitatively, particularly for low-energy states. Furthermore, numerical and analytical results for low-dimensional models reveal that the QCLE can violate the positivity of marginal phase-space densities, a property that should hold at all times for any physical system. A perturbative analysis of a model system confirms that such violations arise generically. We also show that the violations of positivity of the marginal densities vanish as the initial energy of the system increases relative to the energy gap between subsystem states. These findings suggest that a negativity index, quantifying deviations from positivity, may provide a useful metric for assessing the validity of mixed quantum\\textendash{}classical descriptions."}

Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME. This approach will allow to chart truly collective entanglement in quantum matter both in and out of equilibrium."}

First, EfficientNetV2 is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled portions of the scientific ensemble datasets.

However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($Δt$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $Δt$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $ε\\to 0$ of the error parameter $ε$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $ε\\neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($ε^2$) vs O($Δt$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $ε$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $ε$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage."}

Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality.

The natural progression has been toward larger, more comprehensive and challenging collections of static problems, an approach that inadvertently constrains the kinds of advances we can measure and incentivize. To address this limitation, we argue for progress-oriented benchmarks, problem environments whose objectives are themselves the core targets of scientific progress, so that achieving state of the art on the benchmark advances the field. As a introductory step, we instantiate an environment based on the NanoGPT speedrun. The environment standardizes a dataset slice, a reference model and training harness, and rich telemetry, with run-time verification and anti-gaming checks. Evaluation centers on the scientific delta achieved: best-attained loss and the efficiency frontier. Using this environment, we achieve a new state-of-the-art training time, improving upon the previous record by 3 seconds, and qualitatively observe the emergence of novel algorithmic ideas. Moreover, comparisons between models and agents remain possible, but they are a means, not the end; the benchmark's purpose is to catalyze reusable improvements to the language modeling stack. With this release, the overarching goal is to seed a community shift from static problem leaderboards to test-time research on open-ended yet measurable scientific problems. In this new paradigm, progress on the benchmark is progress on the science, thus reframing \"benchmarking\" as a vehicle for scientific advancement."}

Existing datasets rely on human demonstrations, limiting scalability. A natural alternative is to synthesize data from strong CUAs, yet their rollouts are highly noisy, with incorrect or suboptimal actions consisting a large proportion of the steps, making naive imitation ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that transforms noisy rollouts into reliable supervision without human annotation. The core idea is step-level filtering, which evaluates actions individually to retain only correct steps, complemented by reasoning augmentation for improved planning. Using this pipeline, we construct WebSTAR, a dataset of 13.3K trajectories and 100K graded, reasoning-rich steps synthesized from OpenAI's computer-use-preview model. We train Qwen-2.5-VL-Instruct models (7B and 32B) on WebSTAR. On WebVoyager, our 7B model surpasses SoTA open-source CUA model UI-TARS-1.5-7B by more than 15% with only supervised finetuning. Building on step-level grading, we further create WebSCORE, a dataset of graded step-level actions, and train StepRM, a 7B multimodal reward model distilled from o4-mini, which matches its grading quality while being far more efficient to deploy at scale. Our results establish step-level filtering as a key principle for scalable CUA training and construct two new datasets (WebSTAR, WebSCORE) and a lightweight reward model (StepRM) as practical tools to advance robust and efficient CUAs."}

However, the practical use of the Earth's magnetic field for geo-localization hinges on an ultra-sensitive magnetometer. This work investigates how quantum magnetic sensing can be used for this purpose. We theoretically derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the estimation error of quantum sensing when using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and prove the quantum advantage over classical magnetometers. Moreover, we employ a practical distributed quantum sensing protocol to saturate CRLB. Based on the estimated magnetic field and the earth's magnetic field map, we formulate geo-localization as a map-matching problem and introduce a coarse-to-fine Mahalanobis distance search in both gradient space (local field derivatives) and corner space (raw field samples). We simulate the proposed quantum sensing-based geo-localization framework over four cities in the United States and Canada. The results report that in high-gradient regions, gradient-space Mahalanobis search achieves sub-kilometer median localization error; while in magnetically smoother areas, corner-space search provides better accuracy and a $4-8\\times$ reduction in runtime."}

Several studies have compared common activation functions on benchmark differential equations, and have unanimously found that the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is outperformed by competitors such as the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and swish activation functions. In this work, we diagnose the poor performance of ReLU on physics-informed machine learning problems. While it is well-known that the piecewise linear form of ReLU prevents it from being used on second-order differential equations, we show that ReLU fails even on variational problems involving only first derivatives. We identify the cause of this failure as second derivatives of the activation, which are taken not in the formulation of the loss, but in the process of training. Namely, we show that automatic differentiation in PyTorch fails to characterize derivatives of discontinuous fields, which causes the gradient of the physics-informed loss to be mis-specified, thus explaining the poor performance of ReLU."}

In this work, we show a fundamental limit for quantum state verification for all cut-and-choose approaches used to verify arbitrary quantum states. We provide a no-go result showing that the cut-and-choose techniques cannot lead to quantum state verification protocols that are both efficient in the number of rounds and secure.

While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective unlearning at the concept level.\n  To address this, we introduce a Gradient Projection Framework designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework drastically reduces memorization while rigorously preserving generation quality and semantic fidelity. By reframing memorization control as selective learning, our approach establishes a new paradigm for IP-safe and privacy-preserving generative AI."}

We investigate quantum machine learning for this task, focusing on Quantum Kernel Methods (QKMs) applied to real and complex SAR chips extracted from the SARFish dataset. We tackle two binary classification problems, the first for distinguishing vessels from non-vessels, and the second for distinguishing fishing vessels from other types of vessels. We compare QKMs applied to real and complex SAR chips against classical Laplacian, RBF, and linear kernels applied to real SAR chips. Using noiseless numerical simulations of the quantum kernels, we find that QKMs are capable of obtaining equal or better performance than the classical kernel on these tasks in the best case, but do not demonstrate a clear advantage for the complex SAR data.

To bridge this gap, we propose MolSculpt, a novel framework that \"sculpts\" 3D molecular geometries from chemical syntax. MolSculpt is built upon a frozen 1D molecular foundation model and a 3D molecular diffusion model. We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation. In this way, our model deeply integrates 1D latent chemical knowledge into the 3D generation process through end-to-end optimization. Experiments demonstrate that MolSculpt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in \\textit{de novo} 3D molecule generation and conditional 3D molecule generation, showing superior 3D fidelity and stability on both the GEOM-DRUGS and QM9 datasets.

Specifically, the internal energy coherence needed for precise timekeeping affects the center of mass dynamics, enhancing position spreading during free evolution. As a result, a single composite system cannot act as a perfect quantum reference frame for both space and time, leading to a Heisenberg like uncertainty relation between spatial and temporal intervals.

In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $α,β$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure on a broad range of benchmarks where, in some instances, we witness a 96% reduction in the number of subproblems during branch-and-bound, and also achieve state-of-the-art verified accuracy across multiple benchmarks.

As an application of our construction, we introduce novel flow-based decompositions for known two-dimensional encodings, leading to efficient circuit decompositions of time-evolution unitaries.

Multi-objective Bayesian optimization is a promising solution for such expensive, black-box problems: it fits probabilistic surrogates and selects new designs via an acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation. In practice, it requires tailored choices of surrogate and acquisition that rarely transfer to the next problem, is myopic when multi-step planning is often required, and adds refitting overhead, particularly in parallel or time-sensitive loops. We present TAMO, a fully amortized, universal policy for multi-objective black-box optimization. TAMO uses a transformer architecture that operates across varying input and objective dimensions, enabling pretraining on diverse corpora and transfer to new problems without retraining: at test time, the pretrained model proposes the next design with a single forward pass. We pretrain the policy with reinforcement learning to maximize cumulative hypervolume improvement over full trajectories, conditioning on the entire query history to approximate the Pareto frontier. Across synthetic benchmarks and real tasks, TAMO produces fast proposals, reducing proposal time by 50-1000x versus alternatives while matching or improving Pareto quality under tight evaluation budgets.

Under such double coupling, it is found that while the Hamiltonian of the system is clearly Hermitian the dynamics of the quadrature components of the field operators can be attributed to non-Hermicity of the system. It is manifested in an asymmetric coupling between the quadrature components which then leads to a variety of remarkable features. In particular, we identify how the emerging exceptional point controls the conversion of thermal states of the modes into single-mode classically or quantum squeezed states. Furthermore, for reservoirs being in squeezed states, we find that the two-photon correlations present in these reservoirs are responsible for unidirectional flow of populations and correlations among the modes and the flow can be controlled by appropriate tuning of the mutual orientation of the squeezed noise ellipses. In the course of analyzing these effects we find that the flow of the population creates the first-order coherence between the modes which, on the other hand rules out an enhancement of the two photon correlations responsible for entanglement between the modes. These results suggest new alternatives for the creation of single mode squeezed fields and the potential applications for controlled unidirectional transfer of population and correlations in bosonic chains."}

In this paper, we study a new and challenging setting of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. First, to highlight the fundamental challenges introduced by the long-term fairness regularizer evaluated based on the entire sequence of actions, we prove that even without switching costs, no online algorithms can possibly achieve a sublinear regret or finite competitive ratio compared to the offline optimal algorithm as the problem episode length $T$ increases. Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\\to\\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions."}

First, EfficientNetV2 is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled portions of the scientific ensemble datasets. By jointly optimizing the reconstruction, clustering, and contrastive objectives, our method encourages similar data points to group together while separating distinct clusters in the latent space. UMAP is subsequently applied to this latent representation to produce 2D projections, which are evaluated using the silhouette score. Multiple types of autoencoders are evaluated and compared based on their ability to extract meaningful features. Experiments on two scientific ensemble datasets - channel structures in soil derived from Markov chain Monte Carlo, and droplet-on-film impact dynamics - show that models incorporating clustering or contrastive loss marginally outperform the baseline approaches."}

Their potential exposure to external world makes them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Existing detection methods against controller logic attacks use either specification-based or learnt models. However, specification-based models require experts' manual efforts or access to PLC's source code, while machine learning-based models often fall short of providing explanation for their decisions. We design SRLR -- a it Symbolic Regression based Logic Recovery} solution to identify the logic of a PLC based only on its inputs and outputs. The recovered logic is used to generate explainable rules for detecting controller logic attacks. SRLR enhances the latest deep symbolic regression methods using the following ICS-specific properties: (1) some important ICS control logic is best represented in frequency domain rather than time domain; (2) an ICS controller can operate in multiple modes, each using different logic, where mode switches usually do not happen frequently; (3) a robust controller usually filters out outlier inputs as ICS sensor data can be noisy; and (4) with the above factors captured, the degree of complexity of the formulas is reduced, making effective search possible. Thanks to these enhancements, SRLR consistently outperforms all existing methods in a variety of ICS settings that we evaluate. In terms of the recovery accuracy, SRLR's gain can be as high as 39% in some challenging environment. We also evaluate SRLR on a distribution grid containing hundreds of voltage regulators, demonstrating its stability in handling large-scale, complex systems with varied configurations."}

Quantum error correction (QEC) is vital for handling qubits, which are vulnerable to external noise. In QEC, actual errors are predicted from the results of syndrome measurements by stabilizer generators, in place of making direct measurements of the data qubits. Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5. This suggests that implementing quantum error correction using a Transformer may enable the Golay code to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation more efficiently."}

Using the GHZ state as a representative example, we demonstrate that while fully correlated measurements can initially distinguish a macroscopic superposition from its corresponding classical mixture, generic many-body evolution renders them operationally indistinguishable for most times during the evolution. By analyzing both distinguishability measures and established quantifiers of macroscopic quantumness, we find that equilibration not only hides coherence from accessible observables but also suppresses macroscopic superpositions themselves. These results identify unitary thermalization, independent of environmental decoherence, as a fundamental mechanism that limits the emergence of macroscopic quantum effects."}

We propose Co-TSFA (Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies), a regularization framework that learns when to ignore anomalies and when to respond. Co-TSFA generates input-only and input-output augmentations to model forecast-irrelevant and forecast-relevant anomalies, and introduces a latent-output alignment loss that ties representation changes to forecast changes.

We develop three battery-specific modules, including dilated temporal blocks for efficient temporal encoding, chunked attention blocks for context modeling, and a dual-head output block for fusing short- and long-term battery degradation patterns. Together, the modules enable Pace to predict battery health accurately and efficiently in various battery usage conditions. In a large public dataset, Pace performs much better than existing models, achieving an average performance improvement of 6.5 and 2.0x compared to two best-performing baseline models.

However, raw sensor streams are often imbalanced and contain significant redundancy, meaning that not all data points contribute equally to model generalization. In this paper, we show that, in some cases, \"less is more\" when considering datasets. We do this by reframing the data selection problem: rather than tuning model hyperparameters, we fix the model and optimize the composition of the training data itself. We introduce a framework for discovering the optimal \"training diet\" from a large, unlabeled time series corpus. Our framework first uses a large-scale encoder and k-means clustering to partition the dataset into distinct, behaviorally consistent clusters. These clusters represent the fundamental 'ingredients' available for training. We then employ the Optuna optimization framework to search the high-dimensional space of possible data mixtures. For each trial, Optuna proposes a specific sampling ratio for each cluster, and a new training set is constructed based on this recipe. A smaller target model is then trained and evaluated. Our experiments reveal that this data-centric search consistently discovers data mixtures that yield models with significantly higher performance compared to baselines trained on the entire dataset. Specifically - evaluated on PMSM dataset - our method improved performance from a baseline MSE of 1.70 to 1.37, a 19.41% improvement."}

Although purely data-driven models demonstrate strong fitting performance, their interpretability and cross-distribution generalization capabilities remain limited. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid model, SEPI-TFPNet, which integrates empirical models with deep learning. The physical-prior submodule employs a spectral entropy discrimination mechanism to select the most suitable empirical model under different excitation waveforms. The data-driven submodule incorporates convolutional neural networks, multi-head attention mechanisms, and bidirectional long short-term memory networks to extract flux-density time-series features. An adaptive feature fusion module is introduced to improve multimodal feature interaction and integration.

While steering these policies with reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising mechanism for fine-tuning beyond demonstration data, directly applying standard (non-equivariant) RL can be sample-inefficient and unstable, as it ignores the symmetries that EDPs are designed to exploit. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the diffusion process of an EDP is equivariant, which in turn induces a group-invariant latent-noise MDP that is well-suited for equivariant diffusion steering. Building on this theory, we introduce a principled symmetry-aware steering framework and compare standard, equivariant, and approximately equivariant RL strategies through comprehensive experiments across tasks with varying degrees of symmetry. While we identify the practical boundaries of strict equivariance under symmetry breaking, we show that exploiting symmetry during the steering process yields substantial benefits-enhancing sample efficiency, preventing value divergence, and achieving strong policy improvements even when EDPs are trained from extremely limited demonstrations."}

A major theoretical challenge is to construct dynamical models that are simultaneously consistent with classical thermodynamics and complete positivity. In this work, we develop a framework that addresses this issue by extending classical stochastic dynamics to the quantum domain. We begin by formulating a generalized Langevin equation in which both friction and noise act symmetrically on the two Hamiltonian equations. From this, we derive a generalized Klein-Kramers equation expressed in terms of Poisson brackets, and we show that it admits the Boltzmann distribution as its stationary solution while satisfying the first and second laws of thermodynamics along individual trajectories. Applying canonical quantization to this classical framework yields two distinct quantum master equations, depending on whether the friction operators are taken to be Hermitian or non-Hermitian. By analyzing the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the conditions under which these equations reduce to a Lindblad-type generator. Our results demonstrate that complete positivity is ensured only when friction and noise are included in both Hamiltonian equations, thus fully justifying the classical construction. Moreover, we find that the friction coefficients must satisfy the same positivity condition in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian formulations, revealing a form of universality that transcends the specific operator representation. The formalism offers a versatile tool for deriving quantum versions of the thermodynamic laws and is directly applicable to a wide class of nonequilibrium nanoscale systems."}

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for trust prediction, owing to their ability to learn expressive node representations that capture intricate trust relationships within a network. However, current GNN-based trust prediction models face several limitations: (i) Most of them fail to capture trust dynamicity, leading to questionable inferences. (ii) They rarely consider the heterogeneous nature of real-world networks, resulting in a loss of rich semantics. (iii) None of them support context-awareness, a basic property of trust, making prediction results coarse-grained.\n  To this end, we propose CAT, the first Context-Aware GNN-based Trust prediction model that supports trust dynamicity and accurately represents real-world heterogeneity. CAT consists of a graph construction layer, an embedding layer, a heterogeneous attention layer, and a prediction layer. It handles dynamic graphs using continuous-time representations and captures temporal information through a time encoding function. To model graph heterogeneity and leverage semantic information, CAT employs a dual attention mechanism that identifies the importance of different node types and nodes within each type. For context-awareness, we introduce a new notion of meta-paths to extract contextual features. By constructing context embeddings and integrating a context-aware aggregator, CAT can predict both context-aware trust and overall trust. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CAT outperforms five groups of baselines in trust prediction, while exhibiting strong scalability to large-scale graphs and robustness against both trust-oriented and GNN-oriented attacks."}

This result enables a precise estimation of the time resources needed for quantum simulations and quantum algorithms implemented within the DAQC framework, facilitating a rigorous comparison with other approaches."}

In this work, we extend the concept of adversarial graphs to the community detection problem, which is more challenging. We propose novel attack and defense techniques for community detection problem, with the objective of hiding targeted individuals from detection models and enhancing the robustness of community detection models, respectively. These techniques have many applications in real-world scenarios, for example, protecting personal privacy in social networks and understanding camouflage patterns in transaction networks. To simulate interactive attack and defense behaviors, we further propose a game-theoretic framework, called CD-GAME. One player is a graph attacker, while the other player is a Rayleigh Quotient defender. The CD-GAME models the mutual influence and feedback mechanisms between the attacker and the defender, revealing the dynamic evolutionary process of the game. Both players dynamically update their strategies until they reach the Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack and defense methods, and both outperform existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, CD-GAME provides valuable insights for understanding interactive attack and defense scenarios in community detection problems. We found that in traditional single-step attack or defense, attacker tends to employ strategies that are most effective, but are easily detected and countered by defender. When the interactive game reaches a Nash equilibrium, attacker adopts more imperceptible strategies that can still achieve satisfactory attack effectiveness even after defense."}

To address this issue, we introduce Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization (NSPO), a novel RL framework for LLM safety alignment while preserving their core abilities. The safety policy gradients are geometrically projected into the null space of general tasks, thereby mitigating the safety alignment tax.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSPO outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance without sacrificing accuracy on general tasks, including math, code, and instruction-following tasks.

While Gaussian Blurring Mean Shift (GBMS) has proven effective for identifying arbitrarily shaped clusters in Euclidean space, it struggles with datasets exhibiting hierarchical or tree-like structures. In this work, we introduce HypeGBMS, a novel extension of GBMS to hyperbolic space. Our method replaces Euclidean computations with hyperbolic distances and employs Möbius-weighted means to ensure that all updates remain consistent with the geometry of the space. HypeGBMS effectively captures latent hierarchies while retaining the density-seeking behavior of GBMS. We provide theoretical insights into convergence and computational complexity, along with empirical results that demonstrate improved clustering quality in hierarchical datasets. This work bridges classical mean-shift clustering and hyperbolic representation learning, offering a principled approach to density-based clustering in curved spaces. Extensive experimental evaluations on $11$ real-world datasets demonstrate that HypeGBMS significantly outperforms conventional mean-shift clustering methods in non-Euclidean settings, underscoring its robustness and effectiveness."}

We propose Co-TSFA (Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies), a regularization framework that learns when to ignore anomalies and when to respond. Co-TSFA generates input-only and input-output augmentations to model forecast-irrelevant and forecast-relevant anomalies, and introduces a latent-output alignment loss that ties representation changes to forecast changes.

However, raw sensor streams are often imbalanced and contain significant redundancy, meaning that not all data points contribute equally to model generalization. In this paper, we show that, in some cases, \"less is more\" when considering datasets. We do this by reframing the data selection problem: rather than tuning model hyperparameters, we fix the model and optimize the composition of the training data itself. We introduce a framework for discovering the optimal \"training diet\" from a large, unlabeled time series corpus. Our framework first uses a large-scale encoder and k-means clustering to partition the dataset into distinct, behaviorally consistent clusters. These clusters represent the fundamental 'ingredients' available for training. We then employ the Optuna optimization framework to search the high-dimensional space of possible data mixtures. For each trial, Optuna proposes a specific sampling ratio for each cluster, and a new training set is constructed based on this recipe. A smaller target model is then trained and evaluated. Our experiments reveal that this data-centric search consistently discovers data mixtures that yield models with significantly higher performance compared to baselines trained on the entire dataset. Specifically - evaluated on PMSM dataset - our method improved performance from a baseline MSE of 1.70 to 1.37, a 19.41% improvement."}

MKL seeks an optimal linear combination of base kernels that maximizes a generalized performance measure under a regularization constraint. Various norms have been used to regularize the kernel weights, including $l1$, $l2$ and $lp$, as well as the \"elastic-net\" penalty, which combines $l1$- and $l2$-norm to promote both sparsity and the selection of correlated kernels. This property makes elastic-net regularized MKL (ENMKL) especially valuable when model interpretability is critical and kernels capture correlated information, such as in neuroimaging. Previous ENMKL methods have followed a two-stage procedure: fix kernel weights, train a support vector machine (SVM) with the weighted kernel, and then update the weights via gradient descent, cutting-plane methods, or surrogate functions. Here, we introduce an alternative ENMKL formulation that yields a simple analytical update for the kernel weights. We derive explicit algorithms for both SVM and kernel ridge regression (KRR) under this framework, and implement them in the open-source Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo). We evaluate these ENMKL algorithms against $l1$-norm MKL and against SVM (or KRR) trained on the unweighted sum of kernels across three neuroimaging applications. Our results show that ENMKL matches or outperforms $l1$-norm MKL in all tasks and only underperforms standard SVM in one scenario.

Conventional methods such as the Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction scale exponentially with molecular size, limiting their applicability to large molecules. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative by mapping molecular Hamiltonians by qubits, enabling cheaper computational scaling. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to formulate molecular ground state calculations as discrete optimization problems, addressable by quantum annealing. However, these efforts have been limited by previous generations of hardware and suboptimal annealing techniques. Here, the $H_{2}O$ ground-state problem is mapped to an Ising Hamiltonian using the Xian-Bias-Kas (XBK) method. By taking advantage of enhanced qubit connectivity and shorter embedding chains, it is solved with a more than doubled probability of achieving Hartree-Fock-level solutions with respect to the most advanced predecessor. Advanced annealing strategies extend Hartree-Fock-level accuracy to significantly larger problem instances, enabling solutions that use nearly 2.5 times more physically embedded qubits than the largest cases previously reported and allowing to improve annealing results by two orders of magnitude, reaching an energy difference of 0.120~Hartree relative to Hartree-Fock. These results show tangible progress toward practical quantum annealing applications in NISQ era."}

We analyze nonlinear models with the logistic loss and show that the steps of GD reduce to those of generalized perceptron algorithms (Rosenblatt, 1958), providing a new perspective on the dynamics. This reduction yields significantly simpler algorithmic steps, which we analyze using classical linear algebra tools. Using these tools, we demonstrate on a minimalistic example that the nonlinearity in a two-layer model can provably yield a faster iteration complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{d})$ compared to $Ω(d)$ achieved by linear models, where $d$ is the number of features. This helps explain the optimization dynamics and the implicit acceleration phenomenon observed in neural networks. The theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical experiments.

However, existing research communities address these challenges in isolation. Continual Learning (CL) focuses on long-term retention and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, often without strict real-time constraints. Stream Learning (SL) emphasizes rapid, efficient adaptation to high-frequency data streams, but typically neglects forgetting. Recent efforts have tried to combine these paradigms, yet no clear algorithmic overlap exists. We argue that large in-context tabular models (LTMs) provide a natural bridge for Streaming Continual Learning (SCL). In our view, unbounded streams should be summarized on-the-fly into compact sketches that can be consumed by LTMs. This recovers the classical SL motivation of compressing massive streams with fixed-size guarantees, while simultaneously aligning with the experience-replay desiderata of CL. To clarify this bridge, we show how the SL and CL communities implicitly adopt a divide-to-conquer strategy to manage the tension between plasticity (performing well on the current distribution) and stability (retaining past knowledge), while also imposing a minimal complexity constraint that motivates diversification (avoiding redundancy in what is stored) and retrieval (re-prioritizing past information when needed). Within this perspective, we propose structuring SCL with LTMs around two core principles of data selection for in-context learning: (1) distribution matching, which balances plasticity and stability, and (2) distribution compression, which controls memory size through diversification and retrieval mechanisms."}

However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($Δt$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $Δt$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $ε\\to 0$ of the error parameter $ε$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $ε\\neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($ε^2$) vs O($Δt$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $ε$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $ε$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage."}

Bayesian optimization, a widely used black-box and sample-efficient learning method, constructs a probabilistic surrogate of the closed-loop performance from few experiments and uses it to select informative controller parameters. However, it typically struggles with dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations, as they may appear, for example, in tuning model predictive controllers, because standard surrogate models fail to capture the structure of such spaces. This work suggests that the use of Bayesian neural networks as surrogate models may help to mitigate this limitation. Through a comparison between Gaussian processes with Matern kernels, finite-width Bayesian neural networks, and infinite-width Bayesian neural networks on a cart-pole task, we find that Bayesian neural network surrogate models achieve faster and more reliable convergence of the closed-loop cost and enable successful optimization of parameterizations with hundreds of dimensions. Infinite-width Bayesian neural networks also maintain performance in settings with more than one thousand parameters, whereas Matern-kernel Gaussian processes rapidly lose effectiveness. These results indicate that Bayesian neural network surrogate models may be suitable for learning dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations and offer practical guidance for selecting surrogate models in learning-based controller design."}

While robust aggregation methods (including Krum, Bulyan, and coordinate-wise defenses) offer theoretical guarantees under idealized assumptions, their effectiveness erodes substantially when client data distributions are heterogeneous (non-IID) and adversaries can observe or approximate the defense mechanism.\n  This paper introduces SpectralKrum, a defense that fuses spectral subspace estimation with geometric neighbor-based selection. The core insight is that benign optimization trajectories, despite per-client heterogeneity, concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold that can be estimated from historical aggregates. SpectralKrum projects incoming updates into this learned subspace, applies Krum selection in compressed coordinates, and filters candidates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a data-driven threshold. The method requires no auxiliary data, operates entirely on model updates, and preserves FL privacy properties.\n  We evaluate SpectralKrum against eight robust baselines across seven attack scenarios on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet-distributed non-IID partitions (alpha = 0.1).

We introduce the concept of a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) scar subspace -- a Hilbert subspace stabilized by a restricted spectrum-generating algebra (rSGA) while being protected by on-site, inversion, and time-reversal symmetries. QMBS often admit a non-interacting quasiparticle description, which enables matrix-product representations with small bond dimension. Although individual QMBS do not necessarily retain the protecting symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we show that the subspace formed by the symmetry-connected QMBS does retain them, giving rise to consistently emerging topological properties across the entire scar subspace. Using the spin-$1$ Affleck--Kennedy--Lieb--Tasaki (AKLT) model, we demonstrate that its bimagnon scar subspace reflects the topological properties of the SPT ground state, as evidenced by the appropriate bond-space symmetry representations, the expected topological response, and the numerically verified long-range string order. Our findings indicate that scar subspaces can inherit -- and in inhomogeneous cases systematically modify -- the topological character of the SPT ground state, offering a new and experimentally accessible platform for probing symmetry-protected topology beyond the ground-state regime."}

Building on this insight, we establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the output and gradient of softmax attention, quantifying how rapidly the finite-prompt model approaches its infinite-prompt counterpart, and prove that this concentration remains stable along the entire training trajectory in general in-context learning settings with sub-Gaussian tokens. In the case of in-context linear regression, we use the tractable infinite-prompt dynamics to analyze training at finite prompt length. Our results allow optimization analyses developed for linear attention to transfer directly to softmax attention when prompts are sufficiently long, showing that large-prompt softmax attention inherits the analytical structure of its linear counterpart. This, in turn, provides a principled and broadly applicable toolkit for studying the training dynamics and statistical behavior of softmax attention layers in large prompt regimes."}

Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5.

We present a simple geometric method for discovering interactions and redundancies: when elements are added in random sequential orders and their contributions plotted over many trials, characteristic L-shaped patterns emerge that directly reflect interaction structure. The approach quantifies how the contribution of each element depends on those added before it, revealing patterns that distinguish interaction, independence, and redundancy on a unified scale. When pairwise contributions are visualized as two--dimensional point clouds, redundant pairs form L--shaped patterns where only the first-added element contributes, while synergistic pairs form L--shaped patterns where only elements contribute together. Independent elements show order--invariant distributions. We formalize this with the L--score, a continuous measure ranging from $-1$ (perfect synergy, e.g. $Y=X_1X_2$) to $0$ (independence) to $+1$ (perfect redundancy, $X_1 \\approx X_2$). The relative scaling of the L--shaped arms reveals feature dominance in which element consistently provides more information. Although computed only from pairwise measurements, higher--order interactions among three or more elements emerge naturally through consistent cross--pair relationships (e.g. AB, AC, BC). The method is metric--agnostic and broadly applicable to any domain where performance can be evaluated incrementally over non-repeating element sequences, providing a unified geometric approach to uncovering interaction structure."}

Likelihood maximization drives this system toward nonequilibrium steady states with finite entropy production, reduced self-transition probabilities, and persistent probability currents in the latent space. These cycles are not imposed by the architecture but arise from training, and models that develop them avoid the low-log-likelihood regime associated with nearly reversible dynamics while more faithfully reproducing the empirical distribution of data classes. Compared with equilibrium approaches such as restricted Boltzmann machines, our model breaks the detailed balance between the forward and backward conditional transitions and relies on a log-likelihood gradient that depends explicitly on the last two steps of the Markov chain. Hence, this exploration of the interface between nonequilibrium statistical physics and modern machine learning suggests that introducing irreversibility into latent-variable models can enhance generative performance."}

Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies.

Using an autoencoder neural network architecture on data from $L$-site Fermi-Hubbard models, we identify minimal latent spaces with a sharp reconstruction quality threshold at $L-1$ latent dimensions, matching the system's intrinsic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the use of the trained decoder as a differentiable variational ansatz to minimize energy directly within the latent space. Crucially, this approach circumvents the $N$-representability problem, as the learned manifold implicitly restricts the optimization to physically valid quantum states."}
