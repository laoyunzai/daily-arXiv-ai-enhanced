We study this effect using\ntensor-networks and Pauli-propagation-based classical surrogates. Our study\nexamines the use of IQP circuits, matchcircuits, Heisenberg-chain circuits, and\nHaldane-chain circuits for the QCBM ansatz. In doing so, we derive closed-form\nexpressions for Pauli propagation in IQP circuits and the dynamical Lie algebra\nof the Haldane chain, which may be of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
