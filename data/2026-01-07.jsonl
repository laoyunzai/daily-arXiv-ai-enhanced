Through large-scale simulations (clusters up to $N = 10^6$ particles) in two dimensions, we perform a tripartite analysis: (1) We establish a definitive finite-size scaling collapse, extracting the universal fractal dimension $D = 1.712 \\pm 0.015$ and identifying the crossover to boundary-dominated growth at a scaled mass $x_0 \\approx 0.10 \\pm 0.02$.

This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\\leq 2$. We further construct a realistic Lindbladian for a spin-1 chain whose no-click dynamics are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian realizing the CCFT.

Instead, the charge diffusion constant is a discontinuous function of noise, which (in the weak-noise limit) depends only on the ratio of momentum and energy relaxation rates. In the special limit of momentum-conserving noise (e.g., spatially uniform fluctuations of the Hamiltonian), the diffusion constant diverges in the presence of noise. We describe the resulting superdiffusion in terms of coupled Burgers equations. We present a general mechanism--hydrodynamic recoupling--by which weak noise can induce singular changes in transport coefficients.

They have achieved striking progress, but almost all of this progress lives in virtual spaces. These systems transform embeddings and tokens, yet do not themselves touch the world and rarely admit a physical interpretation. In this work we propose a physical transformer that couples modern transformer style computation with geometric representation and physical dynamics. At the micro level, attention heads, and feed-forward blocks are modeled as interacting spins governed by effective Hamiltonians plus non-Hamiltonian bath terms. At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure. More broadly, the framework suggests a path toward physical AI that unify digital reasoning with physically grounded manifolds, opening a route to more interpretable and potentially unified models of reasoning, control, and interaction with the real world."}

We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework.

We test these predictions in a controllable aeroacoustic self oscillator, i.e, a whistle, that exhibits a robust limit cycle and is subject to external acoustic forcing with programmable frequency and amplitude modulation. Under both slowly varying frequency or amplitude of the forcing, three regimes are observed: (i) strict synchronization (ii) intermittent synchronization, characterized by alternating phase locking and brief phase slip episodes and (iii) no synchronization, with regular phase slips.

While ground states at integer fillings are typically identified as quantum Hall ferromagnets within a Hartree-Fock framework, we propose the existence of symmetric topological Mott insulators (STMIs) that transcend this Slater determinant picture. Focusing on half-filling of each flavor per unit cell, we demonstrate the existence of STMIs which exhibit a quantized charge or spin Hall response. We first establish this phase in a bilayer Haldane-Hubbard model with localized orbitals on the $A$ sublattice and dispersive band on the $B$ sublattice. Starting from a trivial Mott insulator on the $A$ sublattice, tuning the sublattice potential drives a Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) transition of the associated $p-\\mathrm{i}p$ exciton pairing, realizing a topological Mott insulator with $C=1$ per flavor. We further generalize this construction to a single-layer spinful model, where the resulting STMI hosts charge edge modes coexisting with bulk local moments. A Mott semimetal is identified at the quantum critical point between the STMI and the trivial Mott insulator.

A key result is that the number of required bases is provably small: K=1 suffices in one-dimensional continua (and on lattices in any dimension), K=2 suffices in two dimensions, and in higher dimensions K grows at most linearly with particle number. The antisymmetric bases can be learned by small neural networks, while the symmetric factors are implemented by permutation-invariant networks whose width scales only linearly with particle number.

In the context of spin systems, it represents the population of the sublevels of the magnetization in the $z$-direction. We use this quantity to probe the onset of thermalization in the isolated quantum and classical one-dimensional spin-1 Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields. Thermalization is achieved when the long-time average of the occupation number converges to the microcanonical prediction as the chain length $L$ increases, consistent with the emergence of ergodicity. However, the finite-size scaling analysis in the quantum model is challenged by the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with $L$. To overcome this limitation, we turn to the corresponding classical model, which enables access to much larger system sizes. By tracking the dynamics of individual spins on their three-dimensional Bloch spheres and employing tools from random matrix theory, we establish a quantitative criterion for classical ergodicity in interacting spin systems. We find that deviations from classical ergodicity decay algebraically with system size. This power-law scaling then provides a quantitative bound on the approach to thermal equilibrium in the quantum model."}

We analyze a memory-assisted quantum clock interferometer in which a frequency-bin photonic clock is stored in two vertically separated quantum memories for a controllable duration, such that the joint state evolves in a quantum superposition of two proper times. After retrieval, the photonic modes interfere in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer, for which we derive analytic expressions for the resulting multiphoton detection statistics. Extending this HOM-based scheme from entangled photon pairs to frequency-entangled 2N-photon inputs, we show that the proper-time dependent phase is amplified by a factor N, leading to an N-times faster collapse and revival of the interference signal compared with the two-photon case. Incorporating finite memory efficiency and lifetime, we identify regimes where this modulation remains observable. For parameters compatible with demonstrated Rb and Cs memories and achievable optical frequency separations, the first collapse occurs for height differences in the order of 10-100 m with subsecond to few-second storage times, while suitable rare-earth ion and alkali memory combinations can reduce the required height to the few-metre scale.

Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement.

Ho$_2$GaSbO$_7$ contains only Ga$^{3+}$/Sb$^{5+}$ charge disorder, whereas Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$ exhibits both charge and substantial size disorder arising from the large ionic-radius mismatch between Sc$^{3+}$ and Sb$^{5+}$. Although both materials retain the pyrochlore structure, neutron scattering measurements reveal a reduced correlation length for the $R/B$-site cation ordering and enhanced local structural distortions in Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$. Despite these structural differences, bulk thermodynamic measurements and magnetic diffuse scattering demonstrate that both systems exhibit the defining signatures of a dipolar spin-ice state. Low-energy inelastic neutron spectroscopy further uncovers broad magnetic excitations that develop within the dipolar spin-ice regime, a feature absent in pristine Ho pyrochlores and indicative of disorder-induced splitting of the non-Kramers ground-state doublet. Together, these results show that controlled disorder generates tunable transverse-field-driven quantum fluctuations in Ho-based pyrochlores, although the dipolar spin-ice state is remarkably robust to this disorder."}

These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution. Our analysis only requires mild and standard curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold. The main ingredients in our analysis are Li-Yau estimate for the log-gradient of heat kernel, and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion of the perturbed heat equation. Our approach opens the door to a sharper analysis of diffusion models on non-Euclidean spaces."}

At finite temperature, if a polymer is shorter than its persistence length, the polymer is semiflexible, and its elasticity remains rod-like. But polymers can also stretch due to their finite extensibility, which can couple to energetically cheap bending deformations in nonlinear ways when a load is applied to the system. We show how the interplay between thermal fluctuations and nonlinear elasticity dramatically modifies the Euler buckling instability for compressed semiflexible polymers in a fixed strain ensemble. We identify a Ginzburg-like length scale beyond which thermally excited undulations lead to a softened Young's modulus, while the polymer nevertheless remains semiflexible. Both perturbative calculations and numerical Monte Carlo simulations suggest a qualitative change in several scaling properties of the buckling transition. The critical compressional strain for thermal buckling now increases with system size, in contrast to athermal buckling, where it decreases with system size. Renormalization group calculations confirm this picture, and also show that thermal buckling is controlled by a new fixed point with different critical exponents compared to classical Euler buckling."}

We frame infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem: when a query is unsatisfiable, the agent should relax the least important constraints to the user. We propose three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Experiments show local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation.

We show through numerical simulations that the new method resolves finer spectral features, while maintaining an order-of-magnitude speedup over conventional approaches to noise spectroscopy.

These measurements use pseudorandom pulse sequences that can be generated in real time from a short random seed, reducing experimental complexity without compromising reconstruction accuracy.

This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows.

By abruptly changing the trap stiffness, we measure the stochastic work, heat, and entropy produced during NESS-to-NESS transformations. We identify a state-dependent effective temperature that restores the second law for these transitions, enabling the definition of a generalized work that incorporates the consequence of the nonequilibrium fluctuations. With this quantity, we derive and experimentally verify a Crooks-like fluctuation relation linking work distributions to a nonequilibrium free-energy difference defined through the effective temperature. Finally, we establish a fluctuation-response relation for the positional variance following stiffness changes. We demonstrate that this relation is key to distinguishing systems that can be described by a unique effective temperature (i.e., those under equilibrium or white-noise conditions) from those under colored-noise, where an equilibrium-like response cannot be restored.

Prior work has shown that CAD can greatly improve maximal distances and noise tolerances of the practical decoy state protocol. However, past work in deriving key-rate bounds for this protocol with CAD have assumed a trivial bound on the quantum entropy, whenever Alice sends a vacuum state in a CAD block (i.e., the entropy of such blocks is taken to be zero). Since such rounds contribute, negatively, to the error correction leakage, this results in a correct, though sub-optimal bound. Here, we derive a new proof of security for CAD applied to the decoy state BB84 protocol, computing a bound on Eve's uncertainty in all possible single and vacuum photon events. We use this to derive a new asymptotic key-rate bound which, we show, outperforms prior work, allowing for increased distances and noise tolerances."}

For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines. Interpretability analysis confirms that our multi-scale causal serialization effectively drives attention toward cliff-determining differences."}

Moreover, we demonstrate that learning signals can be derived from user simulator behavior in MultiSessionCollab to train agents to generate more comprehensive reflections and update their memory more effectively.

This interaction enables a nontrivial interplay between topology and nonlinear dynamics in soliton pumping. In the weakly interacting regime, the ground-state soliton undergoes quantized Thouless pumping. At intermediate interaction strengths, soliton creation and annihilation break adiabaticity and disrupt quantized transport. In the strong-coupling regime, the coexistence of ground- and excited-state solitons leads to negligible coupling at energy crossings, giving rise to discrete time-translation symmetry breaking (DTTSB) in the soliton dynamics. Comparison of mean-field results with exact diagonalization along closed circular pumping paths confirms both the validity of the mean-field description and the robustness of DTTSB across different pumping trajectories. Our findings reveal how interaction-induced effects can fundamentally modify topological transport and suggest that these phenomena may be explored in cold-atom, photonic, and superconducting-circuit platforms."}

Our analysis reveals that quantum Cramér-Rao bound fails to provide a tight error bound for the two-parameter estimation involving the initial phase and weight parameters.

In this paper, we examine measurement using the Q-based, objective-field model for quantum mechanics. Schrodinger considered a microscopic system prepared in a superposition of states which is then coupled to a macroscopic meter. We analyze the entangled meter and system, and measurements on it, by solving forward-backward stochastic differential equations for real amplitudes $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ that correspond to the phase-space variables of the Q function of the system at a time $t$. We model the system and meter as single-mode fields, and measurement of $\\hat{x}$ by amplification of the amplitude $x(t)$. Our conclusion is that the outcome for the measurement is determined at (or by) the time $t_{m}$, when the coupling to the meter is complete, the meter states being macroscopically distinguishable. There is consistency with macroscopic realism. By evaluating the distribution of the amplitudes $x$ and $p$ postselected on a given outcome of the meter, we show how the $Q$-based model represents a more complete description of quantum mechanics: The variances associated with amplitudes $x$ and $p$ are too narrow to comply with the uncertainty principle, ruling out that the distribution represents a quantum state. We conclude that the collapse of the wavefunction occurs as a two-stage process: First there is an amplification that creates branches of amplitudes $x(t)$ of the meter, associated with distinct eigenvalues. The outcome of measurement is determined by $x(t)$ once amplified, explaining Born's rule. Second, the distribution that determines the final collapse is the state inferred for the system conditioned on the outcome of the meter: information is lost about the meter, in particular, about the complementary variable $p$."}

HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation.

This mapping enables a controlled Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbative treatment of the ground-state wavefunction and an explicit spectral analysis of the reduced density matrix. Working in the weak-screening regime, we compute the leading non-Gaussian correction arising from the quartic interaction $ρ^4$, which appears at order $α^2$ in the expansion of the Yukawa-like potential. We obtain closed analytic expressions for the resulting small eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix and evaluate their contribution to the von Neumann entanglement entropy.

In dipolar-octupolar (DO) pyrochlores, such as $\\text{Ce}_2\\text{Zr}_2\\text{O}_7$, the candidate $π$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI) state is predicted to host both gapless emergent photons and a continuum of spinons. However, resolving these modes at zero field is complicated by their spectral overlap and the presence of nonmagnetic scattering near zero energy. Here, we report neutron scattering experiments on $\\text{Ce}_2\\text{Zr}_2\\text{O}_7$ under a magnetic field along the $[1,1,1]$ direction. In contrast to previous unpolarized studies at zero-field that relied on high-temperature subtraction, we use a same-temperature high-field subtraction protocol to isolate the photon mode. Leveraging the selective coupling of the magnetic field to the dipolar degrees of freedom, we demonstrate the spectroscopic demarcation of these excitations. We observe that weak fields ($\\approx 0.15$ T) suppress the low-energy photon weight while leaving the high-energy spinon continuum robust, albeit hardened. Our results, supported by gauge mean-field theory and exact diagonalization calculations, provide strong evidence for the $π$-flux QSI state and introduce a powerful field-tuning protocol for investigating DO-QSLs."}

Similarly, in a Bell test using any given Bell inequality, the maximum violation achievable using quantum strategies respecting or disregarding a certain symmetry can be different. In this work, we focus on the symmetry involved in the exchange of parties and explore when we have to trade this symmetry for a lower-dimensional quantum strategy in achieving the maximal violation of given Bell inequalities. For the family of symmetric Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequalities, we provide evidence showing that there is no such trade-off. However, for several other Bell inequalities with a small number of dichotomic measurement settings, we show that symmetric quantum strategies in the minimal Hilbert space dimension can only lead to a suboptimal Bell violation. In other words, there exist symmetric Bell inequalities that can only be maximally violated by asymmetric quantum strategies of minimal dimension. In contrast, one can also find examples of asymmetric Bell inequalities that are maximally violated by symmetric correlations. The implications of these findings on the geometry of the set of quantum correlations and the possibility of performing self-testing therefrom are briefly discussed."}

Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale."}

However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations. This study establishes a foundational framework for the eventual deployment of such models on real quantum hardware and their extension to broader applications in petroleum engineering and geoscience."}

This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\\leq 2$. We further construct a realistic Lindbladian for a spin-1 chain whose no-click dynamics are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian realizing the CCFT. Since the CCFT vacuum is the eigenstate with the smallest decay rate, the system naturally relaxes under dissipative dynamics toward a CFT state, thus providing a route to preparing long-range entangled states through engineered dissipation."}

Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training."}

However, state-of-the-art Deep RL (DRL) algorithms typically require large training datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks. We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons. We empirically validate our methodology on challenging variants of gridworld environments, both in the fully observable and partially observable setting. We show improved performance over a state-of-the-art reward machine baseline."}

For quasi-one-dimensional fluids, we show that this symmetry-protected charge diffusion is not smoothly connected to the normal diffusion that arises when momentum conservation is broken by noise (or static impurities). Instead, the charge diffusion constant is a discontinuous function of noise, which (in the weak-noise limit) depends only on the ratio of momentum and energy relaxation rates. In the special limit of momentum-conserving noise (e.g., spatially uniform fluctuations of the Hamiltonian), the diffusion constant diverges in the presence of noise. We describe the resulting superdiffusion in terms of coupled Burgers equations. We present a general mechanism--hydrodynamic recoupling--by which weak noise can induce singular changes in transport coefficients.

The central idea is the inclusion of auxiliary angular frequencies that modulate the temporal evolution of composite states. These additional dynamical degrees of freedom act as coherence channels through which nonseparability is mediated.

GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF."}

To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities.

The entanglement entropy exhibits pronounced peaks and follows the logarithmic scaling law at the phase transition points, from which we extract the central charge $c=1$. We further investigate the entanglement spectrum to accurately distinguish the different topological phases. In addition, the coupling between zero and $π$ modes leads to characteristic splittings in the entanglement spectrum, signaling their hybridization under periodic driving. These results remain robust in non-Hermitian regimes and in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping, demonstrating the reliability and universality of entanglement entropy as a diagnostic for topological phase transitions."}

Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data."}

While recent approaches including ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine improve reasoning through iterative refinement and reflection, they often lack structured exploration of alternative solution paths and persistent learning across problems. We propose ReTreVal (Reasoning Tree with Validation), a hybrid framework that integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration, self-refinement, LLM-based critique scoring, and reflexion memory to enable bounded and validated multi-step reasoning. ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths. We evaluate ReTreVal against ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B as the underlying LLM, and demonstrate that ReTreVal consistently outperforms existing methods through its combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer."}

Mishra", "Ujjwal Sen"], "title": "Collective dynamics versus entanglement in quantum battery performance", "comment": "13 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "Identifying the physical origin of enhanced charging performance in many-body quantum batteries is a key challenge in quantum thermodynamics. We investigate whether improvements in stored energy and instantaneous charging power arise from genuine quantum correlations or from coherent collective dynamics that are not intrinsically quantum. We compare the time evolution of energetic quantities with a hierarchy of information-theoretic measures probing bipartite, tripartite, and further-partite correlations. Across different battery charger configurations, we find a consistent temporal ordering in which the instantaneous power peaks before the buildup of strong quantum correlations, indicating that peak charging is dominated by coherent transport, while entanglement and scrambling develop at later times. Furthermore, charging protocols based on k local interactions are examined under both unconstrained and norm-constrained (fair) settings, enabling a clear distinction between classical scaling effects and genuine collective enhancements. Increasing the interaction order or the participation number does not automatically translate into higher charging power. Instead, the performance is primarily dictated by how many particles actually become mutually correlated and contribute to entanglement. Fully collective interactions provide a genuine advantage because all particles participate coherently, whereas partially extended interaction schemes fail to monotonically increase the number of effectively interacting particles, and therefore do not guarantee improved charging efficiency."}

A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks."}

While machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely studied to enhance OPF solution speed and performance, their practical deployment faces two critical scaling questions: What is the minimum training data volume required for reliable results? How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF. We further identify the divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility and characterize the compute-optimal frontier.

The potential applications of this technology have been widely explored, and extensive research over the past decades has been dedicated to developing scalable quantum computers. However, the question of the energetic performance of quantum computation has only gained attention more recently, and its importance is now recognized. In fact, quantum computers can only be a viable alternative if their energy cost scales favorably, and some research has shown that there is even a potential quantum energy advantage. Rydberg atoms have emerged recently as one of the most promising platforms to implement a large-scale quantum computer, with significant advances made in recent years. This work aims at contributing first steps to understand the energy efficiency of this platform, namely by investigating the energy consumption of the different elements of a Rydberg atom quantum computer. First, an experimental implementation of the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm is analyzed, and an estimation of the energetic cost of executing this algorithm is calculated. Then, a potential scaling of the energy cost of performing the Quantum Fourier Transform with Rydberg atoms is derived. This analysis facilitates a comparison of the energy consumption of different elements within a Rydberg atom quantum computer, from the preparation of the atoms to the execution of the algorithm, and the measurement of the final state, enabling the evaluation of the energy expenditure of the Rydberg platform and the identification of potential improvements.

We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations.

Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations. By striking the right balance between precision and explainability, the proposed fuzzy network could enable hydraulic engineers to validate predicted leak locations, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies.

Here, we present a unified theoretical framework for the frequency principle (F-principle) that characterizes the training dynamics of both classical and quantum neural networks. Within this framework, we prove that quantum neural networks exhibit a spectral bias toward learning low-frequency components of target functions, mirroring the behavior observed in classical deep networks. We further analyze the impact of noise and show that, when single-qubit noise is applied after encoding-layer rotations and modeled as a Pauli channel aligned with the rotation axis, the Fourier component labeled by $\\boldsymbolω$ is suppressed by a factor $(1-2γ)^{\\|\\boldsymbolω\\|_1}$. This leads to exponential attenuation of high-frequency terms while preserving the learnability of low-frequency structure. In the same setting, we establish that the resulting noisy circuits admit efficient classical simulation up to average-case error. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: Quantum neural networks primarily learn low-frequency features during early optimization and maintain robustness against dephasing and depolarizing noise acting on the encoding layer. Our results provide a frequency-domain lens that unifies classical and quantum learning dynamics, clarifies the role of noise in shaping trainability, and guides the design of noise-resilient quantum neural networks."}

In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives.

In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation.

Inference is typically implemented with step-based simulation: each token decides to jump via independent Bernoulli (or categorical) draws at every discretization step. Under uniform-noise initialization, where self-correction requires multiple edits per position, these independent decisions induce substantial variance in both the number and timing of edits, leading to characteristic failure modes such as under-editing (residual noise) or over-editing (cascading unnecessary substitutions), decreasing reproducibility.\n  We propose Stratified Hazard Sampling (SHS), a drop-in and hyperparameter-free inference principle for any sampler that admits a stay-vs.-replace decomposition. SHS models per-token edits as events driven by cumulative hazard (CTMC) or cumulative jump mass (DTMC) and places events by stratifying this cumulative quantity: with a single random phase per position, a token jumps whenever its accumulated hazard crosses unit-spaced thresholds. This preserves the expected number of jumps while achieving the minimum possible variance among unbiased integer estimators (bounded by 1/4), without altering per-jump destination sampling and thus retaining multimodality.

Nonlinear models, on the other hand, can improve forecasting accuracy with a surge in computational costs. We propose a novel multivariate neural network approach that combines linear and nonlinear feed-forward neural structures. Unlike previous hybrid models, our approach integrates online learning and forecast combination for efficient training and accuracy improvement. It also incorporates all relevant characteristics, particularly the fundamental relationships arising from wind and solar generation, electricity demand patterns, related energy fuel and carbon markets, in addition to autoregressive dynamics and calendar effects. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark models, the proposed forecasting method significantly reduces computational cost while delivering superior forecasting accuracy (12-13% RMSE and 15-18% MAE reductions).

This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\\leq 2$.

Although large-scale models provide effective solutions for perception and reasoning, their practical deployment on assistive devices is severely constrained by excessive memory consumption and high inference costs. Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios. While verifying the effectiveness of RPIQ for deployment in real assistive systems, this study also advances the computational efficiency and reliability of large models, enabling them to provide visually impaired users with the required information accurately and rapidly."}

While existing production systems excel at holistic route-level dependency modeling, they struggle to capture city-scale traffic dynamics and long-tail scenarios, leading to unreliable predictions in large urban networks. In this paper, we propose \\model, a scalable and adaptive framework that synergistically integrates link-level modeling with industrial route-level TTE systems. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal external attention module to capture global traffic dynamic dependencies across million-scale road networks efficiently. Moreover, we construct a stabilized graph mixture-of-experts network to handle heterogeneous traffic patterns while maintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, an asynchronous incremental learning strategy is tailored to enable real-time and stable adaptation to dynamic traffic distribution shifts.

Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale."}

We address this by placing a code-oriented LLM within a closed-loop synthesis framework, analyzing its evolution over 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles. The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator. The valid generation rate stabilizes at 50.6 percent (peaking at 74.5 percent), while mean first-epoch accuracy rises from 28.06 percent to 50.99 percent, and the fraction of candidates exceeding 40 percent accuracy grows from 2.04 percent to 96.81 percent. Analyses confirm the model moves beyond replicating existing motifs, synthesizing 455 high-performing architectures absent from the original corpus. By grounding code synthesis in execution feedback, this work provides a scalable blueprint for transforming stochastic generators into autonomous, performance-driven neural designers, establishing that LLMs can internalize empirical, non-textual rewards to transcend their training data."}

Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training."}

We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning. In synthetic and real-data experiments, our method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while greatly reducing the set size compared with naively applying max-p aggregation to single-source conformity scores, and can be comparable in size to single-source prediction sets with popular, standard conformity scores."}

A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks."}

In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives.

In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -the prompt- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability."}

Active query selection narrows these intervals to reduce estimation error.

We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task- specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage. These results demonstrate that verifier-guided latent adaptation provides an effective and scalable mechanism for controlling reasoning efficiency without sacrificing solution quality.

This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards. By integrating ergonomic structure with transformer-based linguistic reasoning, MyoText advances the feasibility of seamless, wearable neural input for future ubiquitous computing environments."}

We propose Time-Aware Synthetic Control (TASC), which employs a state-space model with a constant trend while preserving a low-rank structure of the signal. TASC uses the Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother: it first fits a generative time-series model with expectation-maximization and then performs counterfactual inference. We evaluate TASC on both simulated and real-world datasets, including policy evaluation and sports prediction. Our results suggest that TASC offers advantages in settings with strong temporal trends and high levels of observation noise."}

In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models.

Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware \"nextprompt\" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation. PersonaLedger offers a realistic, privacy preserving resource that supports rigorous evaluation of forecasting and anomaly detection models.

In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -the prompt- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability."}

RATS implements multiple augmentation methods spanning basic transformations, frequency-domain operations and time warping techniques, all accessible through a unified pipeline interface with built-in parallelisation.

While it enhances the generalization capabilities by suppressing high-frequency noise, it can be a limitation in scientific tasks that require capturing fine-scale structures. The delayed generalization phenomenon known as grokking is another barrier to rapid training of neural networks. Grokking has been hypothesized to arise as learning transitions from the NTK to the feature-rich regime. This paper explores the impact of preconditioned gradient descent (PGD), such as Gauss-Newton, on spectral bias and grokking phenomena. We demonstrate through theoretical and empirical results how PGD can mitigate issues associated with spectral bias. Additionally, building on the rich learning regime grokking hypothesis, we study how PGD can be used to reduce delays associated with grokking. Our conjecture is that PGD, without the impediment of spectral bias, enables uniform exploration of the parameter space in the NTK regime. Our experimental results confirm this prediction, providing strong evidence that grokking represents a transitional behavior between the lazy regime characterized by the NTK and the rich regime. These findings deepen our understanding of the interplay between optimization dynamics, spectral bias, and the phases of neural network learning."}

In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, existing MOO methods typically treat all hyperparameters as equally important, overlooking that hyperparameter importance (HPI) can vary significantly depending on the trade-off between objectives. We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization. For this, we leverage the objective weightings naturally produced by the MOO algorithm ParEGO and adapt the configuration space by fixing the unimportant hyperparameters, allowing the search to focus on the important ones. Eventually, we validate our method with diverse tasks from PyMOO and YAHPO-Gym. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in convergence speed and Pareto front quality compared to baselines."}

To address this gap, we introduce VC-IFEval, a new benchmark accompanied by a systematically constructed dataset that evaluates MLLMs' instruction-following ability under multimodal settings. Our benchmark systematically incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design, enabling a more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of how well MLLMs align their outputs with both visual input and textual instructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning MLLMs on our dataset, we achieve substantial gains in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence.

We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards.

Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems."}

However, TURTLE assumes clusters are balanced; when data is imbalanced, it yields non-ideal hyperplanes that cause higher clustering error. We propose PET-TURTLE, which generalizes the cost function to handle imbalanced data distributions by a power law prior. Additionally, by introducing sparse logits in the labeling process, PET-TURTLE optimizes a simpler search space that in turn improves accuracy for balanced datasets.

We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way."}

We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks.
