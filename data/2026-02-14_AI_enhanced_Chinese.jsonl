However, a concrete microscopic route for its realization remains elusive. In this work, we propose van der Waals heterostructures of stripe antiferromagnets (sAFMs) as an ideal platform for electrically controllable $p$-wave magnetism. In the sAFM/metal/sAFM structure, the leading RKKY-type exchange interaction is canceled due to the symmetry of the stacking pattern. This exposes a higher-order biquadratic interaction as a dominant contribution that drives a filling-controlled transition from a collinear phase to an orthogonal $p$-wave configuration. The resulting $p$-wave phase exhibits a gate-tunable Edelstein response, which originates from magnetic symmetry breaking rather than conventional relativistic spin-momentum locking and remains robust even under substantial spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we propose material candidates for the realization of our theory. Our results establish van der Waals heterostructures as a practical platform for non-relativistic spintronics with electric control of odd-parity spin textures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u53ef\u63a7p\u6ce2\u78c1\u6027\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5806\u53e0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6291\u5236RKKY\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9ad8\u9636\u53cc\u4e8c\u6b21\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5947\u5b87\u79f0\u81ea\u65cb\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u53d8\u673a\u5236", "motivation": "\u5947\u5b87\u79f0\u78c1\u6027\u867d\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u88c2\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5fae\u89c2\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1sAFM/\u91d1\u5c5e/sAFM\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5806\u53e0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u62b5\u6d88\u4e3b\u5bfcRKKY\u4ea4\u6362\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u9ad8\u9636\u53cc\u4e8c\u6b21\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6548\u5e94", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u586b\u5145\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u987a\u5217\u76f8-p\u6ce2\u6b63\u4ea4\u76f8\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0cp\u6ce2\u76f8\u4ea7\u751f\u78c1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u7f3a\u8d77\u6e90\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u53ef\u8c03Edelstein\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5f3a\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5947\u5b87\u79f0\u81ea\u65cb\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u7535\u5b66\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848"}}

Starting from a modified point-kinetics model with two perfectly-mixed volumes, we derive equivalent discrete-event dynamics and an It\u00f4 stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. Two solvers are implemented: an analog Monte Carlo (AMC) engine and a semi-implicit Milstein SDE solver. Transient benchmarks demonstrate perfect agreement of AMC/SDE means with deterministic solutions, while revealing that the SDE approach underestimates DNP variances in selected regimes, potentially due to the neglect of DNP noise. We further recast reactivity loss due to precursor drift in this stochastic setting and show that its estimator is negatively biased. Overall, the developed framework provides a minimal yet representative model for CFR low-population kinetics. Future work will re-derive and test SDE noise terms and apply the framework to selected transient applications such as start-up analyses of CFRs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The classification has an explicit criterion. In (2), we discover new P-time computable eight-vertex models on planar graphs beyond Kasteleyn's algorithm for counting planar perfect matchings. They are obtained by a combinatorial transformation to the planar {\\sc Even Coloring} problem followed by a holographic transformation to the tractable cases in the planar six-vertex model.
