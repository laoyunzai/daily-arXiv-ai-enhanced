Such a state corresponds to a strategy adopted by the population such that a rare mutant strategy cannot invade the population. In parallel, the dynamical formulation of evolutionary game theory -- particularly through replicator dynamics embodying the tenet of survival of the fittest -- provides a framework for modelling frequency-dependent selection over time. While it is well known that an ESS corresponds to stable fixed point in replicator dynamics, the evolutionary game-theoretic characterization of limit cycles is unknown. Here we fill this lacuna by defining oscillatory ESS (OESS) which we prove to be a stable limit cycle. We also show when an OESS is unique and if there are multiple OESSes, then what their locations are in the phase space."}

Achieving controllable stability and transitions between distinct topological structures is crucial for practical implementations. In this work, we investigate the effect of uniaxial mechanical strain on a magnetic model on the kagome lattice, focusing on skyrmion stability and emergent topological phases. To this end, we consider a Heisenberg model that includes exchange interactions and both in-plane and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Using a combination of Spin-Lattice Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore uniaxial strain variations in the range of $-10\\%$ to $10\\%$, showing important effects on the phase diagram. For compressive strain, we find that the density of skyrmions in the skyrmion gas (SkG) phase can be tuned and that the stability of this phase extends to higher temperatures. Tensile strain, in contrast, reduces the number of skyrmions and promotes transitions to other magnetic states. Within this regime, strain levels of about ($\\sim4-6\\%$) lead to a change in topological charge, turning skyrmions ($Q=-1$) into antiskyrmions ($Q=+1$). We also examine how strain affects other phases commonly appearing in skyrmion-hosting systems, such as the helical and fully polarized states, showing that mechanical deformation alters their stability and characteristic properties. Finally, we compare these results with the strain response of a more conventional skyrmion model, in order to clarify the role of the different interactions involved. Our results identify strain as an experimentally accessible route for engineering topological spin textures."}

Yet, how macroscopic coherence emerges from locally collapsed pairing remains elusive. Here, using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we report the impurity-induced pair breaking in an excitonic insulator Ta2Pd3Te5. Individual Te vacancies are found to generate a pair of spectral peaks within the excitonic gap. Their energies depend sensitively on the defect configurations and are continuously tunable by tip electric field, indicating controllable impurity scatterings. Spectral mapping shows spatially anisotropic and electronically coupled electron-hole components of the subgap states. These observations, together with mean-field modelling, suggest an excitonic pair-breaking origin. In the strongly electron-hole imbalanced region, a secondary pair-breaking effect, manifesting as an additional pair of subgap states with distinctly lower energies, can emerge, presenting the interplay of pairing breakings with different excitonic order parameters. Our findings demonstrate the spectroscopic 'fingerprint' of local excitonic depairing at the atomic level, offering a crucial clue to the critical behavior across excitonic condensation."}

To address this, we investigate emergent dynamical behaviors in a wheel network of Rössler and Lorenz oscillators that incorporates both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions under three coupling schemes, namely, diffusive, conjugate, and mean-field diffusive coupling. Our numerical analysis reveals four distinct collective behaviors: synchronization, desynchronization, chimera states, and synchronized clusters. To systematically classify these dynamical behaviors, we introduce two statistical measures that effectively capture synchronization patterns among arbitrarily positioned nodes. Applying these measures across all dynamical models and coupling schemes (six different models in total), we show that both pairwise and higher-order interactions crucially influence the emergence and robustness of chimera states. We observe that under pairwise interaction alone, chimera states appear with high prevalence in specific coupling ranges, though the robustness depends on both the coupling scheme and the underlying dynamical system. Incorporation of higher-order interactions reveals that the higher-order interaction underlying diffusive coupling enhances chimera states in both Rössler and Lorenz networks; under conjugate coupling, it strengthens chimera states in Lorenz but instead promotes full synchronization in Rössler; and under mean-field diffusive coupling, higher-order interactions generally favor synchronization, particularly for Rössler oscillators, but promote chimera in the Lorenz system for the intermediate range of its strengths. Overall, our results demonstrate that higher-order interactions can significantly modulate, promote, or suppress chimera states depending on the coupling mechanism and oscillator dynamics."}

In epilepsy-surgery patients, these hubs have traditionally been associated with the resection area (RA): the region removed during the surgery with the goal of stopping the seizures, and which is typically used as a proxy for the epileptogenic zone. However, recent studies hypothesize that pathological hubs may extend to the vicinity of the RA, potentially complicating post-surgical seizure control. Here we propose a neighbourhood-based analysis of brain organization to investigate this hypothesis. We exploit a large dataset of pre-surgical magnetoencephalography-derived whole-brain networks from 91 epilepsy-surgery patients. Our neighbourhood focus is 2-fold. Firstly, we propose a partition of the brain regions into three sets, namely resected nodes, their neighbours and the remaining network nodes. Secondly, we introduce generalized centrality metrics that describe the neighbourhood of each node, providing a regional measure of hubness. Our analyses reveal that both the RA and its neighbourhood present large hub status, but with significant variability across patients. For some, hubs appear in the RA; for others, in its neighbourhood. Moreover, this variability does not correlate with surgical outcome. These results highlight the potential of neighbourhood-based analyses to uncover novel insights into brain connectivity in brain pathologies, and the need for individualized studies, with large enough cohorts, that account for patient-specific variability."}

Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data.

Despite recent empirical evidence that horizon reduction can improve scaling on challenging offline RL benchmarks, its theoretical implications remain underdeveloped (Park et al., 2025). In this paper, we show that horizon reduction can induce fundamental and irrecoverable information loss in offline RL. We formalize horizon reduction as learning from fixed-length trajectory segments and prove that, under this paradigm and any learning interface restricted to fixed-length trajectory segments, optimal policies may be statistically indistinguishable from suboptimal ones even with infinite data and perfect function approximation. Through a set of minimal counterexample Markov decision processes (MDPs), we identify three distinct structural failure modes: (i) prefix indistinguishability leading to identifiability failure, (ii) objective misspecification induced by truncated returns, and (iii) offline dataset support and representation aliasing. Our results establish necessary conditions under which horizon reduction can be safe and highlight intrinsic limitations that cannot be overcome by algorithmic improvements alone, complementing algorithmic work on conservative objectives and distribution shift that addresses a different axis of offline RL difficulty (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020; Gulcehre et al., 2020)."}

We systematically identify all generalized symmetry operators by extracting conserved currents from the equations of motion. Two distinct classes of currents emerge: type-I currents, which generate invertible higher-form symmetries, and type-II currents, which give rise to non-invertible higher-form symmetries. The non-invertibility originates from projectors accompanying the symmetry operators, which restrict admissible gauge-field configurations. We further analyze the fusion rules of these symmetries, showing that invertible symmetries admit inverses, while non-invertible symmetries fuse through multiple channels. Finally, we study mixed anomalies among these generalized symmetries by simultaneously coupling multiple currents to proper types of background gauge fields and examining their gaugeability.

Despite their key role in the ergodic theory approach to fluid turbulence, identifying UPOs is challenging for two reasons: chaotic dynamics and the high-dimensionality of the spatial discretization. We address both issues at once by proposing a loop convergence algorithm for UPOs directly within a low-dimensional embedding of the chaotic attractor. The convergence algorithm circumvents time-integration, hence avoiding instabilities from exponential error amplification, and operates on a latent dynamics obtained by pulling back the physical equations using automatic differentiation through the learned embedding function. The interpretable latent dynamics is accurate in a statistical sense, and, crucially, the embedding preserves the internal structure of the attractor, which we demonstrate through an equivalence between the latent and physical UPOs of both a model PDE and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. This allows us to exploit the collapse of high-dimensional dissipative systems onto a lower dimensional manifold, and identify UPOs in the low-dimensional embedding."}

To build intuition, the first models the random walk of classical, non-interacting point-like particles, providing a clear analogy to the way disorder can limit transport. The second examines the propagation of an electromagnetic pulse through a one-dimensional, lossless transmission line with randomly varying propagation constant and characteristic impedance along its length, a system that captures the interference effects essential for true Anderson localization. We evaluate quantitative measures that reveal the transition from normal diffusion to localization of particles in one case, and the exponential confinement of wave energy in the other. Together, these simulations offer a pair of accessible tools for investigating localization phenomena in an instructional setting."}

This study introduces the Intrinsic-Metric Physics-Informed Neural Network (IM-PINN), a mesh-free geometric deep learning framework that solves partial differential equations directly in the continuous parametric domain. By embedding the Riemannian metric tensor into the automatic differentiation graph, our architecture analytically reconstructs the Laplace-Beltrami operator, decoupling solution complexity from geometric discretization. We validate the framework on a \"Stochastic Cloth\" manifold with extreme Gaussian curvature fluctuations ($K \\in [-2489, 3580]$), where traditional adaptive refinement fails to resolve anisotropic Turing instabilities. Using a dual-stream architecture with Fourier feature embeddings to mitigate spectral bias, the IM-PINN recovers the \"splitting spot\" and \"labyrinthine\" regimes of the Gray-Scott model. Benchmarking against the Surface Finite Element Method (SFEM) reveals superior physical rigor: the IM-PINN achieves global mass conservation error of $\\mathcal{E}_{mass} \\approx 0.157$ versus SFEM's $0.258$, acting as a thermodynamically consistent global solver that eliminates mass drift inherent in semi-implicit integration.

The traditional machine learning models are effective in pattern recognition, but do not have the adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy needed in modern financial operations. As a proposal, this paper presents an Agentic AI framework, or a system where AI agents view the world of dynamic credit independent of human observers, who then make actions based on their articulable decision-making paths. The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles. Findings indicate that decision speed, transparency and responsiveness is better than traditional credit scoring models. Nevertheless, there are still some practical limitations such as risks of model drift, inconsistencies in interpreting high dimensional data and regulatory uncertainties as well as infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings. The suggested system has a high prospective to transform credit analytics and future studies ought to be directed on dynamic regulatory compliance mobilizers, new agent teamwork, adversarial robustness, and large-scale implementation in cross-country credit ecosystems."}

By applying a linear Stark potential selectively to one sublattice of a dimerized chain, we generate an effective Hamiltonian with unbounded, staggered hopping amplitudes. The unbounded nature of the hopping places the model outside the scope of the Simon-Spencer theorem, while the staggered scaling allows it to evade broader constraints on Jacobi matrices. We analytically derive the bulk spectrum in reciprocal space, identifying a sharp ME where the energy magnitude equals the inter-cell hopping strength. This edge separates a continuum of extended states from two distinct localized branches: a standard unbounded Wannier-Stark ladder and an anomalous bounded branch accumulating at the ME. The existence of extended states is supported by finite-size scaling of the inverse participation ratio up to system sizes $L \\sim 10^9$. Furthermore, we propose an experimental realization using photonic frequency synthetic dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that the ME is robust against potential experimental imperfections, including frequency detuning errors and photon loss, establishing a practical path for observing MEs in disorder-free systems."}

To date, efficiency limitations have prevented scaling quantum dot-based interference to the coalescence of more than two photons at a single beamsplitter. We overcome this limitation by combining a state-of-the-art quantum dot source with deterministic demultiplexing, enabling the direct observation of quantum interference fringes arising from up to four photons. We measure high mean interference contrasts of $93.0 \\pm 0.1~\\%$ for two photons, and $84.1 \\pm 1.0~\\%$ for four photons, with the complex fringe structure fully reproduced by a theoretical model. These results reveal the existence of \"deep fringes\" whose minima are unaffected by distinguishable photons, rendering the maximum contrast of four-photon interference highly sensitive to multi-photon emission but robust against photon distinguishability. We predict that these phenomena will extend to interference of larger numbers of photons, with relevance across a range of potential optical quantum technologies. A Fisher information analysis demonstrates that interference fringes from our source can exhibit phase sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, illustrating potential applications in quantum metrology."}

An offline logged dataset is constructed from SQuAD 2.0 by executing each action and recording accuracy, token cost, hallucination/refusal indicators, and an SLO-weighted reward. Two simple policy-learning objectives are evaluated: supervised classification of the per-state best action (Argmax-CE) and a reward-weighted variant (Argmax-CE-WT). Across the evaluated settings, a strong fixed baseline (low k, guarded prompting) performs competitively; learned policies mainly provide additional cost savings under a quality-focused SLO and can exhibit refusal collapse under a cheap SLO when refusal is heavily rewarded.

This Anderson pseudospin description captures the coherent nonequilibrium dynamics of the coupled electron-lattice system. Numerical simulations reveal three distinct dynamical regimes of the CDW order parameter following a quench-locked oscillations, Landau-damped dynamics, and overdamped relaxation-closely paralleling quench dynamics in BCS superconductors and other electronically driven symmetry-breaking phases. Crucially, however, the presence of dynamical lattice degrees of freedom leads to qualitatively different long-time behavior. In particular, while the oscillation amplitude is reduced in the damped regimes, CDW oscillations do not fully decay but instead persist indefinitely due to feedback from the lattice field. We further show that these persistent oscillations are characterized by a nonequilibrium electronic distribution, which provides an intuitive understanding of both their amplitude and the renormalization of the oscillation frequency relative to the bare Holstein phonon frequency. Our results highlight the essential role of lattice dynamics in nonequilibrium ordered phases and establish a clear distinction between electron-lattice-driven CDW dynamics and their purely electronic counterparts."}

Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention.

This significantly generalizes the prior work by Ananth, Hu, and Yuen (ASIACRYPT'23) where they showed the same but only for the specific case of random oracles. Therefore, verifying black-box constructions of quantum money inherently requires coherently evaluating the underlying cryptographic tools, which may be difficult for near-term quantum devices."}

However, prior to absorption, the particle may undergo several rounds of surface attachment (adsorption), detachment (desorption) and diffusion. Alternatively, the surface may be stochastically gated so that absorption can only occur when the gate is open. In both cases one can view each return to the surface as a renewal event. In this paper we develop a renewal theory for stochastically gated FTP problems along analogous lines to previous work on adsorption/desorption processes. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation that relates the joint probability density for particle position and the state of a gate (or multiple gates) to the probability density and FPT density for a totally absorbing (non-gated) boundary. This essentially decomposes sample paths into an alternating sequence of bulk diffusion and instantaneous adsorption/desorption events, which is terminated when adsorption coincides with an open gate. Through a variety of examples, we show how renewal theory provides a general mathematical framework for incorporating stochastic gating into FTP problems."}

To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs."}

Using a two-dimensional array of superconducting qubits, we study an interacting spin model at finite temperature in a disordered landscape, tracking dynamics both in real space and in Hilbert space. Over a broad disorder range, we observe an intermediate non-ergodic regime with glass-like characteristics: physical observables become broadly distributed and some, but not all, degrees of freedom are effectively frozen. The Hilbert-space return probability shows slow power-law decay, consistent with finite-temperature quantum glassiness. In the same regime, we detect the onset of a finite Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the disappearance of spin diffusion. By contrast, at lower disorder, spin transport persists with a nonzero diffusion coefficient. Our results show that there is a transition out of the ergodic phase in two-dimensional systems."}

We first adapt Molchanov formula, originally employed in the study of Schrodinger operators on multidimensional integer lattice, to characterize the evolution of continuous time quantum walks. Extending this framework, we develop a probabilistic method to represent discrete time quantum walks on an infinite integer line, bypassing the locality constraints that typically inhibit direct application of Molchanov formula. The validity of our representation is empirically confirmed through a benchmark analysis of the Hadamard walk, demonstrating high fidelity with traditional unitary evolution. Our results suggest that this probabilistic lens offer a powerful alternative for learning multidimensional quantum walks and provides new analytical pathways for investigating quantum systems via classical stochastic processes."}

We identify and analyze several extensions of Jarzynski's inequality that go beyond its direct derivation from the Jarzynski equality. In particular, we consider chemical systems both in the linear-response regime and away from linear thermodynamics. Furthermore, by employing functional-integral techniques, we extend Jarzynski's inequality to many-body statistical systems described by quantum field theory. Salient issues, such as connections of the Jarzynski inequality with the maximum work theorem and the Landau--Lifshitz theory of fluctuations, are also discussed."}

We reframe inference as a control-plane decision problem: determining when execution is necessary versus when correctness can be preserved through alternative pathways. We introduce Meaning-First Execution (MFEE), a control-plane architecture implementing this framework, selectively invoking transformer inference only when required. MFEE operates as a gating layer above existing stacks without modifying models, weights, or parameters. Across 1,000 diverse prompts under deterministic decoding, MFEE achieves 78.1% execution reduction while maintaining 100% exact-match equivalence for invoked executions. Comparative evaluation reveals pattern-based routers achieve at most 53.3% avoidance with correctness failures, while MFEE reaches 100% avoidance with zero failures through semantic analysis. We prove this limitation via Theorem 1: any router operating solely on finite feature maps cannot simultaneously guarantee zero false skips and positive avoidance on feature-collision pairs. These results establish execution governance as a foundational layer in ML systems infrastructure, orthogonal to model-level optimization techniques."}

In this work, we systematically decompose self-correction into three distinct sub-capabilities: error detection, error localization, and error correction. Through cross-model experiments on GSM8K-Complex (n=500 per model, 346 total errors) with three major LLMs, we uncover a striking Accuracy-Correction Paradox: weaker models (GPT-3.5, 66% accuracy) achieve 1.6x higher intrinsic correction rates than stronger models (DeepSeek, 94% accuracy)--26.8% vs 16.7%. We propose the Error Depth Hypothesis: stronger models make fewer but deeper errors that resist self-correction. Error detection rates vary dramatically across architectures (10% to 82%), yet detection capability does not predict correction success--Claude detects only 10% of errors but corrects 29% intrinsically. Surprisingly, providing error location hints hurts all models. Our findings challenge linear assumptions about model capability and self-improvement, with important implications for the design of self-refinement pipelines."}

Phase~II appears for all field directions, although its transport response shows moderate directional dependence.

In this Letter, we introduce a powerful framework, termed multi-bipartition entanglement tomography, which probes the fine structure of entanglement across an exhaustive ensemble of distinct bipartitions. Our cornerstone is the discovery of a ``bond-additive law'', which reveals that the entanglement entropy can be precisely decomposed into a bulk volume-law baseline plus a geometric correction formed by a sum of local contributions from crossed bonds of varying ranges. This law distills complex entanglement landscapes into a concise set of entanglement bond tensions $\\{ω_j\\}$, serving as a quantitative fingerprint of interaction locality. By applying this tomography to Hamiltonian dynamics, random quantum circuits, and Floquet dynamics, we resolve a fundamental distinction between thermalization mechanisms: Hamiltonian thermalized states retain a persistent geometric imprint characterized by a significantly non-zero $ω_1$, while this structure is completely erased in random quantum circuit and Floquet dynamics. Our work establishes multi-bipartition entanglement tomography as a versatile toolbox for the geometric structure of quantum information in many-body systems."}

The protocol coherently transfers the multipartite W state in a single collective operation without populating higher excited atomic levels, thereby strongly suppressing decoherence. Numerical simulations based on the full Lindblad master equation, including realistic cavity dissipation, qutrit relaxation and dephasing, and inter-cavity crosstalk, show that a three-qubit cat-state W state can be transferred with a maximum fidelity of approximately $0.92$.

Furthermore, isolated dislocations, whose presence disrupts crystalline order, have energies of O(1) at some values of N, the number of particles in the system, and therefore will be thermally excited, raising questions about the applicability of standard KTHNY theory to the OCP, and supporting older suggestions that there are no phase transitions at all in the two-dimensional OCP."}

This suggests models see influential information but choose not to report it. Telling models they are being watched does not help. Forcing models to report hints works, but causes them to report hints even when none exist and reduces their accuracy. We also found that hints appealing to user preferences are especially dangerous-models follow them most often while reporting them least. These findings suggest that simply watching AI reasoning is not enough to catch hidden influences."}

The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\\langle Δ_{z}\\rangle/\\langleΔ_{x(y)}\\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings.

NV-QWOA is benchmarked against classical heuristics, the MaxMin Ant System (MMAS) and Greedy Local Search (GLS), as well as the Grover quantum search algorithm, which serves as a quantum baseline. Performance is evaluated using two metrics: the number of objective function evaluations and the number of algorithm iterations required to consistently reach optimal or near optimal solutions across QAP instances with 5 to 10 facilities. The motivation for this study stems from limitations of both classical exact methods and current quantum algorithms. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as QAOA and VQE, while widely studied, suffer from costly parameter tuning and barren plateaus that hinder convergence. By adopting a non-variational approach, this work explores a potentially more efficient and scalable quantum strategy for combinatorial optimisation. The results provide a direct comparative analysis between classical and quantum frameworks, characterising the average case performance of NV-QWOA.

A spin supersolid is characterized by the coexistence of longitudinal spin order that breaks lattice translational symmetry and transverse spin order associated with the spontaneous breaking of a spin U(1) symmetry. Extensive experimental investigations, together with advanced numerical studies, have now revealed a coherent and internally consistent picture of these phases, substantially deepening our understanding of supersolidity in quantum magnetic materials. Beyond their fundamental interest as exotic quantum states, potential applications in highly efficient demagnetization cooling have been supported by a giant magnetocaloric effect observed in candidate materials. Moreover, the possible dissipationless spin supercurrents could open promising perspectives for spin transport and spintronic applications. In this Review, we summarize recent progress on emergent spin supersolids in frustrated triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnets. We survey experimental evidence from thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements and compare these results with theoretical studies of minimal models addressing global phase diagrams, ground state properties, and collective excitations.

There is also a lack of comprehensive comparison between the AEF-based models and traditional remote sensing (RS)-based models under different scenarios, which could offer valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners. This study addresses some of these gaps by evaluating AEF embeddings in three agricultural downstream tasks in the U.S., including crop yield prediction, tillage mapping, and cover crop mapping. Datasets are compiled from both public and private sources to comprehensively evaluate AEF embeddings across tasks at different scales and locations, and RS-based models are trained as comparison models. AEF-based models generally exhibit strong performance on all tasks and are competitive with purpose-built RS-based models in yield prediction and county-level tillage mapping when trained on local data. However, we also find several limitations in current AEF embeddings, such as limited spatial transferability compared to RS-based models, low interpretability, and limited time sensitivity. These limitations recommend caution when applying AEF embeddings in agriculture, where time sensitivity, generalizability, and interpretability is important."}

Yu"], "title": "Enhancing Temporal Awareness in LLMs for Temporal Point Processes", "comment": "preprint", "summary": "Temporal point processes (TPPs) are crucial for analyzing events over time and are widely used in fields such as finance, healthcare, and social systems. These processes are particularly valuable for understanding how events unfold over time, accounting for their irregularity and dependencies. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in sequence modeling, applying them to temporal point processes remains challenging. A key issue is that current methods struggle to effectively capture the complex interaction between temporal information and semantic context, which is vital for accurate event modeling. In this context, we introduce TPP-TAL (Temporal Point Processes with Enhanced Temporal Awareness in LLMs), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to enhance temporal reasoning within LLMs. Rather than using the conventional method of simply concatenating event time and type embeddings, TPP-TAL explicitly aligns temporal dynamics with contextual semantics before feeding this information into the LLM. This alignment allows the model to better perceive temporal dependencies and long-range interactions between events and their surrounding contexts. Through comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, it is shown that TPP-TAL delivers substantial improvements in temporal likelihood estimation and event prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of enhancing temporal awareness in LLMs for continuous-time event modeling.

Magnetically, the system avoids long-range order down to 1.8 K and instead displays a T3/2 dependence in its inverse susceptibility, a hallmark of antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations.

Counterdiabatic terms can be expressed as truncated expansions of nested commutators of the adiabatic Hamiltonian and its parametric derivative. Here, we show how this algebraic structure can be efficiently realized in a digital-analog setting using commutator product formulas. Using native multi-qubit analog interactions augmented by local single-qubit rotations, this approach enables higher-order counterdiabatic protocols whose implementation requires a constant number of analog blocks for any fixed truncation order, independent of system size. We demonstrate the method for two-dimensional spin models and analyze the associated approximation errors. These results show that digital-analog quantum computing enables a qualitatively new resource scaling for counterdiabatic protocols and related quantum control primitives, with direct implications for quantum simulation, optimization, and algorithmic state preparation on current quantum devices."}

Integrating out the visions to second order in the Kondo coupling yields effective electron-electron interactions, including a local Hubbard repulsion, a spin-spin interaction whose sign depends on the Kitaev exchange, and a vertex coupling electrons to Majorana fermions. We analyze the resulting low-energy field theory using a perturbative renormalization group (RG) scheme, accounting for additional density-density interactions generated under RG. At criticality, electrons decouple from Majorana fermions but all three electron interactions acquire positive values. An analysis of susceptibility exponents reveals that the fractionalized Fermi liquid becomes unstable towards antiferromagnetic order and that superconductivity is disfavored."}

Using a reward based on the positive time derivative of the trace distance associated with the Breuer-Laine-Piilo measure, we train PPO and SAC agents and benchmark their performance against gradient-based optimal control theory (OCT). While OCT enhances a single dominant backflow peak, RL policies broaden this revival and activate additional contributions in later memory windows, producing sustained positive trace-distance growth over a longer duration. Consequently, the integrated non-Markovianity achieved by RL substantially exceeds that obtained with OCT. These results demonstrate how long-horizon, model-free learning naturally uncovers distributed-backflow strategies and highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for engineering memory effects in open quantum systems."}

Achieving controllable stability and transitions between distinct topological structures is crucial for practical implementations. In this work, we investigate the effect of uniaxial mechanical strain on a magnetic model on the kagome lattice, focusing on skyrmion stability and emergent topological phases. To this end, we consider a Heisenberg model that includes exchange interactions and both in-plane and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Using a combination of Spin-Lattice Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore uniaxial strain variations in the range of $-10\\%$ to $10\\%$, showing important effects on the phase diagram. For compressive strain, we find that the density of skyrmions in the skyrmion gas (SkG) phase can be tuned and that the stability of this phase extends to higher temperatures. Tensile strain, in contrast, reduces the number of skyrmions and promotes transitions to other magnetic states. Within this regime, strain levels of about ($\\sim4-6\\%$) lead to a change in topological charge, turning skyrmions ($Q=-1$) into antiskyrmions ($Q=+1$). We also examine how strain affects other phases commonly appearing in skyrmion-hosting systems, such as the helical and fully polarized states, showing that mechanical deformation alters their stability and characteristic properties. Finally, we compare these results with the strain response of a more conventional skyrmion model, in order to clarify the role of the different interactions involved.

These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints.

Consider the task of predicting the political preferences of users in a social network; to solve this task one should consider, both, the features of each individual user and the relationships between them. However, oftentimes one is not interested in the label of a single instance but rather in the distribution of labels over a set of instances; e.g., when predicting the political preferences of users, the overall prevalence of a given opinion might be of higher interest than the opinion of a specific person. This label prevalence estimation task is commonly referred to as quantification learning (QL). Current QL methods for tabular data are typically based on the so-called prior probability shift (PPS) assumption which states that the label-conditional instance distributions should remain equal across the training and test data. In the graph setting, PPS generally does not hold if the shift between training and test data is structural, i.e., if the training data comes from a different region of the graph than the test data. To address such structural shifts, an importance sampling variant of the popular adjusted count quantification approach has previously been proposed.

Recently, a framework was introduced aiming at extending the thermodynamic formalism to genuine quantum settings, also referred to as autonomous quantum systems: free from external controls, only quantum systems interacting with each other. In this paper, we apply such a thermodynamic framework to common experimental situations of interacting quantum systems. In situations where traditional frameworks detect only heat exchanges, the recent autonomous thermodynamic framework points at work exchanges based on two mechanisms: population inversion and coherence generation / consumption. Such mechanisms are well known in the literature for being related to work expenditure and extraction, in particular in relation with ergotropy, which emphasizes the relevance of the autonomous framework and the limitations of traditional ones. Furthermore, the autonomous framework also identifies a genuine non-unitary mechanism of work exchange related to athermality. %, also pointed out as a resource for work extraction. Finally, in the semi-classical limit, the autonomous framework identifies all energy exchanges as pure work, but distinguishes between local work and interaction energy.\n  Our results show that the autonomous framework provides a refined analysis of work exchange mechanisms in the quantum realm and serves as a consistent approach to analyze thermodynamic processes in realistic quantum devices."}

Despite extensive empirical observations, it remains unclear which features of degenerate ground states are preferentially sampled and why by QA. Here we analyze the final states using degenerate perturbation theory to characterize the preference among them. In this analysis, the adjacency matrix of the graph composed by the ground states naturally emerges, and we can predict the eigenvector centralities (one of the node centralities) are related to the probabilities of these states. We verify this prediction on toy models where degeneracy is lifted at first and second order, and we show that second-order weights encode local barrier information, relating sampling fairness to the flatness of the local energy landscape. Finally, this perspective suggests two practical routes toward fair sampling -- promoting connectivity of the graph and reducing heterogeneity of centralities -- and we illustrate consistency with higher-order drivers and minor-embedding transformations."}

In order to accurately represent structural systems, it is critical for capturing vibration phenomena and ensuring reliable predictive analysis. So, our investigations are crucial for gaining deeper insight into the robustness of scientific machine learning models for solving vibration problems.

We propose Counterfactual Self-Questioning, a framework in which a single language model generates and evaluates counterfactual critiques of its own reasoning. The method produces an initial reasoning trace, formulates targeted questions that challenge potential failure points, and generates alternative reasoning trajectories that expose incorrect assumptions or invalid steps. These counterfactual trajectories provide structured relative feedback that can be directly used for policy optimization without auxiliary models. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that counterfactual self-questioning improves accuracy and training stability, particularly for smaller models, enabling scalable self-improvement using internally generated supervision alone."}

In quantum information theory, the quantum mutual information, $I(A;B)$, is a measure of correlation between the subsystems $A,B$ in a quantum state, and is defined by the means of the von Neumann entropy: $I\\left(A;B\\right)=S\\left(ρ_{A}\\right)+S\\left(ρ_{B}\\right)-S\\left(ρ_{AB}\\right)$. However, such a computation requires an exponential amount of resources. This is a defining feature of quantum systems, the infamous ``curse of dimensionality'' . Other measures, which are based on Rényi divergences instead of von Neumann entropy, were suggested as alternatives in a recent paper showing them to possess important theoretical features, and making them leading candidates as mutual information measures. In this work, we concentrate on the maximal Rényi divergence. This measure can be shown to be the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. To calculate it efficiently for a 1D state represented as a matrix product state, we develop a generalized eigenvalue version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We benchmark our method for the paradigmatic XXZ chain, and show that the maximal Rényi divergence may exhibit different trends than the von Neumann mutual information."}

Our results indicate that excitations in any oscillator basically enhance the redistribution of correlations across the system. The mixing angle $θ$ governs entanglement intensity, ranging from separability to maximal correlation.

Long-lived correlation effects (non-Markovianity), system-environment hybridization, and the necessity for accuracy beyond the Born-Markov approximation form particular challenges. Approaches to meet these challenges have been introduced, originating from different fields, such as hierarchical equations of motion, Lindblad-pseudomode formulas, chain-mapping approaches, quantum Brownian motion master equations, stochastic unravelings, and refined quantum master equations. This diversity, while indicative of the field's relevance, has inadvertently led to a fragmentation that hinders cohesive advances and their effective cross-community application to current problems for complex systems.

We study ICL in a linear transformer with tied weights trained on linear regression tasks, and show that minimising the in-context loss leads to a phase transition in the learned parameters. Above a critical context length, the solution develops a skew-symmetric component. We prove this by reducing the forward pass of the linear transformer under weight tying to preconditioned gradient descent, and then analysing the optimal preconditioner. This preconditioner includes a skew-symmetric component, which induces a rotation of the gradient direction. For model collapse, we use martingale and random walk theory to analyse simplified settings - linear regression and Gaussian fitting - under both replacing and cumulative data regimes. We strengthen existing results by proving almost sure convergence, showing that collapse occurs unless the data grows sufficiently fast or is retained over time. Finally, we introduce the notion of context collapse: a degradation of context during long generations, especially in chain-of-thought reasoning. This concept links the dynamics of ICL with long-term stability challenges in generative models."}

Despite its importance, analytical results for coupled three-body oscillators remain scarce. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon through a geometrical diagonalization approach, which reduces the degrees of freedom associated with the system's steering properties. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for quantum steering in all possible directions using the Wigner function framework, as it provides a complete description of the system's quantum state. Our results indicate that excitations significantly enhance quantum steering across the system; this stands in contrast to the ground state $(0,0,0)$, which exhibits no steerable correlations. Furthermore, both the directionality and topology of these correlations are governed by the spatial distribution of the excitations rather than their magnitude. We also observe symmetric steering behavior between oscillators $x$, $y$, and $z$ under equivalent excitation conditions, which can be formalized as $S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\\to z}(θ)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\\to y}(-θ),\\quad S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\\to x}(θ)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\\to x}(-θ)$, and $S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\\to z}(θ)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\\to y}(-θ)$.

High-quality simulated measurements were used to create a balanced binary classification dataset using three features: reactive power at DG1, frequency deviation relative to the nominal value, and terminal voltage magnitude. Classical machine learning baselines, fully quantum variational classifiers, and hybrid quantum classical models were evaluated. The results show that a hybrid quantum classical model combining quantum feature embeddings with a classical RBF support vector machine achieves the best overall performance on this low dimensional dataset, with a modest improvement in accuracy and F1 score over a strong classical SVM baseline. Fully quantum models perform worse due to training instability and limitations of current NISQ hardware. In contrast, hybrid models train more reliably and demonstrate that quantum feature mapping can enhance intrusion detection even when fully quantum learning is not yet practical."}

Using a two-dimensional array of superconducting qubits, we study an interacting spin model at finite temperature in a disordered landscape, tracking dynamics both in real space and in Hilbert space. Over a broad disorder range, we observe an intermediate non-ergodic regime with glass-like characteristics: physical observables become broadly distributed and some, but not all, degrees of freedom are effectively frozen. The Hilbert-space return probability shows slow power-law decay, consistent with finite-temperature quantum glassiness. In the same regime, we detect the onset of a finite Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the disappearance of spin diffusion. By contrast, at lower disorder, spin transport persists with a nonzero diffusion coefficient. Our results show that there is a transition out of the ergodic phase in two-dimensional systems."}

This paper presents LLMize, an open-source Python framework that enables LLM-driven optimization through iterative prompting and in-context learning. LLMize formulates optimization as a black-box process in which candidate solutions are generated in natural language, evaluated by an external objective function, and refined over successive iterations using solution-score feedback. The framework supports multiple optimization strategies, including Optimization by Prompting (OPRO) and hybrid LLM-based methods inspired by evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. A key advantage of LLMize is the ability to inject constraints, rules, and domain knowledge directly through natural language descriptions, allowing practitioners to define complex optimization problems without requiring expertise in mathematical programming or metaheuristic design. LLMize is evaluated on convex optimization, linear programming, the Traveling Salesman Problem, neural network hyperparameter tuning, and nuclear fuel lattice optimization. Results show that while LLM-based optimization is not competitive with classical solvers for simple problems, it provides a practical and accessible approach for complex, domain-specific tasks where constraints and heuristics are difficult to formalize."}

However, at each hop, large language models (LLMs) retrieve subgraphs with numerous temporally similar and semantically complex relations, increasing the risk of suboptimal decisions and error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose the multi-hop reasoning enhanced (MRE) framework, which enhances both forward and backward reasoning to improve the identification of globally optimal reasoning trajectories. Specifically, MRE begins with prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating diverse reasoning trajectories for a given question. Valid reasoning trajectories are then selected for supervised fine-tuning, serving as a cold-start strategy. Finally, we introduce Tree-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO), a recursive, tree-structured learning-by-exploration approach. At each hop, exploration establishes strong causal dependencies on the previous hop, while evaluation is informed by multi-path exploration feedback from subsequent hops. Experimental results on two TKGQA benchmarks indicate that the proposed MRE-based model consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in handling complex multi-hop queries. Further analysis highlights improved interpretability and robustness to noisy temporal annotations."}

Our best instance outperforms Decision Trees, matches Support Vector Machine accuracy, and performs only slightly below Random Forests and GNNs trained on all features, all while remaining fully interpretable. Ablation studies show that our neuro-symbolic approach improves interpretability with comparable performance to pure statistical models. LearnAD demonstrates how symbolic learning can deepen our understanding of GNN behaviour in clinical neuroscience."}

The advantage of RMCTS over AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB is speed. In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.\n  The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in \"Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization\" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.\n  The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node. This is a disadvantage, but the speedup advantage is more significant, and in practice we find that RMCTS-trained networks match the quality of MCTS-UCB-trained networks in roughly one-third of the training time. We include timing and quality comparisons of RMCTS vs. MCTS-UCB for three games: Connect-4, Dots-and-Boxes, and Othello."}

Its simplicity and low memory cost make it a practical choice across data regression, tomographic reconstruction, and optimization. In contrast to many existing quantum linear solvers, our method does not rely on oracle access to query entries, relaxing a key practicality bottleneck. In particular, when the rank of the system of interest is sufficiently small and the rows of the matrix of interest admit an appropriate structure, we achieve circuit complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\log m\\right)$, where $m$ is the number of variables and $\\varepsilon$ is the target precision, without dependence on the sparsity $s$, and could possibly be without explicit dependence on condition number $κ$. This shows a significant improvement over previous quantum linear solvers where the dependence on $κ,s$ is at least linear. At the same time, when the rows have an arbitrary structure and have at most $s$ nonzero entries, we obtain the circuit depth $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\log s\\right)$ using extra $\\mathcal{O}(s)$ ancilla qubits, so the depth grows only logarithmically with sparsity $s$.

Focusing on quantum-specific effects absent from classical data-center evaluations, we analyze how optical-loss-induced Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation delays, coherence-limited entanglement retry windows, and contention from teleportation-based non-local gates shape end-to-end execution performance.

To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation.

While AI models have achieved notable success across various scientific domains, they typically remain domain-specific or lack the capability of simultaneously understanding and generating multimodal scientific data, particularly for high-dimensional data. Yet, many pressing global challenges and scientific problems are inherently cross-disciplinary and require coordinated progress across multiple fields. Here, we present FuXi-Uni, a native unified multimodal model for scientific understanding and high-fidelity generation across scientific domains within a single architecture. Specifically, FuXi-Uni aligns cross-disciplinary scientific tokens within natural language tokens and employs science decoder to reconstruct scientific tokens, thereby supporting both natural language conversation and scientific numerical prediction. Empirically, we validate FuXi-Uni in Earth science and Biomedicine. In Earth system modeling, the model supports global weather forecasting, tropical cyclone (TC) forecast editing, and spatial downscaling driven by only language instructions. FuXi-Uni generates 10-day global forecasts at 0.25° resolution that outperform the SOTA physical forecasting system. It shows superior performance for both TC track and intensity prediction relative to the SOTA physical model, and generates high-resolution regional weather fields that surpass standard interpolation baselines. Regarding biomedicine, FuXi-Uni outperforms leading multimodal large language models on multiple biomedical visual question answering benchmarks. By unifying heterogeneous scientific modalities within a native shared latent space while maintaining strong domain-specific performance, FuXi-Uni provides a step forward more general-purpose, multimodal scientific models."}

Here we introduce an ICO-based QEC protocol, providing the first application of indefinite causal order (ICO) to QEC. By coherently placing auxiliary controls and noisy evolution in an indefinite causal order, the resulting noncommutative interference enables an auxiliary system to herald and correct errors in real time, thereby circumventing the limitations of conventional QEC and restoring HL scaling. We rigorously establish the protocol for single- and multi-noise scenarios and demonstrate its performance in single-qubit, many-body, and continuous-variable platforms.

Conventional first-order stochastic methods (e.g., Adam) are plagued by slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and numerical instability, preventing NQS from reaching the high accuracy required for fundamental science. We address this fundamental optimization bottleneck by introducing the implicitly restarted Lanczos (IRL) method as the core engine for NQS training. Our key innovation is an inherently stable second-order optimization framework that recasts the ill-conditioned parameter update problem into a small, well-posed Hermitian eigenvalue problem. By solving this problem efficiently and robustly with IRL, our approach automatically determines the optimal descent direction and step size, circumventing the need for demanding hyperparameter tuning and eliminating the numerical instabilities common in standard iterative solvers. We demonstrate that IRL enables shallow NQS architectures (with orders of magnitude fewer parameters) to consistently achieve extreme precision (1e-12 kcal/mol) in just 3 to 5 optimization steps. For the F2 molecule, this translates to an approximate 17,900-fold speed-up in total runtime compared to Adam. This work establishes IRL as a superior, robust, and efficient second-order optimization strategy for variational quantum models, paving the way for the practical, high-fidelity application of neural networks in quantum physics and chemistry."}

Existing methods either suffer from unstable training due to directly maximizing value objectives, or face computational issues due to relying on crude Gaussian likelihood approximation, which requires a large amount of sufficiently small denoising steps. In this work, we propose DIPOLE (Dichotomous diffusion Policy improvement), a novel RL algorithm designed for stable and controllable diffusion policy optimization. We begin by revisiting the KL-regularized objective in RL, which offers a desirable weighted regression objective for diffusion policy extraction, but often struggles to balance greediness and stability. We then formulate a greedified policy regularization scheme, which naturally enables decomposing the optimal policy into a pair of stably learned dichotomous policies: one aims at reward maximization, and the other focuses on reward minimization. Under such a design, optimized actions can be generated by linearly combining the scores of dichotomous policies during inference, thereby enabling flexible control over the level of greediness.Evaluations in offline and offline-to-online RL settings on ExORL and OGBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also use DIPOLE to train a large vision-language-action (VLA) model for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) and evaluate it on the large-scale real-world AD benchmark NAVSIM, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications."}

To address this, we propose a three-step pipeline named AAAI (Association Identification, Automated Detection, and Adaptive Inference). Experiments on three representative SLMs reveal that: (1) factual hallucinations are positively correlated with misclassifications; (2) encoder-based verifiers effectively detect factual hallucinations; and (3) incorporating feedback on factual errors enables SLMs' adaptive inference that enhances classification performance.

Across these problems, our method inherently satisfies all constraints by construction, converges faster, and achieves higher Approximation Ratios than penalty-based QAOA, while requiring roughly half as many gates. By embedding constraint-aware operators into an adaptive variational framework, our approach establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient pathway for solving practical constrained optimization problems on near-term quantum devices."}

We study a generative modeling approach for producing new realizations from a limited set of available runs by transferring structure learned across an ensemble. Using monthly near-surface temperature time series from ten independent reanalysis realizations (ERA5), we find that a vanilla conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) trained jointly across realizations yields a fragmented latent space that fails to generalize to unseen ensemble members. To address this, we introduce a latent-constrained CVAE (LC-CVAE) that enforces cross-realization homogeneity of latent embeddings at a small set of shared geographic 'anchor' locations. We then use multi-output Gaussian process regression in the latent space to predict latent coordinates at unsampled locations in a new realization, followed by decoding to generate full time series fields. Experiments and ablations demonstrate (i) instability when training on a single realization, (ii) diminishing returns after incorporating roughly five realizations, and (iii) a trade-off between spatial coverage and reconstruction quality that is closely linked to the average neighbor distance in latent space."}

Using a rigorous synthetic benchmark, we demonstrate that unstructured text embeddings capture critical confounding information that is absent from structured tabular data.

However, despite its power, the standard attention mechanism is plagued by well-documented issues: representational collapse and attention sink. Although prior work has proposed approaches for these issues, they are often studied in isolation, obscuring their deeper connection. In this paper, we present a unified perspective, arguing that both can be traced to a common root -- improper attention allocation. We identify two failure modes: 1) Attention Overload, where tokens receive comparable high weights, blurring semantic features that lead to representational collapse; 2) Attention Underload, where no token is semantically relevant, yet attention is still forced to distribute, resulting in spurious focus such as attention sink. Building on this insight, we introduce Lazy Attention, a novel mechanism designed for a more focused attention distribution. To mitigate overload, it employs positional discrimination across both heads and dimensions to sharpen token distinctions. To counteract underload, it incorporates Elastic-Softmax, a modified normalization function that relaxes the standard softmax constraint to suppress attention on irrelevant tokens. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu corpus, evaluated across nine diverse benchmarks, demonstrate that Lazy Attention successfully mitigates attention sink and achieves competitive performance compared to both standard attention and modern architectures, while reaching up to 59.58% attention sparsity."}

We propose a Bayesian, cost-aware multi-LLM orchestration framework that treats LLMs as approximate likelihood models rather than classifiers. For each candidate state, we elicit likelihoods via contrastive prompting, aggregate across diverse models with robust statistics, and update beliefs with Bayes rule under explicit priors as new evidence arrives.

To address these challenges, we propose MODE, a unified framework that integrates Low-Rank Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) with an Enhanced Mamba architecture. As illustrated in our framework, the input sequence is first transformed by a Linear Tokenization Layer and then processed through multiple Mamba Encoder blocks, each equipped with an Enhanced Mamba Layer that employs Causal Convolution, SiLU activation, and a Low-Rank Neural ODE enhancement to efficiently capture temporal dynamics. This low-rank formulation reduces computational overhead while maintaining expressive power. Furthermore, a segmented selective scanning mechanism, inspired by pseudo-ODE dynamics, adaptively focuses on salient subsequences to improve scalability and long-range sequence modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODE surpasses existing baselines in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, our contributions include: (1) a unified and efficient architecture for long-term time series modeling, (2) integration of Mamba's selective scanning with low-rank Neural ODEs for enhanced temporal representation, and (3) substantial improvements in efficiency and scalability enabled by low-rank approximation and dynamic selective scanning."}

We benchmark tuned classical baselines, geometry-aware symmetric positive definite (SPD) descriptors with Stein divergence, and quantum kernel models designed for low-dimensional tabular data. In the muscle-weight setting, quantum kernel ridge regression using four interpretable inputs (blood C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, and condition) attains a test root mean squared error of 4.41 mg and coefficient of determination of 0.605, improving over a matched ridge baseline on the same feature set (4.70 mg and 0.553). Geometry-informed Stein-divergence prototype distances yield a smaller but consistent gain in the biomarker-only setting (4.55 mg versus 4.79 mg). Screening-style evaluation, obtained by thresholding the continuous outcome at 0.8 times the training Sham mean, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of up to 0.90 for detecting low muscle weight.

The second stage, context navigation, guides the reasoning process within that representation to make decisions. We validate this framework through a focal replication of a sequential purchasing game with quality signaling (Kremer and Debo, 2016), extending to a crowdfunding game with costly signaling (Cason et al., 2025) and a demand-estimation task (Gui and Toubia, 2025) to test generalizability across decision environments. Across four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-4.0-Sonnet-Thinking, DeepSeek-R1), we find that complex decision-making environments require both stages to achieve behavioral alignment with human benchmarks, whereas the simpler demand-estimation task requires only context formation.

Applying rules to such inputs demands both interpretive flexibility and formal guarantees. Large language models (LLMs) provide flexibility but cannot ensure consistent rule application; symbolic systems provide guarantees but require structured input. This paper presents an integration pattern that combines these strengths: LLMs serve as ontology population engines, translating unstructured text into ABox assertions according to expert-authored TBox specifications, while SWRL-based reasoners apply rules with deterministic guarantees. The framework decomposes reasoning into entity identification, assertion extraction, and symbolic verification, with task definitions grounded in OWL 2 ontologies. Experiments across three domains (legal hearsay determination, scientific method-task application, clinical trial eligibility) and eleven language models validate the approach. Structured decomposition achieves statistically significant improvements over few-shot prompting in aggregate, with gains observed across all three domains. An ablation study confirms that symbolic verification provides substantial benefit beyond structured prompting alone. The populated ABox integrates with standard semantic web tooling for inspection and querying, positioning the framework for richer inference patterns that simpler formalisms cannot express."}

Moreover, we show that the HHG spectral features encode information about the quantum nature of the driving field, revealing the presence of its squeezed field fluctuations. By analyzing the HHG spectral intensity dependence as a function of the driver's ellipticity and squeezing orientation, we identify a means to probe the driving field's quantum properties that intrinsically lie in the high-photon number regime."}

While conditional computation enables substantial gains in computational efficiency, it remains unclear whether the interaction between sparse routing and temperature-based sampling compromises output stability relative to dense architectures. This work investigates whether conditional computation in MoE models amplifies decoding-induced randomness, leading to reduced reliability as temperature increases. We evaluate three representative models: OLMoE-7B (sparse base), Mixtral-8x7B (sparse instruction-tuned), and Qwen2.5-3B (dense instruction-tuned) on deterministic arithmetic reasoning tasks with objectively verifiable answers. Experiments span four decoding configurations, ranging from greedy decoding to T=1.0. Our evaluation encompasses accuracy, format compliance, output consistency across repeated generations, and confidence metrics, totaling 9,360 model generations. Results demonstrate that the sparse instruction-tuned model exhibits stability comparable to the dense instruction-tuned model across all decoding temperatures, while the sparse base model shows systematic degradation as temperature increases. These findings indicate that instruction tuning, rather than architectural sparsity, is the primary determinant of robustness to decoding randomness on deterministic tasks. We discuss the implications of these results for deploying sparse language models in reliability-critical applications, highlighting scenarios in which sparse architectures can be safely adopted without sacrificing output stability."}

This, together with the unprecedented longevity of trapped ions, opens an avenue for the exploration of phenomena that take place on long timescales, e.g., slow and collective relaxation in frustrated and kinetically constrained systems. Our platform makes use of the strong dipolar interactions among electronic Rydberg states and planar confinement provided by a Penning trap. We investigate how the strong electric and magnetic fields that form this trap affect the properties of the Rydberg states and show that spin-spin interaction strengths on the order of MHz are achievable under experimentally realistic conditions.

Our method systematically suppresses spurious features using feature masking, sensitivity-aware regularization, and adversarial augmentation in a closed-loop refinement pipeline. This approach does not require additional datasets or model architectures and integrates seamlessly into standard adversarial training.

Our simulator, which we call SarSim0 (SARIMA Simulator for Zero-Shot Forecasting), is based off of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model as its core data source. Due to instability in the autoregressive component, naive SARIMA simulation often leads to unusable paths. Instead, we follow a three-step procedure: (1) we sample well-behaved trajectories from its characteristic polynomial stability region; (2) we introduce a superposition scheme that combines multiple paths into rich multi-seasonality traces; and (3) we add rate-based heavy-tailed noise models to capture burstiness and intermittency alongside seasonalities and trends. SarSim0 is orders of magnitude faster than kernel-based generators, and it enables training on circa 1B unique purely simulated series, generated on the fly; after which well-established neural network backbones exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing strong statistical forecasters and recent foundation baselines, while operating under strict zero-shot protocol.

Direct prediction yields mean relative errors of 0.765 to 1.262 across models, while solver-assisted computation achieves 0.225 to 0.301, representing error reductions of 67.9% to 81.8%.

Its structure highlights the omnipresent significance of one-body $N$-representability: (i) the domain is exactly determined by the $N$-representability conditions; (ii) at its boundary, the gradient of the functional diverges repulsively, thereby generalizing the recently discovered Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) force; and (iii) an explicit expression for this boundary force follows directly from geometric arguments.

This is critical for assessing the service life of civil infrastructure subjected to aggressive environments. The adopted methodology relies on several simple and complex standalone machine learning (ML) algorithms, with the primary objective of establishing confidence in the unbiased prediction of the underlying hidden correlations. The simple algorithms include linear regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). The complex algorithms entail support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and two families of artificial neural networks, including a feedforward network (multilayer perceptron, MLP) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The MLP architecture cannot explicitly handle sequential data, a limitation addressed by the GRU. A comprehensive dataset is considered. The performance of ML algorithms is evaluated, with KRR, GPR, and MLP exhibiting high accuracy. Given the diversity of the adopted concrete mixture proportions, the GRU was unable to accurately reproduce the response in the test set. Further analyses elucidate the contributions of mixture compositions to the temporal evolution of chloride. The results obtained from the GPR model unravel latent correlations through clear and explainable trends. The MLP, SVR, and KRR also provide acceptable estimates of the overall trends. The majority of mixture components exhibit an inverse relation with chloride content, while a few components demonstrate a direct correlation. These findings highlight the potential of surrogate approaches for describing the physical processes involved in chloride ingress and the associated correlations, toward the ultimate goal of enhancing the service life of civil infrastructure."}

The framework evaluates decision policies across ensembles of plausible futures, explicitly modeling uncertainty, intervention effects, value ambiguity, and governance constraints. Alignment is assessed through distributional properties including expected utility, variance, tail risk, and probability of misalignment rather than accuracy or ranking performance. This approach distinguishes probabilistic prediction from decision reasoning under uncertainty and provides an executable methodology for evaluating trust and alignment in enterprise and institutional AI systems. The result is a practical foundation for governing AI systems whose impact is determined not by individual forecasts, but by policy behavior across distributions and tail events.

Existing explanations largely attribute this phenomenon to optimization instability or vanishing gradients, yet such accounts fail to explain why collapse persists even under modern normalization and initialization schemes. In this paper, we argue that the collapse of deep Transformers is fundamentally a geometric problem. Standard residual updates implicitly assume that feature accumulation is always beneficial, but offer no mechanism to constrain update directions or to erase outdated information. As depth increases, this leads to systematic drift off the semantic manifold and monotonic feature accumulation, causing representational degeneracy. We propose a unified geometric framework that addresses these failures through two orthogonal principles. First, manifold-constrained hyper-connections restrict residual updates to valid local tangent directions, preventing uncontrolled manifold drift. Second, deep delta learning introduces data-dependent, non-monotonic updates that enable reflection and erasure of redundant features rather than their unconditional accumulation. Together, these mechanisms decouple the direction and sign of feature updates, yielding a stable geometric evolution across depth.

We apply COMPASS to eight diverse industry scenarios, generating and validating 5,920 queries that test both routine compliance and adversarial robustness through strategically designed edge cases.

Motivated by this question, we study the learnability and cryptographic applications of random open-system dynamics generated by Lindblad-Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan (GKSL) master equations. Working in the affine hull of the GKSL cone, we introduce physically motivated ensembles of random local Lindbladians via a linear parametrisation around a reference generator. On top of this geometric structure, we extend statistical query (SQ) and quantum-process statistical query (QPStat) frameworks to the open-system setting and prove exponential (in the parameter dimension $M$) lower bounds on the number of queries required to learn random Lindbladian dynamics. In particular, we establish average-case SQ-hardness for learning output distributions in total variation distance and average-case QPStat-hardness for learning Lindbladian channels in diamond norm. To support these results physically, we derive a linear-response expression for the ensemble-averaged total variation distance and verify the required nonvanishing scaling in a random local amplitude-damping chain. Finally, we design two Lindbladian physically unclonable function (Lindbladian-PUF) protocols based on random Lindbladian ensembles with distribution-level and tomography-based verification, thereby providing open-system examples where learning hardness can be translated into cryptographic security guarantees."}

The dynamics are governed by a master equation derived from an effective Hamiltonian that includes cavity decay.To obtain analytical solutions, the system's quantum state is expanded in the Fock basis up to the two-photon level. Solving the steady-state Schrodinger equation yields probability amplitudes and the analytical conditions for optimal photon blockade. Results confirm that photon blockade is achievable with suitable parameters. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical solutions and numerical simulations for the steady-state, equal-time second-order correlation function, validating both the analytical method and the blockade effect.Numerically, the average intracavity photon number increases significantly under resonance, providing a theoretical pathway for enhancing single-photon source brightness. Furthermore, the driving phase is shown to regulate the optimal blockade region: it shifts the parabolic region within the two-dimensional parameter space of driving strength and OPA nonlinearity and can even reverse its opening direction.The influence of Kerr nonlinearity is also examined. Photon blockade remains robust across a wide range of Kerr strengths. Physical analysis attributes the effect to destructive quantum interference between two distinct excitation pathways that suppress two-photon states. While Kerr nonlinearity shifts the system's energy levels, it does not disrupt this interference mechanism, explaining the effect's stability over a broad parameter range."}

In this work, we build on classical Wiener chaos expansions (WCE) to design neural operator (NO) architectures for SPDEs and SDEs: we project the driving noise paths onto orthonormal Wick Hermite features and parameterize the resulting deterministic chaos coefficients with neural operators, so that full solution trajectories can be reconstructed from noise in a single forward pass. On the theoretical side, we investigate the classical WCE results for the class of multi-dimensional SDEs and semilinear SPDEs considered here by explicitly writing down the associated coupled ODE/PDE systems for their chaos coefficients, which makes the separation between stochastic forcing and deterministic dynamics fully explicit and directly motivates our model designs. On the empirical side, we validate our models on a diverse suite of problems: classical SPDE benchmarks, diffusion one-step sampling on images, topological interpolation on graphs, financial extrapolation, parameter estimation, and manifold SDEs for flood prediction, demonstrating competitive accuracy and broad applicability. Overall, our results indicate that WCE-based neural operators provide a practical and scalable way to learn SDE/SPDE solution operators across diverse domains."}

This paper introduces an agent framework grounded in real-world practical experience, with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive prompt generation strategy that aligns with the agent's state and task goals to improve reliability and robustness; (2) a context-aware tool orchestration module that performs tool categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation based on user intent and context; and (3) a layered memory mechanism that integrates session memory, task history, and external summaries to improve relevance and efficiency through dynamic summarization and compression.

Here, we carry out an in-depth quantum information investigation, deploying two distinct models: The first, semiclassical model can violate the quantum Cramer-Rao bound by several orders of magnitude for weak dissipation and large atom numbers, invalidating the semiclassical approach in this parameter regime. The second model, describing the atoms as a collective spin, respects the Cramer-Rao bound for all parameters. Interestingly, the collective model also predicts Heisenberg scaling for the quantum Fisher information. The comparison of both models shows that Heisenberg scaling is a result of measurement-induced quantum correlation in an otherwise non-interacting quantum system. As the Heisenberg scaling appears in a stationary state of a macroscopic quantum system, it can be thus viewed as a new paradigm in quantum sensing. Intriguingly, the comparison of both models with experimental data can constitute a test for the foundations of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic ensemble of atoms."}

We apply the framework on an unsupervised task, channel state information (CSI) compression, using autoencoders. Using metrics based on UMAP embeddings, combined with Wasserstein and Euclidean distances, we achieve Pearson correlations exceeding 0.85 between dataset distances and train-on-one/test-on-another task performance. We also apply the framework to a supervised beam prediction in the downlink using convolutional neural networks.

However, there is still no satisfactory theory that describes how coarse-grained quantities, such as blockwise intensity or class proportions after partitioning an image into spatial blocks, are preserved and evolve along the reverse diffusion dynamics. In previous work, the author introduced an information-theoretic Lyapunov function V for non-ergodic Markov processes on a state space partitioned into blocks, defined as the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence to the set of stationary distributions reachable from a given initial condition, and showed that a leak-tolerant potential V-delta with a prescribed tolerance for block masses admits a closed-form expression as a scaling-and-clipping operation on block masses.\n  In this paper, I transplant this framework to the reverse diffusion process in generative models and propose a reverse diffusion scheme that is projected by the potential V-delta (referred to as the V-delta projected reverse diffusion). I extend the monotonicity of V to time-inhomogeneous block-preserving Markov kernels and show that, under small leakage and the V-delta projection, V-delta acts as an approximate Lyapunov function. Furthermore, using a toy model consisting of block-constant images and a simplified reverse kernel, I numerically demonstrate that the proposed method keeps the block-mass error and the leak-tolerant potential within the prescribed tolerance, while achieving pixel-wise accuracy and visual quality comparable to the non-projected dynamics. This study reinterprets generative sampling as a decrease of an information potential from noise to data, and provides a design principle for reverse diffusion processes with explicit control of coarse-grained quantities."}

Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations. We argue that TTCs enhance the interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain, which links theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without modifying benchmarks or requiring agreement on a single theory."}

Moreover, the relationship between PINEM and Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect and nonlinear Compton scattering is still unclear. Here we develop the full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction considering the two-photon process. It is revealed that the emission/absorption of two photons by electrons can be greatly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of optical near field, and the quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes can occur in some circumstances, which affects the photon number state, electron energy states and electron-photon entanglement. Meanwhile, it is found that the KD effect (elastic electron-photon scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic electron-photon scattering) are also a kind of two-photon process and the distribution of electrons can be deduced analytically based on the full quantum theory.

As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency.\n  We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners. The adaptive decay mechanism dynamically regulates the influence of uncertain waypoints within the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while substantially reducing memory overhead.

In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms."}

This paper proposes the integration of low-power edge devices using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) into aquaculture systems to enable real-time automated monitoring and control, such as collecting data and triggering alarms, and reducing labor requirements. The system provides real-time data on the required parameters such as pH levels, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia levels to control water quality, nutrient levels, and environmental conditions enabling better maintenance, efficient resource utilization, and optimal management of the enclosed aquaculture space. The system enables alerts in case of anomaly detection. The data collected by the sensors over time can serve for important decision-making regarding optimizing water treatment processes, feed distribution, feed pattern analysis and improve feed efficiency, reducing operational costs. This research explores the feasibility of developing TinyML-based solutions for aquaculture monitoring, considering factors such as sensor selection, algorithm design, hardware constraints, and ethical considerations. By demonstrating the potential benefits of TinyML in aquaculture, our aim is to contribute to the development of more sustainable and efficient farming practices."}

Its objective is to extract hidden and meaningful knowledge from datasets through a structured process comprising several key steps: data selection, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, and visualization. Among the core data mining techniques are classification and clustering. Classification involves predicting the class of new instances using a classifier trained on labeled data. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, including Decision Tree Induction, Bayesian classifiers, Nearest Neighbor search, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The last one is recognized as an effective approach for interpretable and explainable learning. It is grounded in the mathematical structure of the concept lattice, which enables the generation of formal concepts and the discovery of hidden relationships among them. In this paper, we present a state-of-theart review of FCA-based classifiers. We explore various methods for computing closure operators from nominal data and introduce a novel approach for constructing a partial concept lattice that focuses on the most relevant concepts. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method."}

This study focuses on hidden information extraction under undetermined signal bits, revealing that most such QPQ protocols face severe security threats even without complex quantum resources. Specifically, direct observation attack causes incremental information leakage, while the minimum error discrimination attack efficiently steals additional database inforamtion. To address these critical flaws, the proposed multi-encryption defense scheme is compatible with existing QPQ protocols.

There are three principled ways to deal with non-stationarity, including sliding-window, weighted, and restart strategies. As many non-stationary environments exhibit gradual drifting patterns, the weighted strategy is commonly adopted in real-world applications. However, previous theoretical studies show that its analysis is more involved and the algorithms are either computationally less efficient or statistically suboptimal. This paper revisits the weighted strategy for non-stationary parametric bandits. In linear bandits (LB), we discover that this undesirable feature is due to an inadequate regret analysis, which results in an overly complex algorithm design. We propose a \\emph{refined analysis framework}, which simplifies the derivation and, importantly, produces a simpler weight-based algorithm that is as efficient as window/restart-based algorithms while retaining the same regret as previous studies. Furthermore, our new framework can be used to improve regret bounds of other parametric bandits, including Generalized Linear Bandits (GLB) and Self-Concordant Bandits (SCB). For example, we develop a simple weighted GLB algorithm with an $\\tilde{O}(k_μ^{5/4} c_μ^{-3/4} d^{3/4} P_T^{1/4}T^{3/4})$ regret, improving the $\\tilde{O}(k_μ^{2} c_μ^{-1}d^{9/10} P_T^{1/5}T^{4/5})$ bound in prior work, where $k_μ$ and $c_μ$ characterize the reward model's nonlinearity, $P_T$ measures the non-stationarity, $d$ and $T$ denote the dimension and time horizon. Moreover, we extend our framework to non-stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with function approximation, focusing on Linear Mixture MDP and Multinomial Logit (MNL) Mixture MDP. For both classes, we propose algorithms based on the weighted strategy and establish dynamic regret guarantees using our analysis framework."}

Despite extensive empirical observations, it remains unclear which features of degenerate ground states are preferentially sampled and why by QA. Here we analyze the final states using degenerate perturbation theory to characterize the preference among them. In this analysis, the adjacency matrix of the graph composed by the ground states naturally emerges, and we can predict the eigenvector centralities (one of the node centralities) are related to the probabilities of these states. We verify this prediction on toy models where degeneracy is lifted at first and second order, and we show that second-order weights encode local barrier information, relating sampling fairness to the flatness of the local energy landscape. Finally, this perspective suggests two practical routes toward fair sampling -- promoting connectivity of the graph and reducing heterogeneity of centralities -- and we illustrate consistency with higher-order drivers and minor-embedding transformations."}

These streams obey smooth, time-parameterized symmetries, which combine through a precisely structured algebra; yet most neural network world models ignore this structure and instead repeatedly re-learn the same transformations from data. In this work, we introduce 'Flow Equivariant World Models', a framework in which both self-motion and external object motion are unified as one-parameter Lie group 'flows'. We leverage this unification to implement group equivariance with respect to these transformations, thereby providing a stable latent world representation over hundreds of timesteps. On both 2D and 3D partially observed video world modeling benchmarks, we demonstrate that Flow Equivariant World Models significantly outperform comparable state-of-the-art diffusion-based and memory-augmented world modeling architectures -- particularly when there are predictable world dynamics outside the agent's current field of view. We show that flow equivariance is particularly beneficial for long rollouts, generalizing far beyond the training horizon. By structuring world model representations with respect to internal and external motion, flow equivariance charts a scalable route to data efficient, symmetry-guided, embodied intelligence.

In this article, we present MindChat, a privacy-preserving LLM for mental health support, together with MindCorpus, a synthetic multi-turn counseling dataset constructed via a multi-agent role-playing framework. To synthesize high-quality counseling data, the developed dialogue-construction framework employs a dual closed-loop feedback design to integrate psychological expertise and counseling techniques through role-playing: (i) turn-level critique-and-revision to improve coherence and counseling appropriateness within a session, and (ii) session-level strategy refinement to progressively enrich counselor behaviors across sessions. To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks. Experiments on synthetic-data quality assessment and counseling capability evaluation show that MindCorpus improves training effectiveness and that MindChat is competitive with existing general and counseling-oriented LLM baselines under both automatic LLM-judge and human evaluation protocols, while exhibiting reduced privacy leakage under membership inference attacks."}

Contemporary QD algorithms focus on low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and thus receive identical discount values. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new QD applications by introducing two domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other black-box QD algorithms."}

Here we reveal the physical meaning of these mathematical achievements for the quantum mechanical transition probability. We show that this transition probability features a maximum degree of homogeneity in all simple Euclidean Jordan algebras, which includes common finite-dimensional Hilbert space quantum theory. The atomic parts of these algebras or, equivalently, the extreme boundaries of their state spaces can be characterized by purely topological means. This is an important difference to many other recent approaches that aim to distinguish the entire state spaces among the convex compact sets. An interesting case with non-homogeneous transition probability arises, when the $E_6$-symmetric bioctonionic projective plane is used as quantum logic."}

Here we present the Central Dogma Transformer (CDT), an architecture that integrates pre-trained language models for DNA, RNA, and protein following the directional logic of the Central Dogma. CDT employs directional cross-attention mechanisms - DNA-to-RNA attention models transcriptional regulation, while RNA-to-Protein attention models translational relationships - producing a unified Virtual Cell Embedding that integrates all three modalities. We validate CDT v1 - a proof-of-concept implementation using fixed (non-cell-specific) RNA and protein embeddings - on CRISPRi enhancer perturbation data from K562 cells, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.503, representing 63% of the theoretical ceiling set by cross-experiment variability (r = 0.797).

Proper reasoning leads to understanding of a given subject. This reasoning was conceptualized as a process of understanding in a particular way, i.e., \"symbolic reasoning\". Foundational Models (FM) demonstrate that this is not a necessary condition for many reasoning tasks: they can \"reason\" by way of imitating the process of \"thinking out loud\", testing the produced pathways, and iterating on these pathways on their own. This leads to some form of reasoning that can solve problems on its own or with few-shot learning, but appears fundamentally different from human reasoning due to its lack of grounding and common sense, leading to brittleness of the reasoning process. These insights promise to substantially alter our assessment of reasoning and its necessary conditions, but also inform the approaches to safety and robust defences against this brittleness of FMs. This paper offers and discusses several philosophical interpretations of this phenomenon, argues that the previously apt metaphor of the \"stochastic parrot\" has lost its relevance and thus should be abandoned, and reflects on different normative elements in the safety- and appropriateness-considerations emerging from these reasoning models and their growing capacity."}

Consequently, they fail to capture complex interactions among risk factors and are limited in predicting early-stage CKD. Our objective was to develop and evaluate an explainable machine learning (ML) framework for community-based early-stage CKD screening for low-resource settings, tailored to the Bangladeshi and South Asian population context. We used a community-based dataset from Bangladesh, the first such CKD dataset in South and South Asia, and evaluated twelve ML classifiers across multiple feature domains. Ten complementary feature selection techniques were applied to identify robust, generalizable predictors. The final models were assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. External validation was conducted on three independent datasets from India, the UAE, and Bangladesh. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to provide model explainability. An ML model trained on an RFECV-selected feature subset achieved a balanced accuracy of 90.40%, whereas minimal non-pathology-test features demonstrated excellent predictive capability with a balanced accuracy of 89.23%, often outperforming larger or full feature sets. Compared with existing screening tools, the proposed models achieved substantially higher accuracy and sensitivity while requiring fewer and more accessible inputs.

A crucial component of GNNs is the pooling procedure, in which the node features calculated by the model are combined to form an informative final descriptor to be used for the downstream task. However, previous graph pooling schemes rely on the last GNN layer features as an input to the pooling or classifier layers, potentially under-utilizing important activations of previous layers produced during the forward pass of the model, which we regard as historical graph activations. This gap is particularly pronounced in cases where a node's representation can shift significantly over the course of many graph neural layers, and worsened by graph-specific challenges such as over-smoothing in deep architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce HISTOGRAPH, a novel two-stage attention-based final aggregation layer that first applies a unified layer-wise attention over intermediate activations, followed by node-wise attention. By modeling the evolution of node representations across layers, our HISTOGRAPH leverages both the activation history of nodes and the graph structure to refine features used for final prediction.

Recent studies have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate formulation and process development, drastically transforming current approaches to pharmaceutical 3D printing. To date, most AI-driven efforts remain narrowly focused, while failing to account for the broader formulation challenges inherent to the technology. Recent advances in AI have introduced artificial general intelligence concepts, wherein systems extend beyond conventional predictive modelling toward more generalised, human-like reasoning. In this work, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) dataset comprising over 1400 formulations, to recommend suitable excipients based on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dose, and predict filament mechanical properties. Four LLM architectures were fine-tuned, with systematic evaluation of both fine-tuning and generative parameter configurations. Our results demonstrate that Llama2 was best suited for recommending excipients for FDM formulations. Additionally, model selection and parameterisation significantly influence performance, with smaller LLMs exhibiting instances of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate: (i) even with relatively small dataset of over 1400 formulations, it can lead to model catastrophic forgetting; (ii) standard LLM metrics only evaluate linguistic performance but not formulation processability; and (iii) LLMs trained on biomedically-related data do not always produce the best results. Addressing these challenges is essential to advancing LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency and toward reliable systems for pharmaceutical formulation development."}

For single-qubit system, we construct explicit unitary 1-design paths from spherical 2-design curves and Hopf fibration theory. For arbitrary dimensions, we develop two systematic construction frameworks, one based on topological bundle theory of the unitary group and the other based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group. On the practical front, our unitary design paths provide analytical solutions to universally robust quantum control. Simulations show they outperform conventional pulse techniques in mitigating arbitrary unknown static noises, demonstrating immediate utility for quantum engineering. Extending unitary designs to the continuous domain not only introduces powerful geometric and topological tools that complement conventional combinatorial and group-theoretic methods, but also enhances experimental feasibility over discrete counterparts which usually involve instantaneous pulses. As an outlook, we anticipate that this work will pave the way for using continuous unitary designs to explore complex quantum dynamics and devise quantum information protocols."}

According to Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations (1953), family resemblance holds that members of a concept or category are connected by overlapping similarities rather than a single defining property. Consequently, a family of entities forms a chain of items sharing overlapping traits. This philosophical idea naturally lends itself to a graph-based approach in machine learning. Accordingly, we propose the Wittgenstein's Family Resemblance (WFR) clustering algorithm and its kernel variant, kernel WFR. This algorithm computes resemblance scores between neighboring data instances, and after thresholding these scores, a resemblance graph is constructed. The connected components of this graph define the resulting clusters. Simulations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WFR is an effective nonlinear clustering algorithm that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters or assumptions about their shapes."}

However, the unavoidable crosstalk between qubits in current noisy processors impedes the achievement of high gate fidelities and renders full Hilbert-space control optimization prohibitively difficult. Here, we overcome this challenge by reducing the full-system optimization to crosstalk-robust control over constant-sized subsystems, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. Our method effectively eliminates the leading-order gate operation deviations induced by crosstalk, thereby suppressing error rates. Within this framework, we construct analytical pulse solutions for parallel single-qubit gates and numerical pulses for parallel multi-qubit operations. We validate the proposed approach numerically across multiple platforms, including coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers, a nuclear-spin processor, and superconducting-qubit arrays with up to 200 qubits. As a result, the noise scaling is reduced from exponential to linear for parallel single-qubit gates, and an order-of-magnitude reduction is achieved for parallel multi-qubit gates. Moreover, our method does not require precise knowledge of crosstalk strengths and makes no assumption about the underlying qubit connectivity or lattice geometry, thereby establishing a scalable framework for parallel quantum control in large-scale quantum architectures."}

The NL architecture converts input characteristics into chaos-based ring-rate representations that encapsulate nonlinear relationships within the data, whereas ST progressively enlarges the labelled set utilising high-confidence pseudo-labelled samples. The model's performance is assessed using ten benchmark datasets and five machine learning classifiers, with 85% of the training data considered unlabelled and just 15% utilised as labelled data. The proposed Self-Training Neurochaos Learning (NL+ST) architecture consistently attains superior performance gain relative to standalone ST models, especially on limited, nonlinear and imbalanced datasets like Iris (188.66%), Wine (158.58%) and Glass Identification (110.48%).

We investigate the question of maximal correlations analogous to the maximally entangled states defined in the entanglement theory of multipartite systems. To formalize this, we employ the sheaf-theoretic framework for contextuality, which generalizes non-locality. This provides a new metric for correlations called contextual fraction (CF), which ranges from 0 (non-contextual) to 1 (maximally contextual). Using this, we have defined the absolutely maximal contextual correlations (AMCC), which are maximally contextual and have maximal marginals, which captures the notion of absolutely maximal entangled (AME) states. The Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box serves as the bipartite example, and we construct various extensions of such correlations in the tripartite case. An infinite family of various forms of AMCC is constructed using the parity check method and the constraint satisfiability problem (CSP) scheme. We also demonstrate the existence of maximally contextual correlations, which do not exhibit maximal marginals, and refer to them as non-AMCC. The results are further applied to secret sharing and randomness extraction using AMCC correlations."}

Although many deep learning methods have proven effective in learning time-series data for classification, they were originally developed under the assumption of balanced data distributions. Once data distribution is uneven, these methods tend to ignore the minority class that is typically of higher practical significance. Oversampling methods have been designed to address this by generating minority-class samples, but their reliance on linear interpolation often hampers the preservation of temporal dynamics and the generation of diverse samples. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Evo-TFS, a novel evolutionary oversampling method that integrates both time- and frequency-domain characteristics. In Evo-TFS, strongly typed genetic programming is employed to evolve diverse, high-quality time series, guided by a fitness function that incorporates both time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics. Experiments conducted on imbalanced time series datasets demonstrate that Evo-TFS outperforms existing oversampling methods, significantly enhancing the performance of time-domain and frequency-domain classifiers."}

The resulting lack of interoperability leads to significant missed potential, as quantum software tools remain isolated and cannot be seamlessly integrated into cohesive toolchains.\n  The Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) has addressed analogous challenges in the classical domain. It was developed within the LLVM project, which has long powered robust software stacks and enabled compilation across diverse software and hardware components, with particular importance in high-performance computing environments. However, MLIR's steep learning curve poses a significant barrier to entry, particularly in quantum computing, where much of the software stack is still predominantly built by experimentalists out of necessity rather than by experienced software engineers.\n  This paper provides a practical and hands-on guide for quantum software engineers to overcome this steep learning curve. Through a concrete case study linking Xanadu's PennyLane framework with the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), we outline actionable integration steps, highlight best practices, and share hard-earned insights from real-world development. This work aims to support quantum tool developers in navigating MLIR's complexities and to foster its adoption as a unifying bridge across a rapidly growing ecosystem of quantum software tools, ultimately guiding the development of more modular, interoperable, and integrated quantum software stacks."}

A core challenge in categorical data clustering lies in measuring similarity among attribute values that lack inherent ordering or distance. Without appropriate similarity measures, values are often treated as equidistant, creating a semantic gap that obscures latent structures and degrades clustering quality. Although existing methods infer value relationships from within-dataset co-occurrence patterns, such inference becomes unreliable when samples are limited, leaving the semantic context of the data underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present ARISE (Attention-weighted Representation with Integrated Semantic Embeddings), which draws on external semantic knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic-aware representations that complement the metric space of categorical data for accurate clustering. That is, LLM is adopted to describe attribute values for representation enhancement, and the LLM-enhanced embeddings are combined with the original data to explore semantically prominent clusters.

Developer-relevant personality and behavioral traits were identified through a systematic literature review and an empirical study of professional software engineers. A custom mobile game was designed to elicit behaviors related to problem solving, planning, adaptability, persistence, time management, and information seeking. Fine-grained gameplay event data were collected and analyzed using a two-phase modeling strategy where suitability was predicted exclusively from gameplay-derived behavioral features. Results show that our model achieved up to 97% precision and 94% accuracy. Behavioral analysis revealed that proper candidates exhibited distinct gameplay patterns, such as more wins in puzzle-based games, more side challenges, navigating menus more frequently, and exhibiting fewer pauses, retries, and surrender actions. These findings demonstrate that implicit behavioral traces captured during gameplay is promising in predicting software-development suitability without explicit personality testing, supporting serious games as a scalable, engaging, and less biased alternative for career assessment."}

Other measures, which are based on Rényi divergences instead of von Neumann entropy, were suggested as alternatives in a recent paper showing them to possess important theoretical features, and making them leading candidates as mutual information measures. In this work, we concentrate on the maximal Rényi divergence. This measure can be shown to be the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. To calculate it efficiently for a 1D state represented as a matrix product state, we develop a generalized eigenvalue version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We benchmark our method for the paradigmatic XXZ chain, and show that the maximal Rényi divergence may exhibit different trends than the von Neumann mutual information."}

Traditional digital divide frameworks fail to explain these variations.\n  Purpose: This study introduces the \"Dependency Divide\", a novel framework proposing that highly engaged students become conditionally vulnerable to infrastructure failures, challenging assumptions that engagement uniformly benefits learners in post-access environments.\n  Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 396 university students in Bangladesh using a three-stage analytical approach: (1) stability-validated K-prototypes clustering to identify student profiles, (2) profile-specific Random Forest models with SHAP and ALE analysis to determine satisfaction drivers, and (3) formal interaction analysis with propensity score matching to test the Dependency Divide hypothesis.\n  Results: Three distinct profiles emerged: Casually Engaged (58%), Efficient Learners (35%), and Hyper-Engaged (7%). A significant interaction between educational device time and internet reliability (\\b{eta} = 0.033, p = 0.028) confirmed the Dependency Divide: engagement increased satisfaction only when infrastructure remained reliable. Hyper-Engaged students showed greatest vulnerability despite or because of their sophisticated digital workflows. Policy simulations demonstrated that targeted reliability improvements for high-dependency users yielded 2.06 times greater returns than uniform interventions.\n  Conclusions: In fragile infrastructure contexts, capability can become liability. Digital transformation policies must prioritize reliability for dependency-prone users, establish contingency systems, and educate students about dependency risks rather than uniformly promoting engagement."}

Here we present a doubly-connected gradiometric transmon (the ``8-mon\") that incorporates a nano-airbridge to link its two loops. This design preserves full electrical tunability and remains fully compatible with standard X-mon control and readout, requiring no additional measurement overhead. The airbridge interconnect eliminates dielectric loss, which enables the 8-mon to achieve both energy relaxation times $T_{\\rm 1}$ comparable to reference X-mons and, in the small flux-bias regime, a nearly threefold enhancement in Ramsey coherence time $T_{\\rm 2}^*$. This improved $T_{\\rm 2}^*$ reaches the same order as $T_{\\rm 1}$ without employing echo decoupling. The device also exhibits superior long-term frequency stability even without any magnetic field shielding. We develop a spatially correlated flux-noise model whose simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental coherence trends, revealing the coexistence of short- and long-correlation-length magnetic noise in the superconducting chip environment. By unifying high tunability with intrinsic flux-noise suppression through a robust geometric design, the 8-mon provides a practical pathway toward more coherent and stable superconducting quantum processors."}

The proposed method utilizes a deep neural network with a binarized sensing layer that learns by compressed learning a succinct but consequential seismic acquisition layout from a large corpus of subsurface models. Thus, given a large seismic data set to invert, the trained network selects a smaller subset of the data, then by using representation learning, an autoencoder computes latent representations of the data, followed by K-means clustering of the latent representations to further select the most relevant data for FWI. Effectively, this approach can be seen as a hierarchical selection. The proposed approach consistently outperforms random data sampling, even when utilizing only 10% of the data for 2D FWI, these results pave the way to accelerating FWI in large scale 3D inversion."}

In a limit of dilute atomic gas, the dynamics of each atom follows the Mollow-type nonlinear excitation regime, and the medium susceptibility collectivizes the individual atomic responses to the probe mode.

(2) If so, which classifiers are closer, those based on gradient descent (GD) or those based on k-nearest neighbors (kNN)? (3) When they do not behave similarly, what conditions are associated with differences in behavior? Using text classification as a use case, with six datasets and three LLMs, we observe that LLMs behave similarly to these classifiers when the relevance of demonstrations is high. On average, ICL is closer to kNN than logistic regression, giving empirical evidence that the attention mechanism behaves more similarly to kNN than GD.

This paper presents LLMize, an open-source Python framework that enables LLM-driven optimization through iterative prompting and in-context learning.

The framework supports multiple optimization strategies, including Optimization by Prompting (OPRO) and hybrid LLM-based methods inspired by evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. A key advantage of LLMize is the ability to inject constraints, rules, and domain knowledge directly through natural language descriptions, allowing practitioners to define complex optimization problems without requiring expertise in mathematical programming or metaheuristic design. LLMize is evaluated on convex optimization, linear programming, the Traveling Salesman Problem, neural network hyperparameter tuning, and nuclear fuel lattice optimization. Results show that while LLM-based optimization is not competitive with classical solvers for simple problems, it provides a practical and accessible approach for complex, domain-specific tasks where constraints and heuristics are difficult to formalize."}

Yet classical Barron spaces $\\mathscr{B}^{s+1}$ still require stronger regularity than Sobolev spaces $H^s$, and existing depth-sensitive results often assume constraints such as $sL \\le 1/2$. In this paper, we introduce a log-weighted Barron space $\\mathscr{B}^{\\log}$, which requires a strictly weaker assumption than $\\mathscr{B}^s$ for any $s>0$. For this new function space, we first study embedding properties and carry out a statistical analysis via the Rademacher complexity. Then we prove that functions in $\\mathscr{B}^{\\log}$ can be approximated by deep ReLU networks with explicit depth dependence. We then define a family $\\mathscr{B}^{s,\\log}$, establish approximation bounds in the $H^1$ norm, and identify maximal depth scales under which these rates are preserved.

However, despite its power, the standard attention mechanism is plagued by well-documented issues: representational collapse and attention sink. Although prior work has proposed approaches for these issues, they are often studied in isolation, obscuring their deeper connection. In this paper, we present a unified perspective, arguing that both can be traced to a common root -- improper attention allocation. We identify two failure modes: 1) Attention Overload, where tokens receive comparable high weights, blurring semantic features that lead to representational collapse; 2) Attention Underload, where no token is semantically relevant, yet attention is still forced to distribute, resulting in spurious focus such as attention sink. Building on this insight, we introduce Lazy Attention, a novel mechanism designed for a more focused attention distribution. To mitigate overload, it employs positional discrimination across both heads and dimensions to sharpen token distinctions. To counteract underload, it incorporates Elastic-Softmax, a modified normalization function that relaxes the standard softmax constraint to suppress attention on irrelevant tokens. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu corpus, evaluated across nine diverse benchmarks, demonstrate that Lazy Attention successfully mitigates attention sink and achieves competitive performance compared to both standard attention and modern architectures, while reaching up to 59.58% attention sparsity."}

For pure bipartite states, the witnesses yield lower bounds on entanglement measures, thereby outperforming most linear steering inequalities in the pure-state regime.

A central requirement of $μ$P is the satisfaction of certain spectral conditions on weight matrices, which ensure consistent feature learning and optimization behavior as model width grows. While these conditions are well understood in theory, guaranteeing their validity in practical training for matrix-based optimizers such as Muon is still under studied. Existing works that study Muon under $μ$P exhibit important limitations: they either do not ensure that the spectral conditions hold throughout the entire training horizon, or require repeated spectral normalization (or Newton-Schulz iterations) applied to both weights and updates, leading to significant computational overhead and reduced practicality. In this work, we show how to reliably guarantee the spectral conditions required by $μ$P for Muon during the entire training process. Our key insight is that for moderately large models, maintaining spectral control at the level of optimizer updates alone is sufficient to preserve $μ$P-compatible scaling, eliminating the need for explicit spectral normalization of the weights. Based on this principle, we develop a variant of Muon, namely Muon++, that satisfies spectral condition throughout the training process. Our results bridge the gap between the theoretical promises of $μ$P and the practical deployment of matrix-based optimizers in long-horizon training. We also take the first step towards an adaptive spectral condition by incorporating data-dependent effects, making it better suited for long-horizon LLM training."}

However, existing approaches often struggle to balance efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, particularly when handling long-range dependencies and irregularly sampled data. To address these challenges, we propose MODE, a unified framework that integrates Low-Rank Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) with an Enhanced Mamba architecture. As illustrated in our framework, the input sequence is first transformed by a Linear Tokenization Layer and then processed through multiple Mamba Encoder blocks, each equipped with an Enhanced Mamba Layer that employs Causal Convolution, SiLU activation, and a Low-Rank Neural ODE enhancement to efficiently capture temporal dynamics. This low-rank formulation reduces computational overhead while maintaining expressive power. Furthermore, a segmented selective scanning mechanism, inspired by pseudo-ODE dynamics, adaptively focuses on salient subsequences to improve scalability and long-range sequence modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODE surpasses existing baselines in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, our contributions include: (1) a unified and efficient architecture for long-term time series modeling, (2) integration of Mamba's selective scanning with low-rank Neural ODEs for enhanced temporal representation, and (3) substantial improvements in efficiency and scalability enabled by low-rank approximation and dynamic selective scanning."}

While this perspective captures an important constraint on adiabatic runtimes, it does not fully describe the global structure of spectral evolution in optimization problems with degenerate solution manifolds. In this work, we show that degeneracy alone imposes unavoidable global constraints on spectral flow, even in instances where adiabatic algorithms succeed with high probability. Focusing on digitized quantum adiabatic evolutions, we analyze the eigenphases of the cumulative unitary operator generated along the interpolation path. By explicitly tracking eigenphase trajectories, we demonstrate that multiple spectral bands are forced to interact, braid, and permute before coalescing into a degenerate manifold at the end of the evolution. This global reordering manifests as persistent spectral congestion and nontrivial band permutations that cannot be removed by increasing evolution time or refining the digitization. Using MaxCut instances with controlled degeneracy as a concrete setting, we extract quantitative diagnostics of spectral congestion and explicitly compute the induced band permutations. Our results show that successful adiabatic optimization can coexist with complex and constrained spectral flow, revealing a form of topological obstruction rooted in the global connectivity of eigenstates rather than in local gap closures. These findings highlight intrinsic limitations of gap-based analyses and motivate spectral-flow-based diagnostics for understanding adiabatic algorithms in degenerate optimization landscapes."}

Uniquely, GM-MLG pioneers transforming ADR prediction from multi-label classification into Transformer Decoder-based multi-label generation. By treating ADR labels as discrete token sequences, it employs positional embeddings to explicitly capture dependencies and co-occurrence relationships within large-scale label spaces, generating predictions via autoregressive decoding to dynamically expand the prediction space. Experiments demonstrate GM-MLG achieves up to 38% improvement and an average gain of 20%, expanding the prediction space from 200 to over 10,000 types.

This is critical for assessing the service life of civil infrastructure subjected to aggressive environments. The adopted methodology relies on several simple and complex standalone machine learning (ML) algorithms, with the primary objective of establishing confidence in the unbiased prediction of the underlying hidden correlations. The simple algorithms include linear regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). The complex algorithms entail support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and two families of artificial neural networks, including a feedforward network (multilayer perceptron, MLP) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The MLP architecture cannot explicitly handle sequential data, a limitation addressed by the GRU. A comprehensive dataset is considered. The performance of ML algorithms is evaluated, with KRR, GPR, and MLP exhibiting high accuracy. Given the diversity of the adopted concrete mixture proportions, the GRU was unable to accurately reproduce the response in the test set. Further analyses elucidate the contributions of mixture compositions to the temporal evolution of chloride. The results obtained from the GPR model unravel latent correlations through clear and explainable trends. The MLP, SVR, and KRR also provide acceptable estimates of the overall trends. The majority of mixture components exhibit an inverse relation with chloride content, while a few components demonstrate a direct correlation.

Existing explanations largely attribute this phenomenon to optimization instability or vanishing gradients, yet such accounts fail to explain why collapse persists even under modern normalization and initialization schemes. In this paper, we argue that the collapse of deep Transformers is fundamentally a geometric problem. Standard residual updates implicitly assume that feature accumulation is always beneficial, but offer no mechanism to constrain update directions or to erase outdated information. As depth increases, this leads to systematic drift off the semantic manifold and monotonic feature accumulation, causing representational degeneracy. We propose a unified geometric framework that addresses these failures through two orthogonal principles. First, manifold-constrained hyper-connections restrict residual updates to valid local tangent directions, preventing uncontrolled manifold drift. Second, deep delta learning introduces data-dependent, non-monotonic updates that enable reflection and erasure of redundant features rather than their unconditional accumulation. Together, these mechanisms decouple the direction and sign of feature updates, yielding a stable geometric evolution across depth. We term the resulting architecture the Manifold-Geometric Transformer (MGT).

We identify and analyze several extensions of Jarzynski's inequality that go beyond its direct derivation from the Jarzynski equality.

The diverse and rapidly evolving data patterns pose significant challenges for online anomaly detection. Many existing anomaly detection methods are designed for offline settings or have difficulty in handling heterogeneous streaming data effectively. This paper proposes GDME, an unsupervised graph-based framework for online time series anomaly detection using model ensemble. GDME maintains a dynamic model pool that is continuously updated by pruning underperforming models and introducing new ones. It utilizes a dynamic graph structure to represent relationships among models and employs community detection on the graph to select an appropriate subset for ensemble. The graph structure is also used to detect concept drift by monitoring structural changes, allowing the framework to adapt to evolving streaming data. Experiments on seven heterogeneous time series demonstrate that GDME outperforms existing online anomaly detection methods, achieving improvements of up to 24%. In addition, its ensemble strategy provides superior detection performance compared with both individual models and average ensembles, with competitive computational efficiency."}

The unbounded nature of the hopping places the model outside the scope of the Simon-Spencer theorem, while the staggered scaling allows it to evade broader constraints on Jacobi matrices. We analytically derive the bulk spectrum in reciprocal space, identifying a sharp ME where the energy magnitude equals the inter-cell hopping strength. This edge separates a continuum of extended states from two distinct localized branches: a standard unbounded Wannier-Stark ladder and an anomalous bounded branch accumulating at the ME. The existence of extended states is supported by finite-size scaling of the inverse participation ratio up to system sizes $L \\sim 10^9$.

In this work, we introduce 'Flow Equivariant World Models', a framework in which both self-motion and external object motion are unified as one-parameter Lie group 'flows'. We leverage this unification to implement group equivariance with respect to these transformations, thereby providing a stable latent world representation over hundreds of timesteps. On both 2D and 3D partially observed video world modeling benchmarks, we demonstrate that Flow Equivariant World Models significantly outperform comparable state-of-the-art diffusion-based and memory-augmented world modeling architectures -- particularly when there are predictable world dynamics outside the agent's current field of view. We show that flow equivariance is particularly beneficial for long rollouts, generalizing far beyond the training horizon. By structuring world model representations with respect to internal and external motion, flow equivariance charts a scalable route to data efficient, symmetry-guided, embodied intelligence.

These bounds are intrinsically data- and algorithm-dependent so that one can exploit the properties of data and algorithm to derive tighter bounds. However, we observe that although the flatness bias is crucial for SGD's generalization, these bounds fail to capture the improved generalization under better flatness and are also numerically loose. This is caused by the inadequate leverage of SGD's flatness bias in existing IT bounds. This paper derives a more flatness-leveraging IT bound for the flatness-favoring SGD. The bound indicates the learned models generalize better if the large-variance directions of the final weight covariance have small local curvatures in the loss landscape. Experiments on deep neural networks show our bound not only correctly reflects the better generalization when flatness is improved, but is also numerically much tighter. This is achieved by a flexible technique called \"omniscient trajectory\". When applied to Gradient Descent's minimax excess risk on convex-Lipschitz-Bounded problems, it improves representative IT bounds' $Ω(1)$ rates to $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$.

A crucial component of GNNs is the pooling procedure, in which the node features calculated by the model are combined to form an informative final descriptor to be used for the downstream task. However, previous graph pooling schemes rely on the last GNN layer features as an input to the pooling or classifier layers, potentially under-utilizing important activations of previous layers produced during the forward pass of the model, which we regard as historical graph activations. This gap is particularly pronounced in cases where a node's representation can shift significantly over the course of many graph neural layers, and worsened by graph-specific challenges such as over-smoothing in deep architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce HISTOGRAPH, a novel two-stage attention-based final aggregation layer that first applies a unified layer-wise attention over intermediate activations, followed by node-wise attention. By modeling the evolution of node representations across layers, our HISTOGRAPH leverages both the activation history of nodes and the graph structure to refine features used for final prediction. Empirical results on multiple graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that HISTOGRAPH offers strong performance that consistently improves traditional techniques, with particularly strong robustness in deep GNNs."}

Consequently, a family of entities forms a chain of items sharing overlapping traits. This philosophical idea naturally lends itself to a graph-based approach in machine learning. Accordingly, we propose the Wittgenstein's Family Resemblance (WFR) clustering algorithm and its kernel variant, kernel WFR. This algorithm computes resemblance scores between neighboring data instances, and after thresholding these scores, a resemblance graph is constructed. The connected components of this graph define the resulting clusters.

However, the estimation error of diffusion models suffers from the curse of dimensionality $n^{-1/D}$ with the data dimension $D$. Since images are usually a union of low-dimensional manifolds, current works model the data as a union of linear subspaces with Gaussian latent and achieve a $1/\\sqrt{n}$ bound. Though this modeling reflects the multi-manifold property, the Gaussian latent can not capture the multi-modal property of the latent manifold. To bridge this gap, we propose the mixture subspace of low-rank mixture of Gaussian (MoLR-MoG) modeling, which models the target data as a union of $K$ linear subspaces, and each subspace admits a mixture of Gaussian latent ($n_k$ modals with dimension $d_k$). With this modeling, the corresponding score function naturally has a mixture of expert (MoE) structure, captures the multi-modal information, and contains nonlinear property. We first conduct real-world experiments to show that the generation results of MoE-latent MoG NN are much better than MoE-latent Gaussian score. Furthermore, MoE-latent MoG NN achieves a comparable performance with MoE-latent Unet with $10 \\times$ parameters. These results indicate that the MoLR-MoG modeling is reasonable and suitable for real-world data. After that, based on such MoE-latent MoG score, we provide a $R^4\\sqrt{Σ_{k=1}^Kn_k}\\sqrt{Σ_{k=1}^Kn_kd_k}/\\sqrt{n}$ estimation error, which escapes the curse of dimensionality by using data structure. Finally, we study the optimization process and prove the convergence guarantee under the MoLR-MoG modeling.

Although existing methods infer value relationships from within-dataset co-occurrence patterns, such inference becomes unreliable when samples are limited, leaving the semantic context of the data underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present ARISE (Attention-weighted Representation with Integrated Semantic Embeddings), which draws on external semantic knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic-aware representations that complement the metric space of categorical data for accurate clustering.

We study two regimes: $(i)$ when the teacher provides the exact Bayes Class Probabilities (BCPs); and $(ii)$ supervision with noisy approximations of the BCPs. Our analysis shows that learning from BCPs yields variance reduction and removes neighborhood terms in the convergence bounds compared to one-hot supervision. We further characterize how the level of noise affects generalization and accuracy. Motivated by these insights, we advocate the use of Bayesian deep learning models, which typically provide improved estimates of the BCPs, as teachers in KD.

Modeling their global activity on large timescales is therefore a critical yet challenging task. While deep learning has recently achieved significant breakthroughs in global weather forecasting, its potential for global wildfire behavior prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we reframe this problem and introduce the Hierarchical Graph ODE (HiGO), a novel framework designed to learn the multi-scale, continuous-time dynamics of wildfires. Specifically, we represent the Earth system as a multi-level graph hierarchy and propose an adaptive filtering message passing mechanism for both intra- and inter-level information flow, enabling more effective feature extraction and fusion. Furthermore, we incorporate GNN-parameterized Neural ODE modules at multiple levels to explicitly learn the continuous dynamics inherent to each scale. Through extensive experiments on the SeasFire Cube dataset, we demonstrate that HiGO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-range wildfire forecasting. Moreover, its continuous-time predictions exhibit strong observational consistency, highlighting its potential for real-world applications."}

The rotations and reflections that preserve Euclidean geometry. Second, it is established that this framework achieves O(N) complexity per snapshot while providing cell-level spatial localization of distributional change.

However, current methods remain impeded by drug data scarcity-induced cold-start challenge, closed label sets, and inadequate modeling of label dependencies. Here we propose an open-ended ADR prediction paradigm based on Graph-Motif feature fusion and Multi-Label Generation (GM-MLG). Leveraging molecular structure as an intrinsic and inherent feature, GM-MLG constructs a dual-graph representation architecture spanning the atomic level, the local molecular level (utilizing fine-grained motifs dynamically extracted via the BRICS algorithm combined with additional fragmentation rules), and the global molecular level. Uniquely, GM-MLG pioneers transforming ADR prediction from multi-label classification into Transformer Decoder-based multi-label generation. By treating ADR labels as discrete token sequences, it employs positional embeddings to explicitly capture dependencies and co-occurrence relationships within large-scale label spaces, generating predictions via autoregressive decoding to dynamically expand the prediction space. Experiments demonstrate GM-MLG achieves up to 38% improvement and an average gain of 20%, expanding the prediction space from 200 to over 10,000 types. Furthermore, it elucidates non-linear structure-activity relationships between ADRs and motifs via retrosynthetic motif analysis, providing interpretable and innovative support for systematic risk reduction in drug safety."}

When working on the model induction, selecting the right architecture for a given dataset often relies on repetitive trial-and-error procedures. This procedure is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and difficult to automate. While previous work has explored performance prediction using partial training or complex simulations, these methods often require significant computational overhead or lack generalizability. In this work, we propose an alternative approach: a lightweight, two-stage framework that can estimate model performance before training given the understanding of the dataset and the focused deep model structures. The first stage predicts a baseline based on the analysis of some measurable properties of the dataset, while the second stage adjusts the estimation with additional information on the model's architectural and hyperparameter details. The setup allows the framework to generalize across datasets and model types. Moreover, we find that some of the underlying features used for prediction - such as dataset variance - can offer practical guidance for model selection, and can serve as early indicators of data quality. As a result, the framework can be used not only to forecast model performance, but also to guide architecture choices, inform necessary preprocessing procedures, and detect potentially problematic datasets before training begins."}

A hardware setup comprising voltage and current sensors, Arduino Mega and ESP8266 was developed to capture aggregate and individual load data, which was stored and processed on cloud platforms. A new dataset was created from three identical induction motors and auxiliary loads, totaling over 180,000 samples, to evaluate the state-of-the-art MATNILM model under challenging industrial conditions. Results indicate that while aggregate energy estimation was reasonably accurate, per-appliance disaggregation faced difficulties, particularly when multiple identical machines operated simultaneously. Despite these challenges, the integrated system demonstrated practical real-time monitoring with remote accessibility through the Blynk application. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of NILM in industrial contexts, offering insights into future improvements such as higher-frequency data collection, larger-scale datasets and advanced deep learning approaches for handling identical loads."}

Furthermore, a Reference-free Multi-task Graph Learning (RMGL) model is designed for robust power flow prediction. Unlike existing approaches, RMGL predicts bus voltages and branch powers instead of phase angles. This design not only avoids the risk of error amplification in branch power calculation but also guides the model to learn the physical relationships of phase angle differences. In addition, the loss function incorporates extra terms that encourage the model to capture the physical patterns of angle differences and power transmission, further improving consistency between predictions and physical laws.

However, existing methods typically assume full client availability, which is rarely practical. In real-world FL systems, clients often participate in a cyclic manner: joining training according to a fixed, repeating schedule. This setting poses unique optimization challenges for the non-decomposable AUC objective. This paper addresses these challenges by developing and analyzing communication-efficient algorithms for federated AUC maximization under cyclic client participation. We investigate two key settings: First, we study AUC maximization with a squared surrogate loss, which reformulates the problem as a nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization. By leveraging the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition, we establish a state-of-the-art communication complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/ε^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/ε)$. Second, we consider general pairwise AUC losses. We establish a communication complexity of $O(1/ε^3)$ and an iteration complexity of $O(1/ε^4)$. Further, under the PL condition, these bounds improve to communication complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/ε^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/ε)$. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks in image classification, medical imaging, and fraud detection demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed methods."}

GDME maintains a dynamic model pool that is continuously updated by pruning underperforming models and introducing new ones. It utilizes a dynamic graph structure to represent relationships among models and employs community detection on the graph to select an appropriate subset for ensemble. The graph structure is also used to detect concept drift by monitoring structural changes, allowing the framework to adapt to evolving streaming data. Experiments on seven heterogeneous time series demonstrate that GDME outperforms existing online anomaly detection methods, achieving improvements of up to 24%. In addition, its ensemble strategy provides superior detection performance compared with both individual models and average ensembles, with competitive computational efficiency."}

Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century.

However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks.

However, evaluating these systems is challenging, as it requires realistic, end-to-end research scenarios that integrate data analysis, interpretation, and the generation of new insights from the experimental data. To address this limitation, we introduce HeurekaBench, a framework to create benchmarks with exploratory, open-ended research questions for experimental datasets. Each such question is grounded in a scientific study and its corresponding code repository, and is created using a semi-automated pipeline that leverages multiple LLMs to extract insights and generate candidate workflows, which are then verified against reported findings. We instantiate the framework in single-cell biology to obtain sc-HeurekaBench benchmark and use it to compare state-of-the-art single-cell agents. We further showcase the benefits of our benchmark for quantitatively analyzing current design choices in agentic systems. We find that the addition of a critic module can improve ill-formed responses for open-source LLM-based agents by up to 22% and close the gap with their closed-source counterparts. Overall, HeurekaBench sets a path toward rigorous, end-to-end evaluation of scientific agents, grounding benchmark construction in real scientific workflows."}

Deep learning-based Radar Echo Extrapolation (REE) has become a predominant nowcasting approach, yet it suffers from poor generalization due to its reliance on high-quality local training data and static model parameters, limiting its applicability across diverse regions and extreme events. To overcome this, we propose REE-TTT, a novel model that incorporates an adaptive Test-Time Training (TTT) mechanism. The core of our model lies in the newly designed Spatio-temporal Test-Time Training (ST-TTT) block, which replaces the standard linear projections in TTT layers with task-specific attention mechanisms, enabling robust adaptation to non-stationary meteorological distributions and thereby significantly enhancing the feature representation of precipitation. Experiments under cross-regional extreme precipitation scenarios demonstrate that REE-TTT substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in prediction accuracy and generalization, exhibiting remarkable adaptability to data distribution shifts."}

We propose DiMEx, a framework that weaponizes the rich semantic priors of pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models to bypass this initialization barrier entirely. By employing Random Embedding Bayesian Optimization (REMBO) within the generator's latent space, DiMEx synthesizes high-fidelity queries immediately, achieving 52.1 percent agreement on SVHN with just 2,000 queries - outperforming state-of-the-art GAN baselines by over 16 percent. To counter this highly semantic threat, we introduce the Hybrid Stateful Ensemble (HSE) defense, which identifies the unique \"optimization trajectory\" of latent-space attacks. Our results demonstrate that while DiMEx evades static distribution detectors, HSE exploits this temporal signature to suppress attack success rates to 21.6 percent with negligible latency."}

Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century. Nowadays, they regulate markets, provide an engine for modern recommender systems or peer-to-peer networks, and remain the main approach to represent democracy. However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks. We believe this opens new frontiers for applying machine learning to real-world elections."}

However, the efficiency of these prediction sets, measured by their size, depends on the choice of the underlying learning model. Relying on a single fixed model may lead to suboptimal performance in online environments, as a single model may not consistently perform well across all time steps. To mitigate this, prior work has explored selecting a model from a set of candidates. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive as the number of candidate models increases. Moreover, poorly performing models in the set may also hinder the effectiveness. To tackle this challenge, this work develops a novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that reduces computational complexity and improves prediction efficiency. At each time step, a bipartite graph is generated to identify a subset of effective models, from which a model is selected to construct the prediction set.

EPIC explicitly regulates the amount of uncertainty expressed at every step of generation, aligning the sampling distribution's entropy to the aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Through Entropy-Aware Lazy Gumbel-Max sampling, EPIC manages to be exact, while also being efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of entropy evaluations per step. Unlike current baselines, EPIC yields sampling distributions that are empirically well-aligned with the entropy of the underlying data distribution. Across creative writing and summarization tasks, EPIC consistently improves LM-as-judge preference win-rates over widely used decoding strategies. These preference gains are complemented by automatic metrics, showing that EPIC produces more diverse generations and more faithful summaries. We also evaluate EPIC on mathematical reasoning, where it outperforms all baselines."}

In fact, under standard complexity conjectures, standard transformers cannot recognize context-free languages (CFLs), a canonical formalism to describe syntax, or even regular languages, a subclass of CFLs (Merrill et al., 2022). Merrill & Sabharwal (2024) show that $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ looping layers (w.r.t. input length $n$) allows transformers to recognize regular languages, but the question of context-free recognition remained open. In this work, we show that looped transformers with $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ looping layers and $\\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens can recognize all CFLs. However, training and inference with $\\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens is potentially impractical. Fortunately, we show that, for natural subclasses such as unambiguous CFLs, the recognition problem on transformers becomes more tractable, requiring $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ padding. We empirically validate our results and show that looping helps on a language that provably requires logarithmic depth. Overall, our results shed light on the intricacy of CFL recognition by transformers: While general recognition may require an intractable amount of padding, natural constraints such as unambiguity yield efficient recognition algorithms."}

In response, regulations such as European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandate the deletion of PII upon requests, underscoring the need for reliable and cost-effective data removal solutions. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising direction for selectively forgetting data points. However, existing unlearning techniques typically apply a uniform forgetting strategy that neither accounts for the varying privacy risks posed by different PII attributes nor reflects associated business risks. In this work, we propose UnPII, the first PII-centric unlearning approach that prioritizes forgetting based on the risk of individual or combined PII attributes. To this end, we introduce the PII risk index (PRI), a composite metric that incorporates multiple dimensions of risk factors: identifiability, sensitivity, usability, linkability, permanency, exposability, and compliancy. The PRI enables a nuanced evaluation of privacy risks associated with PII exposures and can be tailored to align with organizational privacy policies. To support realistic assessment, we systematically construct a synthetic PII dataset (e.g., 1,700 PII instances) that simulates realistic exposure scenarios. UnPII seamlessly integrates with established unlearning algorithms, such as Gradient Ascent, Negative Preference Optimization, and Direct Preference Optimization, without modifying their underlying principles. Our experimental results demonstrate that UnPII achieves the improvements of accuracy up to 11.8%, utility up to 6.3%, and generalizability up to 12.4%, respectively, while incurring a modest fine-tuning overhead of 27.5% on average during unlearning."}

In continuous control tasks, even small parameter shifts can produce unstable gaits, complicating both algorithm comparison and real-world transfer. Previous work has shown that such instability arises when policy updates traverse noisy neighborhoods and that the spread of post-update return distribution $R(θ)$, obtained by repeatedly sampling minibatches, updating $θ$, and measuring final returns, is a useful indicator of this noise. Although explicitly constraining the policy to maintain a narrow $R(θ)$ can improve stability, directly estimating $R(θ)$ is computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. We propose an alternative that takes advantage of environmental stochasticity to mitigate update-induced variability. Specifically, we model state-action return distribution through a distributional critic and then bias the advantage function of PPO using higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of this distribution. By penalizing extreme tail behaviors, our method discourages policies from entering parameter regimes prone to instability. We hypothesize that in environments where post-update critic values align poorly with post-update returns, standard PPO struggles to produce a narrow $R(θ)$. In such cases, our moment-based correction narrows $R(θ)$, improving stability by up to 75% in Walker2D, while preserving comparable evaluation returns."}

To address these critical limitations of scalability and fault-tolerance, we present a distributed approach to federated learning comprising multiple servers with inter-server communication capabilities. While providing a fully decentralized approach, the designed framework retains the core federated learning structure where each server is associated with a disjoint set of clients with server-client communication capabilities. We propose a novel DFL (Distributed Federated Learning) algorithm which uses alternating periods of local training on the client data followed by global training among servers.

In continuous control tasks, even small parameter shifts can produce unstable gaits, complicating both algorithm comparison and real-world transfer. Previous work has shown that such instability arises when policy updates traverse noisy neighborhoods and that the spread of post-update return distribution $R(θ)$, obtained by repeatedly sampling minibatches, updating $θ$, and measuring final returns, is a useful indicator of this noise. Although explicitly constraining the policy to maintain a narrow $R(θ)$ can improve stability, directly estimating $R(θ)$ is computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. We propose an alternative that takes advantage of environmental stochasticity to mitigate update-induced variability. Specifically, we model state-action return distribution through a distributional critic and then bias the advantage function of PPO using higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of this distribution. By penalizing extreme tail behaviors, our method discourages policies from entering parameter regimes prone to instability. We hypothesize that in environments where post-update critic values align poorly with post-update returns, standard PPO struggles to produce a narrow $R(θ)$. In such cases, our moment-based correction narrows $R(θ)$, improving stability by up to 75% in Walker2D, while preserving comparable evaluation returns."}

We introduce RealPDEBench, the first benchmark for scientific ML that integrates real-world measurements with paired numerical simulations. RealPDEBench consists of five datasets, three tasks, eight metrics, and ten baselines. We first present five real-world measured datasets with paired simulated datasets across different complex physical systems. We further define three tasks, which allow comparisons between real-world and simulated data, and facilitate the development of methods to bridge the two. Moreover, we design eight evaluation metrics, spanning data-oriented and physics-oriented metrics, and finally benchmark ten representative baselines, including state-of-the-art models, pretrained PDE foundation models, and a traditional method. Experiments reveal significant discrepancies between simulated and real-world data, while showing that pretraining with simulated data consistently improves both accuracy and convergence.

However, backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to FL. These attacks aim to implant a stealthy trigger into the global model, causing it to mislead on inputs that possess a specific trigger while functioning normally on benign data. Although pre-aggregation detection is a main defense direction, existing state-of-the-art defenses often rely on fixed defense parameters. This reliance makes them vulnerable to single-point-of-failure risks, rendering them less effective against sophisticated attackers. To address these limitations, we propose FAROS, an enhanced FL framework that incorporates Adaptive Differential Scaling (ADS) and Robust Core-set Computing (RCC). The ADS mechanism adjusts the defense's sensitivity dynamically, based on the dispersion of uploaded gradients by clients in each round. This allows it to counter attackers who strategically shift between stealthiness and effectiveness. Furthermore, the RCC effectively mitigates the risk of single-point failure by computing the centroid of a core set comprising clients with the highest confidence. We conducted extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and attack scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms current defenses in both attack success rate and main task accuracy."}

This motivates an instance-level audit problem: for a fine-tuned model and a training prompt-response pair, can we infer whether the model was trained on the original prompt or its LLM-refined version within a mixed corpus? This matters for dataset governance and dispute resolution when training data are contested. However, it is non-trivial in practice: refined and raw instances are interleaved in the training corpus with unknown, source-dependent mixture ratios, making it harder to develop provenance methods that generalize across models and training setups. In this paper, we formalize this audit task as Refinement Provenance Inference (RPI) and show that prompt refinement yields stable, detectable shifts in teacher-forced token distributions, even when semantic differences are not obvious. Building on this phenomenon, we propose RePro, a logit-based provenance framework that fuses teacher-forced likelihood features with logit-ranking signals. During training, RePro learns a transferable representation via shadow fine-tuning, and uses a lightweight linear head to infer provenance on unseen victims without training-data access. Empirically, RePro consistently attains strong performance and transfers well across refiners, suggesting that it exploits refiner-agnostic distribution shifts rather than rewrite-style artifacts."}

Existing methods enhance model compatibility with data heterogeneity by splitting models and knowledge distillation. However, they neglect the insufficient communication bandwidth and computing power on the client, failing to strike an effective balance between addressing data heterogeneity and accommodating limited client resources. To tackle this limitation, we propose a personalized federated learning method based on cosine sparsification parameter packing and dual-weighted aggregation (FedCSPACK), which effectively leverages the limited client resources and reduces the impact of data heterogeneity on model performance. In FedCSPACK, the client packages model parameters and selects the most contributing parameter packages for sharing based on cosine similarity, effectively reducing bandwidth requirements. The client then generates a mask matrix anchored to the shared parameter package to improve the alignment and aggregation efficiency of sparse updates on the server. Furthermore, directional and distribution distance weights are embedded in the mask to implement a weighted-guided aggregation mechanism, enhancing the robustness and generalization performance of the global model. Extensive experiments across four datasets using ten state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that FedCSPACK effectively improves communication and computational efficiency while maintaining high model accuracy."}

In this paper, we analyze the instability from the perspective of the output embeddings' geometry and identify its cause. Based on this, we propose output embedding centering (OEC) as a new mitigation strategy, and prove that it suppresses output logit divergence. OEC can be implemented in two different ways, as a deterministic operation called μ-centering, or a regularization method called μ-loss. Our experiments show that both variants outperform z-loss in terms of training stability and learning rate sensitivity. In particular, they ensure that training converges even for large learning rates when z-loss fails. Furthermore, we find that μ-loss is significantly less sensitive to regularization hyperparameter tuning than z-loss."}

In this paper, we define the epistasis detection problem as a black-box optimization problem and solve it with a factorization machine with quadratic optimization annealing (FMQA). We propose an efficient epistasis detection method based on FMQA, in which the classification error rate (CER) computed by MDR is used as a black-box objective function. Experimental evaluations were conducted using simulated case-control datasets with predefined high-order epistasis. The results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully identified ground-truth epistasis across various interaction orders and the numbers of genetic loci within a limited number of iterations.

We demonstrate that the maximum-entropy bias, typical of Sinkhorn-based projections, drives the mixing operator towards the uniform barycenter, thereby suppressing the subdominant singular value σ_2 and filtering out high-frequency feature components. We derive a spectral bound linking σ_2 to the network's effective depth, showing that high-entropy constraints restrict feature transformation to a shallow effective receptive field. Furthermore, we formally demonstrate that Layer Normalization fails to mitigate this collapse in noise-dominated regimes; specifically, when spectral filtering degrades the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) below a critical threshold, geometric structure is irreversibly lost to noise-induced orthogonal collapse. Our findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between entropic stability and spectral expressivity in DSM-constrained networks."}

Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs.

In sharp contrast, on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) effectively preserves general capabilities. We investigate this discrepancy and identify a fundamental distributional gap: while RL aligns with the model's internal belief, SFT forces the model to fit external supervision. This mismatch often manifests as \"Confident Conflicts\" tokens characterized by low probability but low entropy. In these instances, the model is highly confident in its own prediction but is forced to learn a divergent ground truth, triggering destructive gradient updates. To address this, we propose Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT). Unlike methods relying solely on prediction probability, EAFT utilizes token-level entropy as a gating mechanism to distinguish between epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflict. This allows the model to learn from uncertain samples while suppressing gradients on conflicting data. Extensive experiments on Qwen and GLM series (ranging from 4B to 32B parameters) across mathematical, medical, and agentic domains confirm our hypothesis. EAFT consistently matches the downstream performance of standard SFT while significantly mitigating the degradation of general capabilities."}

Despite a large body of work focused on training frontier vision-language models (VLMs), approaches to their evaluation remain nascent. To guide their maturation, we propose three desiderata that evaluations should satisfy: (1) faithfulness to the modality and application, (2) discriminability between models of varying quality, and (3) efficiency in compute. Through this lens, we identify critical failure modes that violate faithfulness and discriminability, misrepresenting model capabilities: (i) multiple-choice formats reward guessing, poorly reflect downstream use cases, and saturate early as models improve; (ii) blindly solvable questions, which can be answered without images, constitute up to 70% of some evaluations; and (iii) mislabeled or ambiguous samples compromise up to 42% of examples in certain datasets. Regarding efficiency, the computational burden of evaluating frontier models has become prohibitive: by some accounts, nearly 20% of development compute is devoted to evaluation alone. Rather than discarding existing benchmarks, we curate them via transformation and filtering to maximize fidelity and discriminability. We find that converting multiple-choice questions to generative tasks reveals sharp capability drops of up to 35%. In addition, filtering blindly solvable and mislabeled samples improves discriminative power while simultaneously reducing computational cost. We release DatBench-Full, a cleaned evaluation suite of 33 datasets spanning nine VLM capabilities, and DatBench, a discriminative subset that achieves 13x average speedup (up to 50x) while closely matching the discriminative power of the original datasets.

By removing dataset heterogeneity and packaging transparent, reusable evaluation scaffolding, SynRXN enables fair longitudinal comparison of CASP methods, supports rigorous ablations and stress tests along the full reaction-informatics pipeline, and lowers the barrier for practitioners who seek robust and comparable performance estimates for real-world synthesis planning workloads."}

This motivates an instance-level audit problem: for a fine-tuned model and a training prompt-response pair, can we infer whether the model was trained on the original prompt or its LLM-refined version within a mixed corpus? This matters for dataset governance and dispute resolution when training data are contested. However, it is non-trivial in practice: refined and raw instances are interleaved in the training corpus with unknown, source-dependent mixture ratios, making it harder to develop provenance methods that generalize across models and training setups. In this paper, we formalize this audit task as Refinement Provenance Inference (RPI) and show that prompt refinement yields stable, detectable shifts in teacher-forced token distributions, even when semantic differences are not obvious. Building on this phenomenon, we propose RePro, a logit-based provenance framework that fuses teacher-forced likelihood features with logit-ranking signals. During training, RePro learns a transferable representation via shadow fine-tuning, and uses a lightweight linear head to infer provenance on unseen victims without training-data access. Empirically, RePro consistently attains strong performance and transfers well across refiners, suggesting that it exploits refiner-agnostic distribution shifts rather than rewrite-style artifacts."}

In this work, we focus on a setting where domains share underlying structural patterns despite differences in their specific realizations. The task is particularly challenging in the absence of paired observations, which removes direct supervision across domains. We introduce a generative framework, called SerpentFlow (SharEd-structuRe decomPosition for gEnerative domaiN adapTation), for unpaired domain alignment. SerpentFlow decomposes data within a latent space into a shared component common to both domains and a domain-specific one. By isolating the shared structure and replacing the domain-specific component with stochastic noise, we construct synthetic training pairs between shared representations and target-domain samples, thereby enabling the use of conditional generative models that are traditionally restricted to paired settings. We apply this approach to super-resolution tasks, where the shared component naturally corresponds to low-frequency content while high-frequency details capture domain-specific variability. The cutoff frequency separating low- and high-frequency components is determined automatically using a classifier-based criterion, ensuring a data-driven and domain-adaptive decomposition. By generating pseudo-pairs that preserve low-frequency structures while injecting stochastic high-frequency realizations, we learn the conditional distribution of the target domain given the shared representation. We implement SerpentFlow using Flow Matching as the generative pipeline, although the framework is compatible with other conditional generative approaches. Experiments on synthetic images, physical process simulations, and a climate downscaling task demonstrate that the method effectively reconstructs high-frequency structures consistent with underlying low-frequency patterns, supporting shared-structure decomposition as an effective strategy for unpaired domain alignment."}

The most widely used mitigation strategy, z-loss, merely addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying cause of the problem. In this paper, we analyze the instability from the perspective of the output embeddings' geometry and identify its cause. Based on this, we propose output embedding centering (OEC) as a new mitigation strategy, and prove that it suppresses output logit divergence. OEC can be implemented in two different ways, as a deterministic operation called μ-centering, or a regularization method called μ-loss. Our experiments show that both variants outperform z-loss in terms of training stability and learning rate sensitivity. In particular, they ensure that training converges even for large learning rates when z-loss fails. Furthermore, we find that μ-loss is significantly less sensitive to regularization hyperparameter tuning than z-loss."}

The use of group-level rewards successfully aligns the model with the targeted reward. However, it faces challenges including low efficiency, dependency on stochastic samplers, and reward hacking. The problem is that rectified flow models are fundamentally different from LLMs: 1) For efficiency, online image sampling takes much more time and dominates the time of training. 2) For stochasticity, rectified flow is deterministic once the initial noise is fixed. Aiming at these problems and inspired by the effects of group-level rewards from LLMs, we design Group-level Direct Reward Optimization (GDRO). GDRO is a new post-training paradigm for group-level reward alignment that combines the characteristics of rectified flow models. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we point out that GDRO supports full offline training that saves the large time cost for image rollout sampling. Also, it is diffusion-sampler-independent, which eliminates the need for the ODE-to-SDE approximation to obtain stochasticity. We also empirically study the reward hacking trap that may mislead the evaluation, and involve this factor in the evaluation using a corrected score that not only considers the original evaluation reward but also the trend of reward hacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDRO effectively and efficiently improves the reward score of the diffusion model through group-wise offline optimization across the OCR and GenEval tasks, while demonstrating strong stability and robustness in mitigating reward hacking."}

To address these, we propose DMPEAD, a Dynamic Model Pool and Ensembling framework for MTS Anomaly Detection.

We demonstrate that the maximum-entropy bias, typical of Sinkhorn-based projections, drives the mixing operator towards the uniform barycenter, thereby suppressing the subdominant singular value σ_2 and filtering out high-frequency feature components. We derive a spectral bound linking σ_2 to the network's effective depth, showing that high-entropy constraints restrict feature transformation to a shallow effective receptive field. Furthermore, we formally demonstrate that Layer Normalization fails to mitigate this collapse in noise-dominated regimes; specifically, when spectral filtering degrades the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) below a critical threshold, geometric structure is irreversibly lost to noise-induced orthogonal collapse. Our findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between entropic stability and spectral expressivity in DSM-constrained networks."}

The traditional data subsampling method works as a static, task independent preprocessing step which usually discards information that is critical to downstream prediction. In this paper, we introduces the antagonistic soft selection subsampling (ASSS) framework as is a novel paradigm that reconstructs data reduction into a differentiable end-to-end learning problem. ASSS uses the adversarial game between selector network and task network, and selector network learning assigns continuous importance weights to samples. This direct optimization implemented by Gumbel-Softmax relaxation allows the selector to identify and retain samples with the maximum amount of information for a specific task target under the guidance of the loss function that balances the fidelity and sparsity of the prediction. Theoretical analysis links this framework with the information bottleneck principle. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale real world datasets show that ASSS has always been better than heuristic subsampling baselines such as clustering and nearest neighbor thinning in maintaining model performance. It is worth noting that ASSS can not only match, but also sometimes exceed the training performance of the entire dataset, showcasing the effect of intelligent denoising. This work establishes task aware data subsampling as a learnable component, providing a principled solution for effective large-scale data learning."}

To interpret forecasting models agnostic to the types of layers across state-of-the-art model families, we introduce Horizon Activation Mapping (HAM), a visual interpretability technique inspired by grad-CAM that uses gradient norm averages to study the horizon's subseries where grad-CAM studies attention maps over image data. We introduce causal and anti-causal modes to calculate gradient update norm averages across subseries at every timestep and lines of proportionality signifying uniform distributions of the norm averages. Optimization landscape studies with respect to changes in batch sizes, early stopping, train-val-test splits, univariate forecasting and dropouts are studied with respect to performances and subseries in HAM.

NHITS' neural approximation theorem and SpaceTime's exponential autoregressive activities have been attributed to trends in HAM plots over their training, validation and test sets. In general, HAM can be used for granular model selection, validation set choices and comparisons across different neural network model families."}

Our method constructs atom-level graphs and integrates multidimensional structural features, including geometric descriptors, DSSP-derived secondary structure, and relative solvent accessibility (RSA), to generate spatially aware embedding vectors.

In sharp contrast, on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) effectively preserves general capabilities. We investigate this discrepancy and identify a fundamental distributional gap: while RL aligns with the model's internal belief, SFT forces the model to fit external supervision. This mismatch often manifests as \"Confident Conflicts\" tokens characterized by low probability but low entropy. In these instances, the model is highly confident in its own prediction but is forced to learn a divergent ground truth, triggering destructive gradient updates. To address this, we propose Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT). Unlike methods relying solely on prediction probability, EAFT utilizes token-level entropy as a gating mechanism to distinguish between epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflict. This allows the model to learn from uncertain samples while suppressing gradients on conflicting data. Extensive experiments on Qwen and GLM series (ranging from 4B to 32B parameters) across mathematical, medical, and agentic domains confirm our hypothesis. EAFT consistently matches the downstream performance of standard SFT while significantly mitigating the degradation of general capabilities."}

These added points are constrained to be monotone corruptions, in that they get labeled according to the ground-truth target function. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that in this setting, all known optimal learning algorithms for binary classification can be made to achieve suboptimal expected error on a new independent test point drawn from the same distribution as the clean dataset.

Existing approaches are fundamentally limited: replay-based methods are impractical and privacy-violating, while strict orthogonality-based methods collapse under scale: each new task is projected onto an orthogonal complement, progressively reducing the residual degrees of freedom and eliminating forward transfer by forbidding overlap in shared representations. In this work, we introduce ELLA, a training framework built on the principle of selective subspace de-correlation. Rather than forbidding all overlap, ELLA explicitly characterizes the structure of past updates and penalizes alignments along their high-energy, task-specific directions, while preserving freedom in the low-energy residual subspaces to enable transfer. Formally, this is realized via a lightweight regularizer on a single aggregated update matrix. We prove this mechanism corresponds to an anisotropic shrinkage operator that bounds interference, yielding a penalty that is both memory- and compute-constant regardless of task sequence length. ELLA requires no data replay, no architectural expansion, and negligible storage. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art CL performance on three popular benchmarks, with relative accuracy gains of up to $9.6\\%$ and a $35\\times$ smaller memory footprint.

These specialized accelerators are not only prohibitively expensive and energy-intensive but also suffer from significant supply scarcity, limiting the ubiquity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment on edge devices. The core of this inefficiency stems from the standard artificial perceptron's dependence on intensive matrix multiplications. However, biological nervous systems achieve unparalleled efficiency without such arithmetic intensity; synaptic signal transmission is regulated by physical ion channel limits and chemical neurotransmitter levels rather than a process that can be analogous to arithmetic multiplication. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we propose Neuro-Channel Networks (NCN), a novel multiplication-free architecture designed to decouple AI from expensive hardware dependencies. In our model, weights are replaced with Channel Widths that physically limit the signal magnitude, while a secondary parameter acts as a Neurotransmitter to regulate Signal Transmission based on sign logic. The forward pass relies exclusively on addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations (minimum, sign), eliminating floating-point multiplication entirely. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that NCNs can solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR and the Majority function with 100% accuracy using standard backpropagation, proving their capability to form complex decision boundaries without multiplicative weights. This architecture offers a highly efficient alternative for next-generation neuromorphic hardware, paving the way for running complex models on commodity CPUs or ultra-low-power chips without relying on costly GPU clusters."}

We introduce POSEIDON (Physics-Optimized Seismic Energy Inference and Detection Operating Network), a physics-informed energy-based model for unified multi-task seismic event prediction, alongside the Poseidon dataset -- the largest open-source global earthquake catalog comprising 2.8 million events spanning 30 years. POSEIDON embeds fundamental seismological principles, including the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency relationship and Omori-Utsu aftershock decay law, as learnable constraints within an energy-based modeling framework. The architecture simultaneously addresses three interconnected prediction tasks: aftershock sequence identification, tsunami generation potential, and foreshock detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POSEIDON achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, outperforming gradient boosting, random forest, and CNN baselines with the highest average F1 score among all compared methods. Crucially, the learned physics parameters converge to scientifically interpretable values -- Gutenberg-Richter b-value of 0.752 and Omori-Utsu parameters p=0.835, c=0.1948 days -- falling within established seismological ranges while enhancing rather than compromising predictive accuracy.

It has been shown that hidden representations learned by deep models can encode sensitive information from the input, making it possible for adversaries to recover the input data with considerable accuracy. This problem is exacerbated in transformer embeddings because they consist of multiple vectors, one per token. To mitigate this risk, we propose Nonparametric Variational Differential Privacy (NVDP), which ensures both useful data sharing and strong privacy protection. We take a differential privacy approach, integrating a Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) layer into the transformer architecture to inject noise into its multi-vector embeddings and thereby hide information, and measuring privacy protection with Rényi divergence and its corresponding Bayesian Differential Privacy (BDP) guarantee. Training the NVIB layer calibrates the noise level according to utility. We test NVDP on the GLUE benchmark and show that varying the noise level gives us a useful tradeoff between privacy and accuracy. With lower noise levels, our model maintains high accuracy while offering strong privacy guarantees, effectively balancing privacy and utility."}

Alpha decay represents a significant challenge, with traditional models such as DeepLOB losing predictive power as the time horizon (k) increases. In this paper, using data from the FI-2010 dataset, we introduce Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (T-KAN) to replace the fixed, linear weights of standard LSTMs with learnable B-spline activation functions. This allows the model to learn the 'shape' of market signals as opposed to just their magnitude. This resulted in a 19.1% relative improvement in the F1-score at the k = 100 horizon. The efficacy of T-KAN networks cannot be understated, producing a 132.48% return compared to the -82.76% DeepLOB drawdown under 1.0 bps transaction costs. In addition to this, the T-KAN model proves quite interpretable, with the 'dead-zones' being clearly visible in the splines. The T-KAN architecture is also uniquely optimized for low-latency FPGA implementation via High level Synthesis (HLS).

Classical approaches assume a worst-case adversarial model and ensure error correction and data recovery only when the number of honest nodes exceeds the number of adversarial ones by some margin. However, in some emerging decentralized applications, particularly in decentralized machine learning (DeML), participating nodes are rewarded for accepted contributions. This incentive structure naturally gives rise to rational adversaries who act strategically rather than behaving in purely malicious ways.\n  In this paper, we first motivate the need for coding in the presence of rational adversaries, particularly in the context of outsourced computation in decentralized systems. We contrast this need with existing approaches and highlight their limitations. We then introduce the game of coding, a novel game-theoretic framework that extends coding theory to trust-minimized settings where honest nodes are not in the majority. Focusing on repetition coding, we highlight two key features of this framework: (1) the ability to achieve a non-zero probability of data recovery even when adversarial nodes are in the majority, and (2) Sybil resistance, i.e., the equilibrium remains unchanged even as the number of adversarial nodes increases. Finally, we explore scenarios in which the adversary's strategy is unknown and outline several open problems for future research."}

Despite a large body of work focused on training frontier vision-language models (VLMs), approaches to their evaluation remain nascent. To guide their maturation, we propose three desiderata that evaluations should satisfy: (1) faithfulness to the modality and application, (2) discriminability between models of varying quality, and (3) efficiency in compute. Through this lens, we identify critical failure modes that violate faithfulness and discriminability, misrepresenting model capabilities: (i) multiple-choice formats reward guessing, poorly reflect downstream use cases, and saturate early as models improve; (ii) blindly solvable questions, which can be answered without images, constitute up to 70% of some evaluations; and (iii) mislabeled or ambiguous samples compromise up to 42% of examples in certain datasets. Regarding efficiency, the computational burden of evaluating frontier models has become prohibitive: by some accounts, nearly 20% of development compute is devoted to evaluation alone. Rather than discarding existing benchmarks, we curate them via transformation and filtering to maximize fidelity and discriminability. We find that converting multiple-choice questions to generative tasks reveals sharp capability drops of up to 35%. In addition, filtering blindly solvable and mislabeled samples improves discriminative power while simultaneously reducing computational cost. We release DatBench-Full, a cleaned evaluation suite of 33 datasets spanning nine VLM capabilities, and DatBench, a discriminative subset that achieves 13x average speedup (up to 50x) while closely matching the discriminative power of the original datasets. Our work outlines a path toward evaluation practices that are both rigorous and sustainable as VLMs continue to scale."}

We study whether SparseLoCo, a low-communication data parallel method based on infrequent synchronization and sparse pseudo-gradient exchange, can be combined with low-bandwidth pipeline model parallelism via activation and activation-gradient compression. We introduce a heterogeneous distributed training framework where some participants host full replicas on high-bandwidth interconnects, while resource-limited participants are grouped to jointly instantiate a replica using pipeline parallelism with subspace-projected inter-stage communication. To make the recently introduced subspace pipeline compression compatible with SparseLoCo, we study a number of adaptations. Across large-scale language modeling experiments (178M-1B parameters) on standard pretraining corpora, we find that activation compression composes with SparseLoCo at modest cost, while selective (heterogeneous) compression consistently improves the loss-communication tradeoff relative to compressing all replicas-especially at aggressive compression ratios. These results suggest a practical path to incorporating low-bandwidth model parallelism and heterogeneous participants into LLM pre-training."}

UCL's structural overhead function O_s(A) explains version-specific performance differences through the Over-Specification Paradox: beyond threshold S* = 0.509, additional specification degrades performance quadratically. Core mechanisms -- indicator functions (I_i in {0,1}), structural overhead (O_s = gamma * sum(ln C_k)), early binding -- are validated. Notably, optimal UCL configuration varies by model architecture -- certain models (e.g., Llama 4 Scout) require version-specific adaptations (V4.1).

The advantage of RMCTS over AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB is speed. In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.\n  The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in \"Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization\" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.\n  The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node. This is a disadvantage, but the speedup advantage is more significant, and in practice we find that RMCTS-trained networks match the quality of MCTS-UCB-trained networks in roughly one-third of the training time. We include timing and quality comparisons of RMCTS vs. MCTS-UCB for three games: Connect-4, Dots-and-Boxes, and Othello."}

This paper intends to study search algorithms based on quantum walks in quantum computation and sampling algorithms based on Langevin dynamics in classical computation. On the quantum side, quantum walk-based search algorithms can achieve quadratic speedups over their classical counterparts. In classical computation, a substantial body of work has focused on gradient acceleration, with gradient-adjusted algorithms derived from underdamped Langevin dynamics providing quadratic acceleration over conventional Langevin algorithms.\n  Since both search and sampling algorithms are designed to address learning tasks, we study learning relationship between coined quantum walks and underdamped Langevin dynamics. Specifically, we show that, in terms of the Le Cam deficiency distance, a quantum walk with randomization is asymptotically equivalent to underdamped Langevin dynamics, whereas the quantum walk without randomization is not asymptotically equivalent due to its high-frequency oscillatory behavior. We further discuss the implications of these equivalence and nonequivalence results for the computational and inferential properties of the associated algorithms in machine learning tasks. Our findings offer new insight into the relationship between quantum walks and underdamped Langevin dynamics, as well as the intrinsic mechanisms underlying quantum speedup and classical gradient acceleration."}

Despite their key role in the ergodic theory approach to fluid turbulence, identifying UPOs is challenging for two reasons: chaotic dynamics and the high-dimensionality of the spatial discretization. We address both issues at once by proposing a loop convergence algorithm for UPOs directly within a low-dimensional embedding of the chaotic attractor. The convergence algorithm circumvents time-integration, hence avoiding instabilities from exponential error amplification, and operates on a latent dynamics obtained by pulling back the physical equations using automatic differentiation through the learned embedding function. The interpretable latent dynamics is accurate in a statistical sense, and, crucially, the embedding preserves the internal structure of the attractor, which we demonstrate through an equivalence between the latent and physical UPOs of both a model PDE and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. This allows us to exploit the collapse of high-dimensional dissipative systems onto a lower dimensional manifold, and identify UPOs in the low-dimensional embedding."}

In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms."}
