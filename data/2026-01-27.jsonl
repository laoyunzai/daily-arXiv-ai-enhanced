We demonstrate that any density operator $ρ_{AB}$ of a composite system can be derived from the correlations between two underlying stochastic processes, $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$, representing the random fluctuations of its subsystems. This construction utilizes a two-scale temporal scheme - micro and macro time - where quantum correlations emerge as macro-correlations derived from underlying micro-correlations. We propose the Double Covariance Model (DCM), which reproduces the fundamental properties of quantum theory by treating the quantum state as the fourth-order moment structure of an underlying classical probability space."}

Such descriptions, however, correspond to the singular physical limit of vanishing environmental memory. Here we formulate decoherence using a general time-nonlocal decoherence functional determined solely by the environmental force correlation function, with Markovian dynamics recovered explicitly as a limiting case.\n  For arbitrary stationary environments with finite temporal correlations, we show that the decoherence functional exhibits quadratic short-time growth that is model-independent within the finite-memory class considered. Consequently, the decoherence time defined operationally-without assuming exponential decay-scales as the square root of the environmental correlation time, independent of the detailed form of the bath correlation kernel.\n  These results are illustrated analytically for Gaussian-correlated, soft power-law, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck environments. In the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck case, the non-Markovian dynamics admit an exact analytical closure, yielding a closed evolution equation for the coherence. Exact numerical simulations based on a pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling and show that exponential decoherence emerges only in the memoryless limit.\n  Beyond coherence decay, we distinguish decoherence rates from observable loss of quantum signatures by analyzing purity and von Neumann entropy dynamics. We show that suppression of a specific coherence element need not coincide with irreversible entropy production. Finally, we introduce an inferred-memory perspective in which the environmental correlation time is treated as an operationally extractable parameter from dynamical data."}

In merely hyperbolic systems, it decays to zero, reflecting the absence of entropy production, while remaining well defined at finite scales. Numerical results for the Henon map and Feigenbaum point illustrate these behaviors. Our findings yield a finite scale geometric characterization of chaotic dynamics, consistent with classical entropy theory where applicable. We further demonstrate that the observable remains well defined in open intermittent systems, where trajectories escape and classical asymptotic invariants fail, revealing finite scale signatures of transient weak chaos."}

However, the relationship between models at different scales has rarely been explored. In this study, based on the original microscopic social force model with a reactive optimal route choice strategy, we first derive kinetic equations at the mesoscopic level.

We define an inferential efficiency as the ratio of information gain to cumulative memory erasure cost, with inefficiency arising from unexploited correlations between the measured system and memories, and/or between memories and environment (noise). Using this efficiency, we benchmark two limiting measurement paradigms: sequential, in which the same memory is exploited iteratively, and parallel, in which many memories are exploited simultaneously. In both cases, the minimal erasure cost reflects correlations across memories: temporal in sequential, spatial in parallel. Remarkably, when all system-memory correlations are exploited for inference, both paradigms attain the same minimal erasure cost, even in the presence of noise. Conversely, the parallel paradigm performs better in the presence of unexploited correlations, stemming from hidden memories' degrees of freedom. This approach provides a quantitative, physically grounded criterion to compare inference strategies, determine their efficiency, and link target information gains to their minimal entropic cost."}

Using classical Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this ferrichiral skyrmion phase emerges at zero temperature and in the absence of both an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, in sharp contrast to conventional skyrmion-hosting systems. The phase is stable over a wide parameter window and persists to relatively high temperatures. Our results reveal an unconventional route to skyrmion physics driven purely by frustrated exchange interactions and highlight the emergence of rich topological structures. Since both XXZ anisotropy and Kitaev interactions originate from the same spin-orbit-coupling mechanism, materials traditionally classified as XXZ magnets are expected to host finite Kitaev interactions as well. The potential for ferrichirality in these systems therefore warrants further investigation."}

Here we introduce a tensor-network approach to compute the discrete Laplace transform, a non-unitary, aperiodic transform (in contrast to the Fourier transform). We encode a length-$N$ signal on two paired $n$-qubit registers and decompose the overall map into a non-unitary exponential Damping Transform followed by a Quantum Fourier Transform, both compressed in a single matrix-product operator. This decomposition admits strong MPO compression to low bond dimension resulting in significant acceleration.

Here, using a new probabilistic data-driven framework applied to molecular simulation data on water, we identify local collective variables that discriminate low-density and high-density amorphous (LDA and HDA) ices and characterize pressure-induced transitions between these phases. As expected, descriptors related to local density capably distinguish LDA and HDA; however, phase identity is surprisingly encoded within the first coordination shell. Furthermore, LDA transitions to HDA by a simple redistribution of LDA- and HDA-like environments with no evident intermediate structures, in accordance with a first-order-like transition that contrasts with the gradual evolution observed in other amorphous systems such as metallic glasses. These findings are robust across force fields, which themselves exhibit structural differences, and exemplify how other systems lacking obvious distinguishing features can be characterized."}

Although charge fluctuations at zero temperature are generally suppressed by particle-number conservation, their long-wavelength scaling reveals distinct universal behaviors that define quantum hyperuniformity classes. By exemplifying the Aubry-Andre model, we find that gapped, gapless, and localized-critical-extended phases are sharply distinguished by the quantum hyperuniformity classes. Notably, at the critical point, multifractal wave functions generate anomalous scaling behavior. We further show that, in quantum-hyperuniform gapped phases, the quantum weight provides a quantitative measure of the gap size through a universal power-law scaling.

Their practical performance, however, is often constrained by unmodelled effects, including noise, imperfect state preparation, and non-ideal control fields.\n  In this work, we report the first experimental implementation of a graybox modelling strategy for a solid-state open quantum system. The graybox framework integrates a physics-based system model with a data-driven description of experimental imperfections, achieving higher fidelity than purely analytical (whitebox) approaches while requiring fewer training resources than fully deep-learning models. We experimentally validate the method on the task of estimating a static magnetic field using a single-spin quantum sensor, performing Bayesian inference with a graybox model trained on prior experimental data. Using roughly 10,000 training datapoints, the graybox model yields several orders of magnitude improvement in mean squared error over the corresponding physics-only model.

Out of equilibrium, the distributions of clockwise and counterclockwise cyclic first passage times are related by a detailed fluctuation theorem. This result descends from a symmetry of clockwise and counterclockwise trajectories, which combines time reversal with swapping portions of the trajectories. We then relate the entropy produced along the cycle with the entropy production of the whole system using large deviation theory. Our results reveal a novel symmetry in stochastic systems, of potential broad applicability in non-equilibrium physics."}

By decomposing a noninteracting bath Hamiltonian into a Cayley tree, the method provides a tensor network representation that naturally captures the multiscale entanglement structure intrinsic to impurity-bath systems. This geometry differs from conventional chain-based mappings and yields a substantial reduction of entanglement, allowing accurate ground-state properties and long-time dynamics to be captured at significantly lower bond dimensions. Benchmark calculations for the single-impurity Anderson model demonstrate that the TTN solver achieves markedly enhanced resolution of real-frequency spectral functions, without invoking analytic continuation. This impurity solver provides a balanced, scale-uniform description of impurity physics and offers a versatile approach for real-time dynamical mean-field theory and related applications involving quantum impurity models."}

This paper will study the ground state properties and quantum critical dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model through a combined perspective that includes exact diagonalisation, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulations, and simulations on realistic physical quantum devices. We focus on a lattice of four spins, where we calculate the ground-state energies, magnetic order parameters and correlation functions at uniformly applied conditions, which is repeated by all systems. Precise diagonalisation provides both a benchmark, which is symmetry-conserving, and a depth-two, physics inspired variational approximation, which provides simulations accessible to hardware. The circuits that have been optimised identically are then placed on the IQM Garnet quantum processor, using a resource-efficient batched protocol. We find that the ground-state energies of shallow variational circuits are reliably captured by the circuit over the entire parameter space; the magnetic arrangement parameters and observables sensitive to correlation signal significantly more noise. The error analysis of quantitative analysis reveals a strong broadening of critical crossover on hardware, which is consistent with the noise attenuation of long-range correlations. These findings highlight the current capabilities as well as the fundamental limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum systems in modelling quantum critical phenomena as a benchmark to future enhancements in obtaining quantum hardware and quantum algorithms development."}

The fundamental thermodynamic origins of this sensitivity remains elusive. Here, by decomposing the Helmholtz free energy across three representative repulsive systems, we reveal a universal competition between energy and entropy that dictates the melting pathway. The energetic contribution consistently imparts convexity to the free energy, whereas entropy imparts concavity. A first-order transition occurs when concave entropy dominates; otherwise, the transition is continuous. Further decomposition shows that vibrational entropy drives the concave total entropic curvature, while the configurational entropy's curvature switches from convex (first-order) to concave (continuous), mirroring defect proliferation measured by Shannon entropy. The convexity of the energy is dominated by the inherent potential, with minimal vibrational influence. Finally, we predict and verify that the first-order transition becomes continuous at zero temperature, where entropic effects vanish. Our work establishes the curvature of different thermodynamic quantities as a fundamental principle for understanding the nature of two-dimensional melting."}

In the separation-of-timescales regime where spin dynamics is fast, adiabatic elimination yields a reduced mechanical master equation with closed-form, detuning-dependent transition rates and a sharp threshold given by the sign change of the phonon-number damping.

We study long-wavelength fluctuations of many-body ground states through the charge-density structure factor by incorporating intrinsic quantum fluctuations into hyperuniformity. Although charge fluctuations at zero temperature are generally suppressed by particle-number conservation, their long-wavelength scaling reveals distinct universal behaviors that define quantum hyperuniformity classes. By exemplifying the Aubry-Andre model, we find that gapped, gapless, and localized-critical-extended phases are sharply distinguished by the quantum hyperuniformity classes. Notably, at the critical point, multifractal wave functions generate anomalous scaling behavior. We further show that, in quantum-hyperuniform gapped phases, the quantum weight provides a quantitative measure of the gap size through a universal power-law scaling. Along with classical hyperuniformity, quantum hyperuniformity serves a direct fingerprint of quantum criticality and a practical probe of quantum phase transitions in aperiodic electron systems."}

At a physical level, QEC codes perform parity checks on data qubits, producing syndrome information, through Syndrome Measurement (SM) circuits. These circuits define a code's logical error rate and must be run repeatedly throughout the entire program. The performance of SM circuits is therefore critical to the success of a FTQC system.\n  While ultimately implemented as physical circuits, SM circuits have challenges that are not addressed by existing circuit optimization tools. Importantly, inside SM circuits themselves errors are expected to occur, and how errors propagate through SM circuits directly impacts which errors are detectable and correctable, defining the code's logical error rate. This is not modeled in NISQ-era tools, which instead optimize for targets such as gate depth or gate count to mitigate the chance that any error occurs. This gap leaves key questions unanswered about the expected real-world effectiveness of QEC codes.\n  In this work we address this gap and present PropHunt, an automated tool for optimizing SM circuits for CSS codes. We evaluate PropHunt on a suite of relevant QEC codes and demonstrate PropHunt's ability to iteratively improve performance and recover existing hand-designed circuits automatically. We also propose a near-term QEC application, Hook-ZNE, which leverages PropHunt's fine-grained control over logical error rate to improve Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE), a promising error mitigation strategy."}

Such descriptions, however, correspond to the singular physical limit of vanishing environmental memory. Here we formulate decoherence using a general time-nonlocal decoherence functional determined solely by the environmental force correlation function, with Markovian dynamics recovered explicitly as a limiting case.\n  For arbitrary stationary environments with finite temporal correlations, we show that the decoherence functional exhibits quadratic short-time growth that is model-independent within the finite-memory class considered. Consequently, the decoherence time defined operationally-without assuming exponential decay-scales as the square root of the environmental correlation time, independent of the detailed form of the bath correlation kernel.\n  These results are illustrated analytically for Gaussian-correlated, soft power-law, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck environments. In the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck case, the non-Markovian dynamics admit an exact analytical closure, yielding a closed evolution equation for the coherence. Exact numerical simulations based on a pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling and show that exponential decoherence emerges only in the memoryless limit.\n  Beyond coherence decay, we distinguish decoherence rates from observable loss of quantum signatures by analyzing purity and von Neumann entropy dynamics. We show that suppression of a specific coherence element need not coincide with irreversible entropy production. Finally, we introduce an inferred-memory perspective in which the environmental correlation time is treated as an operationally extractable parameter from dynamical data."}

Primary examples include the recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2) and multilayer graphene aligned with hBN, where TRS is broken in partially filled flat moire Chern bands. Among the FCIs in tMoTe2, the most robust is at a hole filling of v = -2/3 per moire unit cell. Interestingly, transient optical sensing and more recent transport measurements revealed a correlated state at v = -4/3, twice the filling factor for the v = -2/3 FCI. Here, employing pump-probe circular dichroism (CD) measurements on tMoTe2 with twist angles = 3.9 degree and 3.7 degree, we find that the v = -4/3 state exhibits vanishing magnetization (m = 0) in finite windows of out-of-plane magnetic field less than ~2-4 mT, and a first order phase transition to + - m states at higher fields. This out-of-plane antiferromagnetic (AFM) like behavior is notably absent for all other correlated states and disappears for the v = -4/3 state at higher or lower twist angles = 4.0 degree and 3.3 degree. The observed magnetic signature at v = -4/3 is consistent with a predicted fractional topological insulator (FTI) with TRS, consisting of two copies of -2/3 FCIs with opposite chiralities. We support these findings with calculations in the interacting continuum model of tMoTe2. Our work presents a candidate for fractional topological insulators with TRS."}

While well-established for static magnetic fluxes, the effect's behavior under time-varying fluxes remains an open and debated question. Employing the WKB method, we derive the AB phase shift for a time-dependent magnetic vector potential, demonstrating that for circular paths in the quasistatic regime, it is proportional to the time-averaged enclosed magnetic flux, \\(Δφ_{\\rm AB} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T e Φ(t) \\, dt\\), with the total phase shift, including kinetic contributions, equaling \\(e Φ(0)\\). For non-circular paths, the phase shift depends on both the flux history and path geometry, revealing the effect's hybrid nature involving gauge potentials and induced electric fields. We verify the consistency of our gauge choice with Maxwell's equations and discuss the implications for local versus nonlocal interpretations of the AB effect. We also generalize the results to scenarios with nonzero external magnetic fields, where the enclosed flux is through the actual electron paths, and for circular paths of radius $R$, the AB phase shift is also proportional to the time average of the enclosed flux \\(Φ_{\\rm enc}(R,t)\\), with the total phase shift depending only on the initial enclosed flux \\(e Φ_{\\rm enc}(R,0)\\); for general non-circular paths, the external magnetic field affects trajectories and phase accumulation through the Lorentz force, leading to additional path dependence.

Our central finding is disorder-induced dimension reduction accompanied by spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry: order emerges from the combination of two sources of randomness (thermal noise and quenched disorder), with the manifold topology determining the character of the emerging structures.

We confirm quantum coherence by demonstrating three-photon Rabi oscillations and performing direct Wigner function measurements that reveal three-component cat-like states. We observe breathing-like dynamics in phase space, arising from exotic temporal interference between the qutrit and excited states.

The algorithm runs in polynomial time and achieves an exponential speedup over both transverse-field quantum annealing and state-of-the-art classical solvers on these instances, under assumptions supported by analytical and numerical evidence. We identify the essential quantum mechanism enabling the speedup as the use of a non-stoquastic XX-driver to access a larger sign-structured admissible subspace beyond the stoquastic regime, which allows sign-generating quantum interference to create smooth evolution paths that bypass tunneling. This identifies a distinctive quantum mechanism underlying the speedup and explains why no efficient classical analogue is likely to exist. In addition, our analysis produces scalable small-scale models, derived from our structural reduction, that capture the essential dynamics of the algorithm. These models provide a concrete opportunity for verification of the quantum advantage mechanism on currently available universal quantum computers."}

This decomposition admits strong MPO compression to low bond dimension resulting in significant acceleration.

In this work, we present a systematic framework with a simple preprocessing procedure for constraint-aware initialization in Grover's algorithm, focusing on problems with linear constraints. While such structured initial states can reduce the number of oracle queries required to obtain a solution, their preparation incurs additional circuit-level costs. We therefore offer a conservative circuit-level resource analysis, showing that the resulting constraint-aware initialization can improve resource efficiency in terms of gate counts and circuit depth. The validity of the framework is further demonstrated numerically using the exact-cover problem. Overall, our results indicate that this approach serves as a practical baseline for achieving more resource-efficient implementations of Grover's algorithm compared to the standard uniform initialization."}

Here we demonstrate that the KD quasiprobability provides a general framework for all measurement regimes by identifying pointer-induced decoherence as the universal mechanism controlling this transition. We show that the decoherence factor F(t) simultaneously quantifies the loss of quantum coherence and interpolates the measurement strength from weak to strong. Within this framework, the KD quasiprobability naturally deforms from its full complex form-governing weak values-to the real, non-negative Wigner formula describing projective measurements, while maintaining informational completeness throughout the transition. Our work resolves the fundamental question of the KD distribution's applicability by establishing it as the universal framework that seamlessly connects all quantum measurement regimes through a physically transparent decoherence pathway."}

We prove that this new quantity satisfies a data processing inequality which can be interpreted as the increment in the economic-theoretic value provided by side information; crucially, such a data processing inequality is a consequence of the agent's economic-theoretically consistent risk-averse attitude towards every lottery and vice versa. Finally, we apply these results to the resource theory of informative measurements in general probabilistic theories (GPTs).

However, practical implementations face severe degradation of both metrics due to unavoidable losses, representing the foremost challenge in advancing quantum interferometry toward real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent-amplifier-empowered quantum interferometer. The coherent amplifier dramatically suppresses the decay of both sensitivity and quantum enhancement under high-loss conditions, maintaining phase sensitivity beyond the original SQL even for losses exceeding 90%. Using an injected 4.2 dB squeezed-vacuum state in experimental demonstration, our scheme reduces the quantum enhancement degradation under 90% loss from 3.7 dB in a conventional quantum interferometer (CQI) to only 1.5 dB. More importantly, the phase sensitivity degradation under the same loss is limited to 4.0 dB, markedly outperforming the 11.2 dB degradation observed in a CQI. This improvement is enabled by the coherent amplifier's phase-sensitive photon amplification and its protection of the quantum state. This breakthrough in amplifier-empowered quantum interferometry overcomes the critical barrier to practical deployment, enabling robust quantum-enhanced measurements in lossy environments."}

Motivated by the need to increase the temporal granularity of originally monthly data to enable more effective training of AI models for epidemiological forecasting, the dataset harmonizes municipal-level dengue hospitalization time series across Brazil and disaggregates them to weekly resolution (epidemiological weeks) through an interpolation protocol with a correction step that preserves monthly totals. The statistical and temporal validity of this disaggregation was assessed using a high-resolution reference dataset from the state of Sao Paulo (2024), which simultaneously provides monthly and epidemiological-week counts, enabling a direct comparison of three strategies: linear interpolation, jittering, and cubic spline. Results indicated that cubic spline interpolation achieved the highest adherence to the reference data, and this strategy was therefore adopted to generate weekly series for the 1999 to 2021 period. In addition to hospitalization time series, the dataset includes a comprehensive set of explanatory variables commonly used in epidemiological and environmental modeling, such as demographic density, CH4, CO2, and NO2 emissions, poverty and urbanization indices, maximum temperature, mean monthly precipitation, minimum relative humidity, and municipal latitude and longitude, following the same temporal disaggregation scheme to ensure multivariate compatibility. The paper documents the datasets provenance, structure, formats, licenses, limitations, and quality metrics (MAE, RMSE, R2, KL, JSD, DTW, and the KS test), and provides usage recommendations for multivariate time-series analysis, environmental health studies, and the development of machine learning and deep learning models for outbreak forecasting."}

These systems differ fundamentally from traditional machine learning models, both in architecture and deployment, introducing unique AI safety challenges, including goal misalignment, compounding decision errors, and coordination risks among interacting agents, that necessitate embedding interpretability and explainability by design to ensure traceability and accountability across their autonomous behaviors. Current interpretability techniques, developed primarily for static models, show limitations when applied to agentic systems. The temporal dynamics, compounding decisions, and context-dependent behaviors of agentic systems demand new analytical approaches. This paper assesses the suitability and limitations of existing interpretability methods in the context of agentic systems, identifying gaps in their capacity to provide meaningful insight into agent decision-making. We propose future directions for developing interpretability techniques specifically designed for agentic systems, pinpointing where interpretability is required to embed oversight mechanisms across the agent lifecycle from goal formation, through environmental interaction, to outcome evaluation. These advances are essential to ensure the safe and accountable deployment of agentic AI systems."}

We show that any EHL crossing a factorized partition must vanish, and that the EHLs between any set of blocks can be expressed as a sum of all the EHLs that join all of them. This last result allows us to provide an exact representation of the EE of any block of a pure state, from the sum of the EHLs which cross its boundary. In order to illustrate their rich structure, we discuss some explicit numerical examples using ground states of local Hamiltonians.

However, existing data synthesis methods often suffer from limited diversity and lack precise control over problem difficulty, making them insufficient for supporting efficient training paradigms such as curriculum learning. To address these challenges, we propose MathMixup, a novel data synthesis paradigm that systematically generates high-quality, difficulty-controllable mathematical reasoning problems through hybrid and decomposed strategies. Automated self-checking and manual screening are incorporated to ensure semantic clarity and a well-structured difficulty gradient in the synthesized data. Building on this, we construct the MathMixupQA dataset and design a curriculum learning strategy that leverages these graded problems, supporting flexible integration with other datasets. Experimental results show that MathMixup and its curriculum learning strategy significantly enhance the mathematical reasoning performance of LLMs. Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B achieves an average score of 52.6\\% across seven mathematical benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods.

Symbolic systems offer reliability and interpretability but lack scalability, while neural networks provide learning capabilities but sacrifice transparency. Tensor Logic, proposed by Domingos, suggests that logical rules and Einstein summation are mathematically equivalent, offering a principled path toward unification. This paper provides empirical validation of this framework through three experiments. First, we demonstrate the equivalence between recursive Datalog rules and iterative tensor contractions by computing the transitive closure of a biblical genealogy graph containing 1,972 individuals and 1,727 parent-child relationships, converging in 74 iterations to discover 33,945 ancestor relationships. Second, we implement reasoning in embedding space by training a neural network with learnable transformation matrices, demonstrating successful zero-shot compositional inference on held-out queries.

Using Domingos's relation matrix formulation $R_r = E^\\top A_r E$, we achieve MRR of 0.3068 on standard link prediction and MRR of 0.3346 on a compositional reasoning benchmark where direct edges are removed during training, demonstrating that matrix composition enables multi-hop inference without direct training examples."}

Early diagnosis is essential to mitigate the progressive deterioration of patients' quality of life.

Although the analysis of such recordings is costly from a clinical point of view, advances in machine learning techniques are making the processing of this type of data increasingly accurate and efficient. Vocal recordings contain many features, but it is not known whether all of them are relevant for diagnosing the disease.\n  This paper proposes the use of different types of machine learning models combined with feature selection methods to detect the disease. The selection techniques allow to reduce the number of features used by the classifiers by determining which ones provide the most information about the problem. The results show that machine learning methods, in particular neural networks, are suitable for PD classification and that the number of features can be significantly reduced without affecting the performance of the models."}

Despite strong in-sample performance, these models often degrade when confronted with evolving real-world market regimes, which can shift dramatically due to macroeconomic changes-e.g., monetary policy updates or unanticipated fluctuations in participant behavior. We identify two challenges that perpetuate this mismatch: (1) insufficient robustness in existing policy against uncertainties in high-level market fluctuations, and (2) the absence of a realistic and diverse simulation environment for training, leading to policy overfitting. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian Robust Framework that systematically integrates a macro-conditioned generative model with robust policy learning. On the data side, to generate realistic and diverse data, we propose a macro-conditioned GAN-based generator that leverages macroeconomic indicators as primary control variables, synthesizing data with faithful temporal, cross-instrument, and macro correlations. On the policy side, to learn robust policy against market fluctuations, we cast the trading process as a two-player zero-sum Bayesian Markov game, wherein an adversarial agent simulates shifting regimes by perturbing macroeconomic indicators in the macro-conditioned generator, while the trading agent-guided by a quantile belief network-maintains and updates its belief over hidden market states. The trading agent seeks a Robust Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium via Bayesian neural fictitious self-play, stabilizing learning under adversarial market perturbations. Extensive experiments on 9 financial instruments demonstrate that our framework outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines. In extreme events like the COVID, our method shows improved profitability and risk management, offering a reliable solution for trading under uncertain and shifting market dynamics."}

We develop a minimal and calibratable theory that predicts these regimes from three binding constraints of modern agent stacks: finite context windows, lossy inter-agent communication, and shared failures among similar agents. Each leaf agent is summarized by a compute-performance scaling exponent $β$; communication is captured by a message-length fidelity curve $γ(m)$; dependence is captured by an effective shared-error correlation $ρ$; and a context window $W$ imposes hard fan-in limits that make hierarchy necessary. For binary success/failure tasks with majority aggregation, we prove a sharp phase transition for deep $b$-ary trees with correlated inputs and lossy communication: a single scalar $α_ρ$ (combining $γ(m)$, $ρ$, and fan-in $b$) determines whether weak signal is amplified to a nontrivial fixed point or washed out to chance. In the amplifying regime, we derive an organization exponent $s$ and show that budgeted synergy, i.e., outperforming the best single agent under the same total budget, occurs exactly when $s>β$, yielding closed-form compute allocation rules and explicit budget thresholds. We further characterize saturation via a mixing depth and provide a conservative clipped predictor that remains accurate across growth and saturation. A continuous-performance warm-up gives closed-form risks for star, chain, and tree organizations, making correlation- and communication-induced floors explicit and exposing the core design trade-offs in a smooth setting. Finally, we validate the predicted phase boundaries in controlled synthetic simulations and show how the same mechanisms explain the dominant bottlenecks reported in recent large-scale matched-budget studies of LLM agent-system scaling."}

This approach implicitly assumes uniform contribution across all embedding coordinates and overlooks the possibility that optimal structural information may be concentrated in specific regions of the embedding space. This study reframes embeddings as searchable landscapes and adapts Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis (DynEGA) to systematically traverse embedding coordinates, treating the dimension index as a pseudo-temporal ordering analogous to intensive longitudinal trajectories. A large-scale Monte Carlo simulation embedded items representing five dimensions of grandiose narcissism using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model, generating network estimations across systematically varied item pool sizes (3-40 items per dimension) and embedding depths (3-1,298 dimensions). Results reveal that Total Entropy Fit Index (TEFI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) leads to competing optimization trajectories across the embedding landscape. TEFI achieves minima at deep embedding ranges (900--1,200 dimensions) where entropy-based organization is maximal but structural accuracy degrades, whereas NMI peaks at shallow depths where dimensional recovery is strongest but entropy-based fit remains suboptimal. Single-metric optimization produces structurally incoherent solutions, whereas a weighted composite criterion identifies embedding dimensions depth regions that jointly balance accuracy and organization. Optimal embedding depth scales systematically with item pool size. These findings establish embedding landscapes as non-uniform semantic spaces requiring principled optimization rather than default full-vector usage."}

Typical QKD security proofs are carried out in an idealized setting where authentication is assumed to behave honestly: it never aborts, and all classical messages are delivered faithfully with their original timing preserved. Authenticated channels that can be constructed in practice have different properties. Most critically, such channels may abort asymmetrically, such that only the receiving party may detect an authentication failure while the sending party remains unaware. Furthermore, an adversary may delay, reorder, or block classical messages. This discrepancy renders the standard QKD security definition and existing QKD security proofs invalid in the practical authentication setting. In this work we resolve this issue. Our main result is a reduction theorem showing that, under mild and easily satisfied protocol conditions, any QKD protocol proven secure under the honest authentication setting remains secure under a practical authentication setting.

Although these models are extremely large, their sparse activation enables inference to be performed by accessing only a fraction of the model at a time. This property opens the possibility of on-device inference of MoE, which was previously considered infeasible for such large models. Consequently, various systems have been proposed to leverage this sparsity and enable efficient MoE inference for edge devices. However, previous MoE inference systems like Fiddler[8] or DAOP[13] rely on DRAM-based offloading and are not suitable for memory constrained on-device environments. As recent MoE models grow to hundreds of gigabytes, RAM-offloading solutions become impractical. To address this, we propose FlashMoE, a system that offloads inactive experts to SSD, enabling efficient MoE inference under limited RAM. FlashMoE incorporates a lightweight ML-based caching strategy that adaptively combines recency and frequency signals to maximize expert reuse, significantly reducing storage I/O. In addition, we built a user-grade desktop platform to demonstrate the practicality of FlashMoE. On this real hardware setup, FlashMoE improves cache hit rate by up to 51% over well-known offloading policies such as LRU and LFU, and achieves up to 2.6x speedup compared to existing MoE inference systems."}

Under this framework, we derive four classes of results. First, we show that generality is inherently relational: there is no distribution-independent notion of AGI. Second, we prove non-invariance results demonstrating that arbitrarily small perturbations of the task distribution can invalidate AGI properties via cliff sets, precluding universal robustness. Third, we establish bounded transfer guarantees, ruling out unbounded generalization across task families under finite resources. Fourth, invoking Rice-style and Gödel--Tarski arguments, we prove that AGI is a nontrivial semantic property and therefore cannot be soundly and completely certified by any computable procedure, including procedures implemented by the agent itself. Consequently, recursive self-improvement schemes that rely on internal self-certification of AGI are ill-posed. Taken together, our results show that strong, distribution-independent claims of AGI are not false but undefined without explicit formal indexing, and that empirical progress in AI does not imply the attainability of self-certifying general intelligence."}

Random Hamiltonians drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble generate stochastic unitary dynamics of the quantum state, while equivalence classes reflecting finite detector resolution define classical observables as well as classical configuration-space and phase-space submanifolds. When the evolution is constrained to the phase-space submanifold, free Schrödinger dynamics reduces to Newtonian motion, while stochastic motion constrained to the classical configuration-space submanifold yields ordinary Brownian motion in classical space. Transition probabilities under the stochastic dynamics satisfy the Born rule, whereas the constrained classical evolution produces the normal probability distributions characteristic of classical measurements. We show that, in this setting, measurement, state reduction, and the quantum-classical transition emerge from unitary dynamics alone, without invoking nonunitary collapse or additional postulates. Entanglement and EPR correlations arise geometrically from the evolution of joint states in composite state space, preserving locality in spacetime. The framework provides a unified dynamical account of measurement and classicality compatible with the structure of quantum mechanics."}

However, we find that existing specificity evaluation protocols are inadequate for this purpose. We systematically elaborated on the three fundamental issues it faces. Beyond the conceptual issues, we further empirically demonstrate that existing specificity metrics are weakly correlated with the strength of specificity regularizers. We also find that current metrics lack sufficient sensitivity, rendering them ineffective at distinguishing the specificity performance of different methods. Finally, we propose a constructive evaluation protocol. Under this protocol, the conflict between open-ended LLMs and the assumption of determined answers is eliminated, query-independent fluency biases are avoided, and the evaluation strictness can be smoothly adjusted within a near-continuous space. Experiments across various LLMs, datasets, and editing methods show that metrics derived from the proposed protocol are more sensitive to changes in the strength of specificity regularizers and exhibit strong correlation with them, enabling more fine-grained discrimination of different methods' knowledge preservation capabilities."}

The decomposition is based on a smooth periodic extension of the identity map via the Fourier extension method, resulting in a sine series with exponentially decaying coefficients. Rewriting the sine series in terms of complex exponentials, then evaluating it on the Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts of a non-unitary operator, yields its approximation by a linear combination of unitaries. When implemented in a quantum circuit, the subnormalisation of the resulting block encoding scales with the double logarithm of the inverse error, substantially improving over the polynomial relationship in existing methods. For hardware or applications with a fixed error budget, we discuss a strategy to minimise subnormalisation by exploiting the overcomplete nature of the Fourier extension basis. This regularisation procedure traces an error-subnormalisation Pareto front, identifying coefficients that maximise the subnormalisation at a fixed error budget. Fourier linear combinations of unitaries thus provides an accurate and versatile framework for non-unitary quantum computing."}

Moreover, in practical scenarios such as adding/dropping teammates or facing environment dynamics that differ from the training, CTDE methods can be brittle and costly to retrain, whereas distributed approaches allow agents to adapt using only local information and peer-to-peer communication. We present a distributed MARL framework that removes the need for centralized critics or global information. Firstly, we develop a novel Distributed Graph Attention Network (D-GAT) that performs global state inference through multi-hop communication, where agents integrate neighbor features via input-dependent attention weights in a fully distributed manner. Leveraging D-GAT, we develop the distributed graph-attention MAPPO (DG-MAPPO) -- a distributed MARL framework where agents optimize local policies and value functions using local observations, multi-hop communication, and shared/averaged rewards. Empirical evaluation on the StarCraftII Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, and Multi-Agent Mujoco demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines, achieving superior coordination across a wide range of cooperative tasks with both homogeneous and heterogeneous teams. Our distributed MARL framework provides a principled and scalable solution for robust collaboration, eliminating the need for centralized training or global observability. To the best of our knowledge, DG-MAPPO appears to be the first to fully eliminate reliance on privileged centralized information, enabling agents to learn and act solely through peer-to-peer communication."}

To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Learning Path Planning (MALPP) framework that leverages a role- and rule-based collaboration mechanism among intelligent agents, each powered by LLMs. The framework includes three task-specific agents: a learner analytics agent, a path planning agent, and a reflection agent. These agents collaborate via structured prompts and predefined rules to analyze learning profiles, generate tailored learning paths, and iteratively refine them with interpretable feedback. Grounded in Cognitive Load Theory and Zone of Proximal Development, the system ensures that recommended paths are cognitively aligned and pedagogically meaningful. Experiments conducted on the MOOCCubeX dataset using seven LLMs show that MALPP significantly outperforms baseline models in path quality, knowledge sequence consistency, and cognitive load alignment. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the collaborative mechanism and theoretical constraints.

We find that introducing disability context consistently degrades interpretive fidelity, inducing interpretation shifts characterised by speculative inference, narrative elaboration, affective degradation and deficit oriented framing.

It is a blend of quantum and classical methods for tackling tough problems in machine learning, chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. Yet as these algorithms scale up, they cannot escape the barren-plateau phenomenon. As systems grow, gradients can vanish so quickly that training deep or randomly initialized circuits becomes nearly impossible. To overcome the barren plateau problem, we introduce a two-stage optimization framework. First comes the convex initialization stage. Here, we shape the quantum energy landscape, the Hilmaton landscape, into a smooth, low-energy basin. This step makes gradients easier to spot and keeps noise from derailing the process. Once we have gotten a stable gradient flow, we move to the second stage: nonconvex refinement. In this phase, we allow the algorithm to explore different energy minima, thereby making the model more expressive. Finally, we used our two-stage solution to perform quantum cryptanalysis of the quantum key distribution protocol (i.e., BB84) to determine the optimal cloning strategies. The simulation results showed that our proposed two-stage solution outperforms its random initialization counterpart."}

To address this issue, we propose a method to construct a significantly sparser logical QUBO model for these constraints. By adding auxiliary variables based on specific network structures, our approach decomposes the original constraint into smaller, more manageable constraints. We demonstrate that this method reduces the number of edges (quadratic terms) from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ for the one-hot constraint and to $O(N\\log N)$ in the worst case for general equality constraints, where $N$ is the number of variables. Experimental results on D-Wave's hardware show that our formulation leads to substantial reductions in the number of qubits required for embedding, shorter average chain lengths, lower chain break rates, and higher feasible solution rates compared to conventional methods.

Analyzing a range of CNNs, Vision Transformers, and Vision-Language Models using both in-distribution (ImageNetV2) and out-of-distribution (CIFAR-10) testbeds, our initial findings suggest that: (1) architectural family is a primary determinant of representational similarity, forming distinct clusters; (2) CKA self-similarity and task accuracy are strongly correlated during pruning, though accuracy often degrades more sharply; and (3) for some model pairs, pruning appears to regularize representations, exposing a shared computational core.

QRU leverages quantum controlled-SWAP (C-SWAP; Fredkin) gates to implement an information selection mechanism inspired by classical Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), enabling selective processing of temporal information via quantum operations. Through its innovative recurrent architecture featuring measurement results feedforward state propagation and shared parameters across time steps, QRU achieves constant circuit depth and constant parameter count regardless of input sequence length, effectively circumventing stringent NISQ hardware constraints. We systematically validate QRU through three progressive experiments: (1) oscillatory behavior prediction, where 72-parameter QRU matches 197-parameter classical GRU performance; (2) Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer classification, where 35 parameters achieve 96.13% accuracy comparable to 167-parameter artificial NNs; and (3) MNIST handwritten digit recognition, where 132 parameters reach 98.05% accuracy, outperforming a 27,265-parameter convolutional NN. These results demonstrate that QRU consistently achieves comparable or superior performance with significantly fewer parameters than classical NNs while maintaining constant quantum circuit depth. The architecture's quantum-native design, combining C-SWAP-based information selection with novel recurrent processing, suggests QRU's potential as a fundamental building block for next-generation ML systems, offering a promising pathway toward more efficient and scalable quantum ML architectures."}

We propose an architectural principle, the mouth is not the brain, that explicitly separates world models from language models. Our architecture comprises three components: a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) that captures domain structure as an energy-based world model, an adapter that projects latent belief states into embedding space, and a frozen GPT-2 that provides linguistic competence without domain knowledge. We instantiate this framework in the consumer review domain using Amazon smartphone reviews. Experiments demonstrate that (1) conditioning through the world model yields significantly higher sentiment correlation, lower perplexity, and greater semantic similarity compared to prompt-based generation alone; (2) the DBM's energy function distinguishes coherent from incoherent market configurations, assigning higher energy to implausible brand-price combinations; and (3) interventions on specific attributes propagate causally to generated text with intervened outputs exhibiting distributions statistically consistent with naturally occurring samples sharing the target configuration. These findings suggest that even small-scale language models can achieve consistent, controllable generation when connected to an appropriate world model, providing empirical support for separating linguistic competence from world understanding."}

The weak measurement is induced by a Ramsey interferometry measurement (RIM) on the qubit and periodically applied during the free evolution of the environment. We prove that the measurement correlation of such repetitive RIMs approximately corresponds to a direct sampling of the noise correlation function, thus enabling direct noise spectroscopy of the environment. Compared to dynamical-decoupling-based noise spectroscopy, this method can efficiently measure the full noise spectrum with the detected frequency range not limited by qubit coherence time. This method is also more resource-efficient than the correlation spectroscopy, as for the same detection accuracy with $N$ sampling times, it takes total detection time $O(N)$ while the latter one takes time $O(N^2)$.

We introduce \\textbf{Health-ORSC-Bench}, the first large-scale benchmark designed to systematically measure \\textbf{Over-Refusal} and \\textbf{Safe Completion} quality in healthcare. Comprising 31,920 benign boundary prompts across seven health categories (e.g., self-harm, medical misinformation), our framework uses an automated pipeline with human validation to test models at varying levels of intent ambiguity.

Nevertheless, the implementation of QET is severely impeded by the fundamental locality of gapped many-body systems, where the exponential clustering of ground-state correlations restricts energy extraction to microscopic scales. In this work, we address this scalability crisis within the framework of the one-dimensional anisotropic XY model. We initially provide a rigorous characterization of a monolithic measurement-induced strategy, demonstrating that while bulk projective measurements can theoretically induce long-range couplings, the approach is rendered physically untenable by exponentially diverging thermodynamic costs and vanishing success probabilities. To circumvent this impasse, we propose and analyze a hierarchical quantum repeater architecture adapted for energy teleportation. By orchestrating heralded entanglement generation, iterative entanglement purification, and nested entanglement swapping, our protocol effectively counteracts the fidelity degradation inherent in noisy quantum channels. We establish that this architecture fundamentally alters the operational resource scaling from exponential to polynomial. This proves, for the first time, the physical permissibility and computational tractability of activating vacuum energy at arbitrary distances. The significance lies not in net energy gain, but in establishing long-range QET as a viable protocol for remote quantum control and resource distribution."}

Despite this, we observe that even well-trained MoE models exhibit significantly imbalanced routing. This behavior is arguably natural-and even desirable - as imbalanced routing allows models to concentrate domain-specific knowledge within a subset of experts. Expert parallelism (EP) is designed to scale MoE models by distributing experts across multiple devices, but with a less-discussed assumption of balanced routing. Under extreme imbalance, EP can funnel a disproportionate number of tokens to a small number of experts, leading to compute- and memory-bound failures on overloaded devices during post-training or inference, where explicit load balancing is often inapplicable. We propose Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism (LLEP), a novel EP algorithm that dynamically reroutes excess tokens and associated expert parameters from overloaded devices to underutilized ones. This ensures that all devices complete their workloads within the minimum collective latency while respecting memory constraints. Across different model scales, LLEP achieves up to 5x speedup and 4x reduction in peak memory usage compared to standard EP. This enables faster and higher-throughput post-training and inference, with ~1.9x faster for gpt-oss-120b. We support our method with extensive theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations, including ablation studies. These results illuminate key trade-offs and enable a principled framework for hardware-specific hyper-parameter tuning to achieve optimal performance."}

Unlike differentiable mechanism design, which optimizes mechanisms forward, we infer mechanisms from behavior in an observational setting. We propose DIML, a likelihood-based framework that differentiates through a model of multi-agent learning dynamics and uses the candidate mechanism to generate counterfactual payoffs needed to predict observed actions. We establish identifiability of payoff differences under a conditional logit response model and prove statistical consistency of maximum likelihood estimation under standard regularity conditions. We evaluate DIML with simulated interactions of learning agents across unstructured neural mechanisms, congestion tolling, public goods subsidies, and large-scale anonymous games. DIML reliably recovers identifiable incentive differences and supports counterfactual prediction, where its performance rivals tabular enumeration oracle in small environments and its convergence scales to large, hundred-participant environments.

Here, we analyze, predict and compare essential scaling laws for a constructive interference of multiplexed nonclassical Gaussian states carrying information by displacement with weakly fluctuating squeezing in different multimode interference architectures. The signal-to-noise ratio quantifies the increase in displacement relative to the noise. We introduce the gain-to-instability ratio to numerically estimate the effect of unexplored resource instabilities in a large scale interference scheme. The use of the gain-to-instability ratio to quantify the scaling laws opens steps for extensive theoretical investigation of other bosonic resources and follow-up feasible experimental verification necessary for further development of these platforms."}

To address this limitation, we introduce SQL-Trail, a multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) agentic framework for Text-to-SQL. Rather than producing a query in one shot, SQL-Trail interacts with the database environment and uses execution feedback to iteratively refine its predictions. Our approach centers on two key ideas: (i) an adaptive turn-budget allocation mechanism that scales the agent's interaction depth to match question difficulty, and (ii) a composite reward panel that jointly incentivizes SQL correctness and efficient exploration. Across benchmarks, SQL-Trail sets a new state of the art and delivers strong data efficiency--up to 18x higher than prior single-pass RL state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our 7B and 14B models outperform substantially larger proprietary systems by 5% on average, underscoring the effectiveness of interactive, agentic workflows for robust Text-to-SQL generation."}

In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that autonomously optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the \"goodput,\" the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocol families (e.g., BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results demonstrate that our approach eliminates the \"fidelity cliffs\" inherent in static protocols and prevents resource wastage in high-noise regimes. Furthermore, we extend the controller to heterogeneous scenarios, demonstrating robustness for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous variable systems using effective noiseless linear amplification models. We benchmark its computational overhead, confirming real-time feasibility with decision latencies in the millisecond range per link."}

However, their use in sensitive applications has raised concerns about the potential leakage of training data. Research on privacy leakage in GNNs has largely been shaped by findings from non-graph domains, such as images and tabular data. We emphasize the need of graph specific analysis and investigate the impact of graph structure on node level membership inference. We formalize MI over node-neighbourhood tuples and investigate two important dimensions: (i) training graph construction and (ii) inference-time edge access. Empirically, snowball's coverage bias often harms generalisation relative to random sampling, while enabling inter-train-test edges at inference improves test accuracy, shrinks the train-test gap, and yields the lowest membership advantage across most of the models and datasets. We further show that the generalisation gap empirically measured as the performance difference between the train and test nodes is an incomplete proxy for MI risk: access to edges dominates-MI can rise or fall independent of gap changes. Finally, we examine the auditability of differentially private GNNs, adapting the definition of statistical exchangeability of train-test data points for graph based models. We show that for node level tasks the inductive splits (random or snowball sampled) break exchangeability, limiting the applicability of standard bounds for membership advantage of differential private models."}

This approach shifts the focus from extrinsic evaluation, which relies on downstream task performance, to the inherent properties of the data itself. Using this evaluation system, we analyze the experimental evaluations of representative generation methods for each modality and identify substantial deficiencies in current evaluation practices. Based on these findings, we offer concrete recommendations for the community to improve the evaluation of data generation.

While Federated Learning (FL) provides a framework for collaboration without raw data exchange, its classic centralized form introduces a single point of failure and remains vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Decentralized FL (DFL) mitigates this risk by removing the central aggregator but typically relies on inefficient, random peer-to-peer (P2P) pairings, forming a collaboration graph that is blind to agent heterogeneity and risks negative transfer. This paper introduces KNEXA-FL, a novel framework for orchestrated decentralization that resolves this trade-off. KNEXA-FL employs a non-aggregating Central Profiler/Matchmaker (CPM) that formulates P2P collaboration as a contextual bandit problem, using a LinUCB algorithm on abstract agent profiles to learn an optimal matchmaking policy. It orchestrates direct knowledge exchange between heterogeneous, PEFT-based LLM agents via secure distillation, without ever accessing the models themselves. Our comprehensive experiments on a challenging code generation task show that KNEXA-FL yields substantial gains, improving Pass@1 by approx. 50% relative to random P2P collaboration. Critically, our orchestrated approach demonstrates stable convergence, in stark contrast to a powerful centralized distillation baseline which suffers from catastrophic performance collapse. Our work establishes adaptive, learning-based orchestration as a foundational principle for building robust and effective decentralized AI ecosystems."}

Here, we report a new protocol that records the photocurrent via heterodyne mixing with a stable local oscillator. The obtained complex quadrature amplitude that carries information imprinted on its phase by an external magnetic field, is successfully recovered from the interference patterns between the light and the atomic spin wave, without the stringent requirement of having them overlap in time.

We integrate concepts using a modified transformer architecture in which the final encoder layer implements concept-aware cross-attention, supervised to align with human annotations. Through experiments on two robotic manipulation tasks with logical constraints, we demonstrate that ConceptACT converges faster and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard ACT.

Applying this framework to memory experiments using PEC, we analytically prove and numerically verify that the leading-order contribution to the logical error can be removed, increasing the effective code distance by 2. Our simulations on repetition and rotated surface codes show that a distance-3 code with physical-level PEC achieves logical error rates lower than or similar to a distance-5 unmitigated code while using 40% and 64% fewer qubits, respectively. These results establish physical-level QEM as a widely compatible and resource-efficient strategy for enhancing logical performance in early fault-tolerant architectures."}

Through an analysis of numerical uncertainty of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we observe that many operations are applied to values dominated by numerical noise and have negligible influence on model outputs. In some models, up to two-thirds of convolution operations appear redundant. We introduce Conservative & Aggressive NaNs, two novel variants of max pooling and unpooling that identify numerically unstable voxels and replace them with NaNs, allowing subsequent layers to skip computations on irrelevant data. Both methods are implemented within PyTorch and require no architectural changes. We evaluate these approaches on four CNN models spanning neuroimaging and image classification tasks. For inputs containing at least 50% NaNs, we observe consistent runtime improvements; for data with more than two-thirds NaNs )common in several neuroimaging settings) we achieve an average inference speedup of 1.67x. Conservative NaNs reduces convolution operations by an average of 30% across models and datasets, with no measurable performance degradation, and can skip up to 64.64% of convolutions in specific layers. Aggressive NaNs can skip up to 69.30% of convolutions but may occasionally affect performance. Overall, these methods demonstrate that numerical uncertainty can be exploited to reduce redundant computation and improve inference efficiency in CNNs."}

Yet most agent stacks provide no mandatory execution checkpoint where organizations can deterministically permit, deny, or defer an action before it changes reality. This paper introduces Faramesh, a protocol-agnostic execution control plane that enforces execution-time authorization for agent-driven actions via a non-bypassable Action Authorization Boundary (AAB). Faramesh canonicalizes agent intent into a Canonical Action Representation (CAR), evaluates actions deterministically against policy and state, and issues a decision artifact (PERMIT/DEFER/DENY) that executors must validate prior to execution. The system is designed to be framework- and model-agnostic, supports multi-agent and multi-tenant deployments, and remains independent of transport protocols (e.g., MCP). Faramesh further provides decision-centric, append-only provenance logging keyed by canonical action hashes, enabling auditability, verification, and deterministic replay without re-running agent reasoning. We show how these primitives yield enforceable, predictable governance for autonomous execution while avoiding hidden coupling to orchestration layers or observability-only approaches."}

Federated Learning offers a way out to this problem by facilitating collaborative model training without having the raw patient data centralized. However, clinical datasets intrinsically have non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) features brought about by demographic disparity and diversity in disease prevalence and institutional practices. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation research of Federated Proximal Optimization (FedProx) for Heart Disease prediction based on UCI Heart Disease dataset. We generate realistic non-IID data partitions by simulating four heterogeneous hospital clients from the Cleveland Clinic dataset (303 patients), by inducing statistical heterogeneity by demographic-based stratification. Our experimental results show that FedProx with proximal parameter mu=0.05 achieves 85.00% accuracy, which is better than both centralized learning (83.33%) and isolated local models (78.45% average) without revealing patient privacy. Through generous sheer ablation studies with statistical validation on 50 independent runs we demonstrate that proximal regularization is effective in curbing client drift in heterogeneous environments. This proof-of-concept research offers algorithmic insights and practical deployment guidelines for real-world federated healthcare systems, and thus, our results are directly transferable to hospital IT-administrators, implementing privacy-preserving collaborative learning."}

However, existing studies largely model RAREs as isotropic point receivers and overlook the spatial variations of atomic quantum states within vapor cells, thus inaccurately characterizing their reception patterns. To address this issue, we present a theoretical analysis of the aforementioned spatial responses of a standard local-oscillator (LO)- dressed RARE. Our results reveal that increasing the vapor-cell length produces a receive beam aligned with the LO field, with a beamwidth inversely proportional to the cell length. This finding enables atomic beamforming to enhance received signal-to-noise ratio using only a single-antenna RARE. Furthermore, we derive the achievable beamforming gain by characterizing and balancing the fundamental tradeoff between the effects of increasing the vapor cell length and the exponential power decay of laser propagating through the cell. To overcome the limitation imposed by exponential decay, we propose a novel RARE architecture termed segmental vapor cell. This architecture consists of vapor-cell segments separated by clear-air gaps, allowing the total cell length (and hence propagation loss) to remain fixed while the effective cell length increases. As a result, this segmented design expands the effective atom-field interaction area without increasing the total vapor cell length, yielding a narrower beamwidth and thus higher beamforming gain as compared with a traditional continuous vapor cell."}

In LLM-based agentic workflows, such violations can propagate and amplify along reasoning chains, causing task failures and system incidents. This paper presents NSVIF, a neuro-symbolic framework for verifying whether an LLM's output follows the instructions used to prompt the LLM. NSVIF is a universal, general-purpose verifier; it makes no assumption about the instruction or the LLM. NSVIF formulates instruction-following verification as a constraint-satisfaction problem by modeling user instructions as constraints. NSVIF models both logical and semantic constraints; constraint solving is done by a unified solver that orchestrates logical reasoning and semantic analysis. To evaluate NSVIF, we develop VIFBENCH, a new benchmark for instruction-following verifiers with fine-grained data labels. Experiments show that NSVIF significantly outperforms LLM-based approaches and provides interpretable feedback. We also show that feedback from NSVIF helps improve LLMs' instruction-following capability without post-training."}

While Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices offer a promising path for combinatorial acceleration, existing approaches typically treat the power grid as a \"black box\", suffering from poor scalability (barren plateaus) and frequent violations of physical constraints. Bridging these gaps, this paper proposes a Physics-Informed Hybrid Quantum-Classical Dispatching (PI-HQCD) framework. We construct a topology-aware Hamiltonian that explicitly embeds linearized power flow equations, storage dynamics, and multi-timescale coupling directly into the quantum substrate, significantly reducing the search space dimensionality. We further derive a noise-adaptive regularization mechanism that theoretically bounds the effective Lipschitz constant of the objective function, guaranteeing convergence stability under realistic quantum measurement noise. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 39-bus benchmark and a 118-bus regional grid demonstrate that PI-HQCD achieves superior economic efficiency and higher renewable utilization compared to stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP). Theoretical analysis confirms that this topology-aware design leads to an O(1/N) gradient variance scaling, effectively mitigating barren plateaus and ensuring scalability for larger networks. This work establishes a rigorous paradigm for embedding engineering physics into quantum computing, paving the way for practical quantum advantage in next-generation grid operations."}

The pipeline runs in approximately three minutes per patient on a single GPU, with no population-level training.\n  Using 1{,}000 synthetic spatiotemporal intensity maps (kymographs) with controlled noise and artifacts, the framework reliably identifies degraded data and outputs appropriately inflated uncertainty estimates, showing strong correspondence between predictive uncertainty and error (Pearson $r = 0.997$, Spearman $ρ= 0.998$). Clinical validation in 12 patients shows strong agreement between PUNCH-derived CFR and invasive bolus thermodilution (Pearson $r = 0.90$, $p = 6.3 \\times 10^{-5}$). We focus on the LAD, the artery most commonly assessed in routine CMD testing. Probabilistic CFR estimates have confidence intervals narrower than the variability of repeated invasive measurements.\n  By transforming routine angiography into quantitative, uncertainty-aware assessment, this approach enables scalable, safer, and more reproducible evaluation of coronary microvascular function.

In practical deployments, workloads span lightweight OCR to complex multimodal reasoning; using one MLLM for all queries either over-provisions compute on easy instances or sacrifices accuracy on hard ones. Query-level model selection (routing) addresses this tension, but extending routing from text-only LLMs to MLLMs is nontrivial due to modality fusion, wide variation in computational cost across models, and the absence of a standardized, budget-aware evaluation. We present MMR-Bench, a unified benchmark that isolates the multimodal routing problem and enables comparison under fixed candidate sets and cost models. MMR-Bench provides (i) a controlled environment with modality-aware inputs and variable compute budgets, (ii) a broad suite of vision-language tasks covering OCR, general VQA, and multimodal math reasoning, and (iii) strong single-model reference, oracle upper bounds, and representative routing policies. Using MMR-Bench, we show that incorporating multimodal signals improves routing quality. Empirically, these cues improve the cost-accuracy frontier and enable the routed system to exceed the strongest single model's accuracy at roughly 33% of its cost. Furthermore, policies trained on a subset of models and tasks generalize zero-shot to new datasets and text-only benchmarks without retuning, establishing MMR-Bench as a foundation for studying adaptive multimodal model selection and efficient MLLM deployment.

By applying alternating red and blue sideband pulses, we enforce a strict qubit-parity correlation and interference inherently insensitive to stable but unknown phases of the driving laser.

The neural network produces candidate solution states that are advanced by the numerical solver, and training minimizes the discrepancy between the network prediction and the solver-evolved state. This pull-push interaction enables the network to learn physically admissible solutions through repeated exposure to the solver's action, without requiring problem-specific loss engineering or explicit evaluation of differential equation residuals.

Across multiple memory-augmented agent frameworks and base LLMs, personalization increases attack success rates by 15.8%-243.7% relative to stateless baselines. We further provide mechanistic evidence for intent legitimation from internal representations space, and propose a lightweight detection-reflection method that effectively reduces safety degradation. Overall, our work provides the first systematic exploration and evaluation of intent legitimation as a safety failure mode that naturally arises from benign, real-world personalization, highlighting the importance of assessing safety under long-term personal context.

We further evaluate the secure key rate of both BB84 and twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) using quantum-dot single-photon sources and compare their performance with that of Poisson-distributed photon sources (PDS) such as weak coherent pulses and down-conversion sources. The analysis reveals that adiabatic excitation offers a modest but consistent enhancement in secure key rate relative to resonant excitation. Moreover, quantum-dot single-photon sources outperform PDS sources over short and intermediate distances; however, at longer distances, PDS sources eventually surpass quantum-dot sources in both infinite decoy-state BB84 and TF-QKD."}

Unlike prior approaches that are often tailored to specific deployment regimes, JetFormer is designed to operate effectively across the full spectrum of jet tagging scenarios, from high-accuracy offline analysis to ultra-low-latency online triggering. The model processes variable-length sets of particle features without relying on input of explicit pairwise interactions, yet achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. On the large-scale JetClass dataset, a large-scale JetFormer matches the accuracy of the interaction-rich ParT model (within 0.7%) while using 37.4% fewer FLOPs, demonstrating its computational efficiency and strong generalization. On benchmark HLS4ML 150P datasets, JetFormer consistently outperforms existing models such as MLPs, Deep Sets, and Interaction Networks by 3-4% in accuracy. To bridge the gap to hardware deployment, we further introduce a hardware-aware optimization pipeline based on multi-objective hyperparameter search, yielding compact variants like JetFormer-tiny suitable for FPGA-based trigger systems with sub-microsecond latency requirements. Through structured pruning and quantization, we show that JetFormer can be aggressively compressed with minimal accuracy loss. By unifying high-performance modeling and deployability within a single architectural framework, JetFormer provides a practical pathway for deploying Transformer-based jet taggers in both offline and online environments at the LHC.

Formulated as a latent variable model, UniCog encodes diverse abilities from dense model activations into sparse, disentangled latent dimensions. Through extensive analysis on six advanced LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3.2 and GPT-4o, we reveal a Pareto principle of LLM cognition, where a shared reasoning core is complemented by ability-specific signatures. Furthermore, we discover that reasoning failures often manifest as anomalous intensity in latent activations. These findings opens a new paradigm in LLM analysis, providing a cognition grounded view of reasoning dynamics.

We extend CDI to two-dimensional spatial conditioning, enabling probabilistic parameter inference directly from spatial observations. We validate this extension on convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) parameter inference - a challenging multi-parameter inverse problem in materials characterization where sample geometry, electronic structure, and thermal properties must be extracted from 2D diffraction patterns. Using simulated CBED data with ground-truth parameters, we demonstrate that CDI produces well-calibrated posterior distributions that accurately reflect measurement constraints: tight distributions for well-determined quantities and appropriately broad distributions for ambiguous parameters. In contrast, standard regression methods - while appearing accurate on aggregate metrics - mask this underlying uncertainty by predicting training set means for poorly constrained parameters. Our results confirm that CDI successfully extends from temporal to spatial domains, providing the genuine uncertainty information required for robust scientific inference."}

These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.\n  We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier.

This factorization improves sample efficiency by reducing the burden on any single policy and supports selective post-training: when the environment shifts from Phase 1 to Phase 2, only a subset of skills must be adapted, while upstream skills remain transferable.

We address this question by proving a universality theorem for the Many-body Projected Ensemble (MPE) framework, a method for quantum state design that uses a single many-body wave function to prepare random states. This demonstrates that MPE can approximate any distribution of pure states within a 1-Wasserstein distance error. This theorem provides a rigorous guarantee of universal expressivity, addressing key theoretical gaps in QML.

However, existing ZO methods typically employ isotropic perturbations, neglecting the rich structural information available during the forward pass. In this paper, we identify a crucial link between gradient formation and activation structure: the gradient of a linear layer is confined to the subspace spanned by its input activations. Leveraging this insight, we propose Activation-Guided Zeroth-Order optimization (AGZO). Unlike prior methods, AGZO extracts a compact, activation-informed subspace on the fly during the forward pass and restricts perturbations to this low-rank subspace. We provide a theoretical framework showing that AGZO optimizes a subspace-smoothed objective and provably yields update directions with higher cosine similarity to the true gradient than isotropic baselines. Empirically, we evaluate AGZO on Qwen3 and Pangu models across various benchmarks. AGZO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ZO baselines and significantly narrows the performance gap with first-order fine-tuning, while maintaining almost the same peak memory footprint as other ZO methods."}

However, such an approach still does not account for finite-shot effects or for quantum error mitigation (QEM), a key near-term error suppression strategy that reduces estimation bias at the cost of increased sampling overhead. We address this limitation by developing a benchmarking framework that explicitly incorporates finite-shot statistics and the resource overhead induced by QEM. Our framework quantifies quantum advantage through the confidence that an estimated energy lies within an interval defined by the best-known classical upper and lower bounds. Using a proof-of-principle numerical study of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model at size $8\\times8$, we demonstrate that the framework effectively identifies noise and shot-budget regimes in which the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), a representative QEM method, is operationally advantageous, and potential quantum advantage is not hindered by finite-shot effects.

Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) attempts to mitigate this by introducing a ``think-before-speak'' paradigm. However, applying RL directly in high-dimensional, discrete token spaces faces three inherent challenges: sample-inefficient rollouts, high gradient estimation variance, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To fundamentally address these structural bottlenecks, we propose \\textbf{DeepLatent Reasoning (DLR)}, a latent-space bidirectional contrastive reinforcement learning framework. This framework shifts the trial-and-error cost from expensive token-level full sequence generation to the continuous latent manifold. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight assistant model to efficiently sample $K$ reasoning chain encodings within the latent space. These encodings are filtered via a dual reward mechanism based on correctness and formatting; only high-value latent trajectories are fed into a \\textbf{frozen main model} for single-pass decoding. To maximize reasoning diversity while maintaining coherence, we design a contrastive learning objective to enable directed exploration within the latent space. Since the main model parameters remain frozen during optimization, this method mathematically eliminates catastrophic forgetting. Experiments demonstrate that under comparable GPU computational budgets, DLR achieves more stable training convergence, supports longer-horizon reasoning chains, and facilitates the sustainable accumulation of reasoning capabilities, providing a viable path toward reliable and scalable reinforcement learning for LLMs."}

By demonstrating that experts rely on holistic risk heuristics rather than granular factor discrimination, these findings suggest that aggregated labels function as arithmetic compromises that effectively erase grounded professional philosophies. Our results characterize expert disagreement in safety-critical AI as a sociotechnical phenomenon where professional experience introduces sophisticated layers of principled divergence. We discuss implications for reward modeling, safety classification, and evaluation benchmarks, recommending that practitioners shift from consensus-based aggregation to alignment methods that preserve and learn from expert disagreement."}

However, existing GAD methods follow a \"one model per dataset\" paradigm, leading to high computational costs, substantial data demands, and poor generalization when transferred to new datasets. This calls for a foundation model that enables a \"one-for-all\" GAD solution capable of detecting anomalies across diverse graphs without retraining. Yet, achieving this is challenging due to the large structural and feature heterogeneity across domains. In this paper, we propose TFM4GAD, a simple yet effective framework that adapts tabular foundation models (TFMs) for graph anomaly detection. Our key insight is that the core challenges of foundation GAD, handling heterogeneous features, generalizing across domains, and operating with scarce labels, are the exact problems that modern TFMs are designed to solve via synthetic pre-training and powerful in-context learning. The primary challenge thus becomes structural: TFMs are agnostic to graph topology. TFM4GAD bridges this gap by \"flattening\" the graph, constructing an augmented feature table that enriches raw node features with Laplacian embeddings, local and global structural characteristics, and anomaly-sensitive neighborhood aggregations. This augmented table is processed by a TFM in a fully in-context regime. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with various TFM backbones reveal that TFM4GAD surprisingly achieves significant performance gains over specialized GAD models trained from scratch. Our work offers a new perspective and a practical paradigm for leveraging TFMs as powerful, generalist graph anomaly detectors."}

Afterwards, we generalise the treatment to continuous bases, which showcases a problem with them, indicating that space (and other physical variables) may be discrete in nature. Some concrete examples are also given, including the generalisation to classical and quantum fields. Then, we treat some practical issues of this new stochastic approach, regarding the solving of problems in physics, which turns out to still be most tractable in the traditional way. Finally, we explain the classical limit, where a system of many particles is found to behave classically according to Newton's second law. Along with that, we present a way of solving the measurement problem, characterising what is an environment and a measuring device and explaining how the wavefunction collapse comes about. Specifically, it is found that what distinguishes an environment is its number of degrees of freedom, while a measuring device is a low-entropy type of environment."}

Instead of using a traditional static firewall approach, the DMAS agents communicate via a lightweight peer-to-peer protocol to cooperatively detect anomalous behavior across the IIoT network without sending data to a cloud infrastructure. The authors also outline a consensus-based threat validation (CVT) process in which agents vote on the threat level of an identified threat, enabling instant quarantine of a compromised node or nodes. The authors conducted experiments on a testbed that simulated an innovative factory environment with 2000 IIoT devices and found that the DMAS demonstrated sub-millisecond response times (average of 0.85ms), 97.3% accuracy in detecting malicious activity under high load, and 87% accuracy in detecting zero-day attacks. All significantly higher than baseline values for both centralized and edge computing.

Nevertheless, most existing methods do not fully utilize these edge weights. Leveraging edge weights in graph clustering tasks faces two critical challenges. (1) The introduction of edge weights may significantly increase storage space and training time, making it essential to reduce the graph scale while preserving nodes that are beneficial for the clustering task. (2) Edge weight information may inherently contain noise that negatively impacts clustering results. However, few studies can jointly optimize clustering and edge weights, which is crucial for mitigating the negative impact of noisy edges on clustering task. To address these challenges, we propose a contractile edge-weight-aware graph clustering network. Specifically, a cluster-oriented graph contraction module is designed to reduce the graph scale while preserving important nodes. An edge-weight-aware attention network is designed to identify and weaken noisy connections. In this way, we can more easily identify and mitigate the impact of noisy edges during the clustering process, thus enhancing clustering effectiveness. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world weighted graph datasets. In particular, our model outperforms the best baseline, demonstrating its superior performance.

Methods include a time-optimal bang-bang baseline, a zero-shot Monte Carlo Tree Search planner, and a Proximal Policy Optimisation policy. We report total energy consumption in watt-hours under identical physical dynamics. Across sweeps of initial temperature from 10 to 30 degrees Celsius, deadline from 30 to 90 steps, and target temperature from 40 to 80 degrees Celsius, PPO achieves the most energy-efficient performance at a 60-step horizon of 2 hours, using 3.23 kilowatt-hours, compared to 4.37 to 10.45 kilowatt-hours for bang-bang control and 4.18 to 6.46 kilowatt-hours for MCTS. This corresponds to energy savings of 26 percent at 30 steps and 69 percent at 90 steps. In a representative trajectory with a 50 kg water mass, 20 degrees Celsius ambient temperature, and a 60 degrees Celsius target, PPO consumes 54 percent less energy than bang-bang control and 33 percent less than MCTS. These results show that learned deadline-aware control reduces energy consumption under identical physical assumptions, while planners provide partial savings without training and learned policies offer near-zero inference cost once trained."}

To address this, we propose RouteMoA, an efficient mixture-of-agents framework with dynamic routing. It employs a lightweight scorer to perform initial screening by predicting coarse-grained performance from the query, narrowing candidates to a high-potential subset without inference. A mixture of judges then refines these scores through lightweight self- and cross-assessment based on existing model outputs, providing posterior correction without additional inference. Finally, a model ranking mechanism selects models by balancing performance, cost, and latency.

Here we present RareAlert, an early screening system which predict patient-level rare disease risk from routinely available primary-visit information. RareAlert integrates reasoning generated by ten LLMs, calibrates and weights these signals using machine learning, and distils the aligned reasoning into a single locally deployable model. To develop and evaluate RareAlert, we curated RareBench, a real-world dataset of 158,666 cases covering 33 Orphanet disease categories and more than 7,000 rare conditions, including both rare and non-rare presentations. The results showed that rare disease identification can be reconceptualised as a universal uncertainty resolution process applied to the general patient population.

We define an inferential efficiency as the ratio of information gain to cumulative memory erasure cost, with inefficiency arising from unexploited correlations between the measured system and memories, and/or between memories and environment (noise). Using this efficiency, we benchmark two limiting measurement paradigms: sequential, in which the same memory is exploited iteratively, and parallel, in which many memories are exploited simultaneously. In both cases, the minimal erasure cost reflects correlations across memories: temporal in sequential, spatial in parallel. Remarkably, when all system-memory correlations are exploited for inference, both paradigms attain the same minimal erasure cost, even in the presence of noise. Conversely, the parallel paradigm performs better in the presence of unexploited correlations, stemming from hidden memories' degrees of freedom.

This principle appears under many names -- rejection sampling with SFT, goal-conditioned RL, Decision Transformers -- yet what optimization problem it solves, if any, has remained unclear. We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a $χ^2$ divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all. We apply our theory to the common practice of return thresholding, showing this can amplify improvement, but at the cost of potential misalignment with the true objective."}

We study long-wavelength fluctuations of many-body ground states through the charge-density structure factor by incorporating intrinsic quantum fluctuations into hyperuniformity. Although charge fluctuations at zero temperature are generally suppressed by particle-number conservation, their long-wavelength scaling reveals distinct universal behaviors that define quantum hyperuniformity classes. By exemplifying the Aubry-Andre model, we find that gapped, gapless, and localized-critical-extended phases are sharply distinguished by the quantum hyperuniformity classes. Notably, at the critical point, multifractal wave functions generate anomalous scaling behavior. We further show that, in quantum-hyperuniform gapped phases, the quantum weight provides a quantitative measure of the gap size through a universal power-law scaling. Along with classical hyperuniformity, quantum hyperuniformity serves a direct fingerprint of quantum criticality and a practical probe of quantum phase transitions in aperiodic electron systems."}

Specifically, we train an Intuitive Critic Model (ICM) using positive and negative action examples from a base agent first. This critic evaluates the immediate correctness of the agent's intended actions, thereby selecting operations with higher success probability. Then, the initial critic guides agent actions to collect refined positive/negative samples, initiating the self-improving cycle. The augmented data then trains a second-round critic with enhanced discernment capability. We conduct experiments on various datasets and demonstrate that the proposed ICM can improve the test-time performance of various closed-source and open-source models, and the performance can be gradually improved as the data is recycled. The code and dataset will be publicly released."}

We introduce Robust Privacy (RP), an inference-time privacy notion inspired by certified robustness: if a model's prediction is provably invariant within a radius-$R$ neighborhood around an input $x$ (e.g., under the $\\ell_2$ norm), then $x$ enjoys $R$-Robust Privacy, i.e., observing the prediction cannot distinguish $x$ from any input within distance $R$ of $x$. We further develop Attribute Privacy Enhancement (APE) to translate input-level invariance into an attribute-level privacy effect. In a controlled recommendation task where the decision depends primarily on a sensitive attribute, we show that RP expands the set of sensitive-attribute values compatible with a positive recommendation, expanding the inference interval accordingly. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that RP also mitigates model inversion attacks (MIAs) by masking fine-grained input-output dependence. Even at small noise levels ($σ=0.1$), RP reduces the attack success rate (ASR) from 73% to 4% with partial model performance degradation. RP can also partially mitigate MIAs (e.g., ASR drops to 44%) with no model performance degradation."}

We first examine the properties of TSFMs under standard sampling often fail to adhere to scaling laws due to insufficient exploration of the solution space. Building on this, we then delve into diversified inference scaling via tailored time series perturbations to expand the generative distribution's support. We theoretically analyze the diversity-fidelity trade-off and derive a critical sample threshold for diversified sampling to outperform standard sampling. Extensive experiments across various TSFMs and datasets show proper diversified inference scaling yields substantial performance gains without parameter updates, establishing inference design as a critical, compute-efficient dimension of TSFM optimization. As an application, we propose RobustMSE, a rigorous metric to quantify the headroom performance of TSFM under a fixed budget.

In this work, we investigate the challenge of agentic post-training when the eventual test domains are unknown. Specifically, we analyze which properties of reinforcement learning (RL) environments and modeling choices have the greatest influence on out-of-domain performance. First, we identify two environment axes that strongly correlate with cross-domain generalization: (i) state information richness, i.e., the amount of information for the agent to process from the state, and (ii) planning complexity, estimated via goal reachability and trajectory length under a base policy. Notably, domain realism and text-level similarity are not the primary factors; for instance, the simple grid-world domain Sokoban leads to even stronger generalization in SciWorld than the more realistic ALFWorld. Motivated by these findings, we further show that increasing state information richness alone can already effectively improve cross-domain robustness. We propose a randomization technique, which is low-overhead and broadly applicable: add small amounts of distractive goal-irrelevant features to the state to make it richer without altering the task. Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization."}

In this regime, classical energy-based diagnostics and unconstrained learned representations are structurally insensitive, leading to delayed or unstable detection. We introduce GO-OSC, a geometry-aware representation learning framework for oscillatory time series that enforces a canonical and identifiable latent parameterization, enabling stable comparison and aggregation across short, unlabeled windows. Building on this representation, we define a family of invariant linear geometric probes that target degradation-relevant directions in latent space. We provide theoretical results showing that under early phase-only degradation, energy-based statistics have zero first-order detection power, whereas geometric probes achieve strictly positive sensitivity. Our analysis characterizes when and why linear probing fails under non-identifiable representations and shows how canonicalization restores statistical detectability. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real vibration datasets validate the theory, demonstrating earlier detection, improved data efficiency, and robustness to operating condition changes."}

D-SENO combines dilated convolution (DC) blocks with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) modules to jointly capture wide receptive fields and dynamics alongside channel-wise attention, enabling both accurate and efficient PDE inference. Carefully chosen dilation rates allow the receptive field to focus on critical regions, effectively modeling long-range physical dependencies. Meanwhile, the SE modules adaptively recalibrate feature channels to emphasize dynamically relevant scales. Our model achieves training speed of up to approximately $20\\times$ faster than standard transformer-based models and neural operators, while also surpassing (or matching) them in accuracy across multiple PDE benchmarks.

This approach treats sequential task interactions as a continuous stream of experience, enabling the system to distill short-term execution feedback into long-term, reusable capabilities without access to ground-truth labels.

Existing literature primarily assumes well-annotated training graphs, while the reliability of labels is not guaranteed in real-world scenarios. Recently, efforts have been made to address the problem of graph learning with label noise. However, existing methods often (i) struggle to distinguish between reliable and unreliable nodes, and (ii) overlook the relational information embedded in the graph topology. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel method, Dual-Standard Semantic Homogeneity with Dynamic Optimization (DREAM), for reliable, relation-informed optimization on graphs with label noise. Specifically, we design a relation-informed dynamic optimization framework that iteratively reevaluates the reliability of each labeled node in the graph during the optimization process according to the relation of the target node and other nodes. To measure this relation comprehensively, we propose a dual-standard selection strategy that selects a set of anchor nodes based on both node proximity and graph topology. Subsequently, we compute the semantic homogeneity between the target node and the anchor nodes, which serves as guidance for optimization. We also provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to justify the design of DREAM. Extensive experiments are performed on six graph datasets across various domains under three types of graph label noise against competing baselines, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DREAM."}

Although trajectories contain useful signals, directly using trace text or vanilla hidden states for detection is brittle: traces vary in form and detectors can overfit to superficial patterns rather than answer validity. We introduce Answer-agreement Representation Shaping (ARS), which learns detection-friendly trace-conditioned representations by explicitly encoding answer stability. ARS generates counterfactual answers through small latent interventions, specifically, perturbing the trace-boundary embedding, and labels each perturbation by whether the resulting answer agrees with the original. It then learns representations that bring answer-agreeing states together and separate answer-disagreeing ones, exposing latent instability indicative of hallucination risk. The shaped embeddings are plug-and-play with existing embedding-based detectors and require no human annotations during training. Experiments demonstrate that ARS consistently improves detection and achieves substantial gains over strong baselines."}

GraphRAG optimisation enhances query performance across semantic communities that include seismic wave simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and performance tuning libraries. A reverse engineering component derives three-level query strategies for RAG retrieval through static analysis of Fortran source code.

However, the presence of label noise in real scenarios poses a significant challenge in learning robust GNNs, and their effectiveness can be severely impacted when dealing with noisy labels on graphs, often stemming from annotation errors or inconsistencies. To address this, in this paper we propose a novel approach called ICGNN that harnesses the structure information of the graph to effectively alleviate the challenges posed by noisy labels. Specifically, we first design a novel noise indicator that measures the influence contradiction score (ICS) based on the graph diffusion matrix to quantify the credibility of nodes with clean labels, such that nodes with higher ICS values are more likely to be detected as having noisy labels. Then we leverage the Gaussian mixture model to precisely detect whether the label of a node is noisy or not. Additionally, we develop a soft strategy to combine the predictions from neighboring nodes on the graph to correct the detected noisy labels. At last, pseudo-labeling for abundant unlabeled nodes is incorporated to provide auxiliary supervision signals and guide the model optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the superiority of our proposed approach."}

In this paper, we demonstrate that expensive online reinforcement learning is not all you need to build powerful research agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully open-source suite designed for effective offline training. Our core contributions include DeepForge, a ready-to-use task synthesis framework that generates large-scale research queries without heavy preprocessing; and a curated collection of 66k QA pairs, 33k SFT trajectories, and 21k DPO pairs.

DeepResearch (DR) models ground outputs in verifiable evidence from tools and perform strongly in general domains, but their direct transfer to medical field yields relatively limited gains. We attribute this to two gaps: task characteristic and tool-use scaling. Medical questions require evidence interpretation in a knowledge-intensive clinical context; while general DR models can retrieve information, they often lack clinical-context reasoning and thus \"find it but fail to use it,\" leaving performance limited by medical abilities. Moreover, in medical scenarios, blindly scaling tool-call can inject noisy context, derailing sensitive medical reasoning and prompting repetitive evidence-seeking along incorrect paths. Therefore, we propose DeepMed. For data, we deploy a multi-hop med-search QA synthesis method supporting the model to apply the DR paradigm in medical contexts. For training, we introduce a difficulty-aware turn-penalty to suppress excessive tool-call growth. For inference, we bring a monitor to help validate hypotheses within a controlled number of steps and avoid context rot.

To address these challenges, we propose SpatialMath, a novel Spatial Comprehension-Infused Symbolic Reasoning Framework designed to integrate spatial representations into structured symbolic reasoning chains. SpatialMath employs a specialized perception module to extract spatially-grounded representations from visual diagrams, capturing critical geometric structures and spatial relationships. These representations are then methodically infused into symbolic reasoning chains, facilitating visual comprehension-aware structured reasoning. To this end, we introduce MATHVERSE-PLUS, a novel dataset containing structured visual interpretations and step-by-step reasoning paths for vision-intensive mathematical problems. SpatialMath significantly outperforms strong multimodal baselines, achieving up to 10 percentage points improvement over supervised fine-tuning with data augmentation in vision-intensive settings.

When these systems fail, the problem is often not the language model itself, but that the nearest neighbors in the embedding space correspond to the wrong cases. Modern machine learning systems increasingly rely on fixed, high-dimensional embeddings produced by large pretrained models and sentence encoders. In real-world deployments, labels are scarce, domains shift over time, and retraining the base encoder is expensive or infeasible. As a result, downstream performance depends heavily on embedding geometry. Yet raw embeddings are often poorly aligned with the local neighborhood structure required by nearest-neighbor retrieval, similarity search, and lightweight classifiers that operate directly on embeddings. We propose PEARL (Prototype-Enhanced Aligned Representation Learning), a label-efficient approach that uses limited supervision to softly align embeddings toward class prototypes. The method reshapes local neighborhood geometry while preserving dimensionality and avoiding aggressive projection or collapse. Its aim is to bridge the gap between purely unsupervised post-processing, which offers limited and inconsistent gains, and fully supervised projections that require substantial labeled data. We evaluate PEARL under controlled label regimes ranging from extreme label scarcity to higher-label settings. In the label-scarce condition, PEARL substantially improves local neighborhood quality, yielding 25.7% gains over raw embeddings and more than 21.1% gains relative to strong unsupervised post-processing, precisely in the regime where similarity-based systems are most brittle."}

In this work, we analyze how stabilizing training dynamics affects the induced generation distribution. We show that under standard maximum likelihood training, stable parameter trajectories lead stationary solutions to approximately minimize the forward KL divergence to the empirical distribution, while implicitly reducing generative entropy. As a consequence, the learned model can concentrate probability mass on a limited subset of empirical modes, exhibiting systematic degeneration despite smooth loss convergence. We empirically validate this effect using a controlled feedback-based training framework that stabilizes internal generation statistics, observing consistent low-entropy outputs and repetitive behavior across architectures and random seeds. It indicates that optimization stability and generative expressivity are not inherently aligned, and that stability alone is an insufficient indicator of generative quality."}

Since most data collected from edge devices are unlabeled, unsupervised Federated Clustering (FC) is becoming increasingly popular for exploring pattern knowledge from complex distributed data. However, due to the lack of label guidance, the common Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) issue of clients have greatly challenged FC by posing the following problems: How to fuse pattern knowledge (i.e., cluster distribution) from Non-IID clients; How are the cluster distributions among clients related; and How does this relationship connect with the global knowledge fusion? In this paper, a more tricky but overlooked phenomenon in Non-IID is revealed, which bottlenecks the clustering performance of the existing FC approaches. That is, different clients could fragment a cluster, and accordingly, a more generalized Non-IID concept, i.e., Non-ICD (Non-Independent Completely Distributed), is derived. To tackle the above FC challenges, a new framework named GOLD (Global Oriented Local Distribution Learning) is proposed. GOLD first finely explores the potential incomplete local cluster distributions of clients, then uploads the distribution summarization to the server for global fusion, and finally performs local cluster enhancement under the guidance of the global distribution. Extensive experiments, including significance tests, ablation studies, scalability evaluations, qualitative results, etc., have been conducted to show the superiority of GOLD."}

In this work, we propose a novel method that uses feedback from the logic solver to augment a logic problem with commonsense relations provided by the LLM, in an iterative manner. This involves a search procedure through potential commonsense assumptions to maximize the chance of finding useful facts while keeping cost tractable. On a collection of pure-logical reasoning datasets, from which some commonsense information has been removed, our method consistently achieves considerable improvements over existing techniques, demonstrating the value in balancing neural and symbolic elements when working in human contexts."}

In this work, we propose Unsupervised Imitation Learning from Observation (UfO) that addresses all of these limitations. UfO learns a policy through a two-stage process, in which the agent first obtains an approximation of the teacher's true actions in the observed state transitions, and then refines the learned policy further by adjusting agent trajectories to closely align them with the teacher's. Experiments we conducted in five widely used environments show that UfO not only outperforms the teacher and all other ILfO methods but also displays the smallest standard deviation. This reduction in standard deviation indicates better generalisation in unseen scenarios."}

Our results show that both speech- and text-based models follow a sequence of learning stages: during training, their neural activations successively build subspaces, where the geometry of the neural activations represents phonemic, lexical, and syntactic structure.

While LLMs offer potential for accessible emotional assistance, their reliability, therapeutic relevance, and alignment with human standards remain challenging to address. This paper introduces a human-grounded evaluation methodology designed to assess LLM generated responses in therapeutic dialogue. Our approach involved curating a dataset of 500 mental health conversations from datasets with real-world scenario questions and evaluating the responses generated by nine diverse LLMs, including closed source and open source models. More specifically, these responses were evaluated by two psychiatric trained experts, who independently rated each on a 5 point Likert scale across a comprehensive 6 attribute rubric. This rubric captures Cognitive Support and Affective Resonance, providing a multidimensional perspective on therapeutic quality. Our analysis reveals that LLMs provide strong cognitive reliability by producing safe, coherent, and clinically appropriate information, but they demonstrate unstable affective alignment. Although closed source models (e.g., GPT-4o) offer balanced therapeutic responses, open source models show greater variability and emotional flatness. We reveal a persistent cognitive-affective gap and highlight the need for failure aware, clinically grounded evaluation frameworks that prioritize relational sensitivity alongside informational accuracy in mental health oriented LLMs. We advocate for balanced evaluation protocols with human in the loop that center on therapeutic sensitivity and provide a framework to guide the responsible design and clinical oversight of mental health oriented conversational AI."}

This raises a fundamental question: how can learning produce abstraction and insight without violating information-theoretic limits?\n  We argue that learning is inherently an irreversible process when performed over finite time, and that the realization of epistemic structure necessarily incurs entropy production. To formalize this perspective, we model learning as a transport process in the space of probability distributions over model configurations and introduce an epistemic free-energy framework.\n  Within this framework, we define the free-energy drop as a bookkeeping quantity that records the total reduction of epistemic free energy along a learning trajectory.

Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \\textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw."}

As such, it is imperative that decoding models are able to generalize across variations, such as recordings from different brain sites, distinct sessions, different types of behavior, and a variety of subjects. Current models can only partially address these challenges and warrant the development of pretrained neural transformer models capable to adapt and generalize. In this work, we propose RPNT - Robust Pretrained Neural Transformer, designed to achieve robust generalization through pretraining, which in turn enables effective finetuning given a downstream task. In particular, RPNT unique components include 1) Multidimensional rotary positional embedding (MRoPE) to aggregate experimental metadata such as site coordinates, session name and behavior types; 2) Context-based attention mechanism via convolution kernels operating on global attention to learn local temporal structures for handling non-stationarity of neural population activity; 3) Robust self-supervised learning (SSL) objective with uniform causal masking strategies and contrastive representations. We pretrained two separate versions of RPNT on distinct datasets a) Multi-session, multi-task, and multi-subject microelectrode benchmark; b) Multi-site recordings using high-density Neuropixel 1.0 probes. The datasets include recordings from the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and from the primary motor cortex (M1) regions of nonhuman primates (NHPs) as they performed reaching tasks. After pretraining, we evaluated the generalization of RPNT in cross-session, cross-type, cross-subject, and cross-site downstream behavior decoding tasks. Our results show that RPNT consistently achieves and surpasses the decoding performance of existing decoding models in all tasks."}

We show that Health-SCORE provides two practical benefits beyond standalone evaluation: it can be used as a structured reward signal to guide reinforcement learning with safety-aware supervision, and it can be incorporated directly into prompts to improve response quality through in-context learning. Across open-ended healthcare tasks, Health-SCORE achieves evaluation quality comparable to human-created rubrics while significantly lowering development effort, making rubric-based evaluation and training more scalable."}

In this study, we present a novel, AI-assisted drug design approach to promote targeted degradation of Abeta-42 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), using E3 ligase-directed molecular glues. We systematically evaluated the ternary complex formation potential of Abeta-42 with three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and MDM2, through structure-based modeling, ADMET screening, and docking.

Our results demonstrate that this generative model can produce chemically valid, novel, and target-specific molecular glues capable of facilitating Abeta-42 degradation.

Leveraging SSH as a proxy for sea ice dynamics enables improved understanding of the feedback mechanisms driving polar climate change and global sea-level rise. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle with reliable treatment effect estimation in spatiotemporal settings due to unobserved confounders and the absence of physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose the Knowledge-Guided Causal Model Variational Autoencoder (KGCM-VAE) to quantify causal mechanisms between sea ice thickness and SSH. The proposed framework integrates a velocity modulation scheme in which smoothed velocity signals are dynamically amplified via a sigmoid function governed by SSH transitions to generate physically grounded causal treatments. In addition, the model incorporates Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to balance treated and control covariate distributions in the latent space, along with a causal adjacency-constrained decoder to ensure alignment with established physical structures. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world Arctic datasets demonstrate that KGCM-VAE achieves superior PEHE compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the approach, showing that the joint application of MMD and causal adjacency constraints yields a 1.88\\% reduction in estimation error."}

We introduce Agora, a framework that reframes coordination as a decentralized market for uncertainty. Agora formalizes epistemic uncertainty into a structured, tradable asset (perceptual, semantic, inferential), and enforces profitability-driven trading among agents based on rational economic rules. A market-aware broker, extending Thompson Sampling, initiates collaboration and guides the system toward cost-efficient equilibria. Experiments on five multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, MMBench, MathVision, InfoVQA, CC-OCR) show that Agora outperforms strong VLMs and heuristic multi-agent strategies, e.g., achieving +8.5% accuracy over the best baseline on MMMU while reducing cost by over 3x.

Based on this finding, we design Kareus, a training system that pushes the time--energy tradeoff frontier by optimizing both aspects. Kareus decomposes the intractable joint optimization problem into local, partition-based subproblems. It then uses a multi-pass multi-objective optimization algorithm to find execution schedules that push the time--energy tradeoff frontier. Compared to the state of the art, Kareus reduces training energy by up to 28.3% at the same training time, or reduces training time by up to 27.5% at the same energy consumption."}

Instead of forcing the model to memorize vast chemical data, our approach empowers the language model to interact with a sandbox for precise information retrieval. This externalization of knowledge allows a locally deployable small model to achieve superior performance with minimal inference costs. To enable small language models for agent-calling ability, we build an agentic trajectory construction pipeline and a comprehensive chemical-agent sandbox.

Although these models are extremely large, their sparse activation enables inference to be performed by accessing only a fraction of the model at a time. This property opens the possibility of on-device inference of MoE, which was previously considered infeasible for such large models. Consequently, various systems have been proposed to leverage this sparsity and enable efficient MoE inference for edge devices. However, previous MoE inference systems like Fiddler[8] or DAOP[13] rely on DRAM-based offloading and are not suitable for memory constrained on-device environments. As recent MoE models grow to hundreds of gigabytes, RAM-offloading solutions become impractical. To address this, we propose FlashMoE, a system that offloads inactive experts to SSD, enabling efficient MoE inference under limited RAM. FlashMoE incorporates a lightweight ML-based caching strategy that adaptively combines recency and frequency signals to maximize expert reuse, significantly reducing storage I/O. In addition, we built a user-grade desktop platform to demonstrate the practicality of FlashMoE. On this real hardware setup, FlashMoE improves cache hit rate by up to 51% over well-known offloading policies such as LRU and LFU, and achieves up to 2.6x speedup compared to existing MoE inference systems."}

These models can act as surrogates for volume data, enabling efficient storage and on-demand reconstruction via model predictions. However, conventional deterministic INRs only provide value predictions without insights into the model's prediction uncertainty or the impact of inherent noisiness in the data. This limitation can lead to unreliable data interpretation and visualization due to prediction inaccuracies in the reconstructed volume. Identifying erroneous results extracted from model-predicted data may be infeasible, as raw data may be unavailable due to its large size. To address this challenge, we introduce REV-INR, Regularized Evidential Implicit Neural Representation, which learns to predict data values accurately along with the associated coordinate-level data uncertainty and model uncertainty using only a single forward pass of the trained REV-INR during inference. By comprehensively comparing and contrasting REV-INR with existing well-established deep uncertainty estimation methods, we show that REV-INR achieves the best volume reconstruction quality with robust data (aleatoric) and model (epistemic) uncertainty estimates using the fastest inference time. Consequently, we demonstrate that REV-INR facilitates assessment of the reliability and trustworthiness of the extracted isosurfaces and volume visualization results, enabling analyses to be solely driven by model-predicted data."}

Existing approaches limit in fixed client selection and aggregation on cloud server, making the privacy-preserving extraction of client-specific information during local training challenging. To this end, we propose Client-Centric Adaptation federated learning (FedCCA), an algorithm that optimally utilizes client-specific knowledge to learn a unique model for each client through selective adaptation, aiming to alleviate the influence of data heterogeneity. Specifically, FedCCA employs dynamic client selection and adaptive aggregation based on the additional client-specific encoder. To enhance multi-source knowledge transfer, we adopt an attention-based global aggregation strategy. We conducted extensive experiments on diverse datasets to assess the efficacy of FedCCA. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits a substantial performance advantage over competing baselines in addressing this specific problem."}

Moreover, in practical scenarios such as adding/dropping teammates or facing environment dynamics that differ from the training, CTDE methods can be brittle and costly to retrain, whereas distributed approaches allow agents to adapt using only local information and peer-to-peer communication. We present a distributed MARL framework that removes the need for centralized critics or global information. Firstly, we develop a novel Distributed Graph Attention Network (D-GAT) that performs global state inference through multi-hop communication, where agents integrate neighbor features via input-dependent attention weights in a fully distributed manner. Leveraging D-GAT, we develop the distributed graph-attention MAPPO (DG-MAPPO) -- a distributed MARL framework where agents optimize local policies and value functions using local observations, multi-hop communication, and shared/averaged rewards. Empirical evaluation on the StarCraftII Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, and Multi-Agent Mujoco demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines, achieving superior coordination across a wide range of cooperative tasks with both homogeneous and heterogeneous teams. Our distributed MARL framework provides a principled and scalable solution for robust collaboration, eliminating the need for centralized training or global observability. To the best of our knowledge, DG-MAPPO appears to be the first to fully eliminate reliance on privileged centralized information, enabling agents to learn and act solely through peer-to-peer communication."}

While prior work has explored information-seeking behavior through word games, existing benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that provide both final and intermediate signals based on Information Gain (IG). Moreover, they rarely provide systematic comparisons between models that use chain-of-thought reasoning and those that do not. We propose a multi-turn dialogue framework that quantitatively measures how effectively LLMs gather information through yes/no questions in a hierarchical knowledge graph environment. Our framework employs a triad of interacting LLM agents that ask questions, answer them, and update the hypothesis space. We adopt IG as the main metric, grounded in Shannon entropy, to assess query effectiveness at each turn and cumulatively. We instantiate our framework in a geographical Guess My City game setting organized in a five-level taxonomy and evaluate multiple LLM variants under fully and partially observable conditions, with and without Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that, among the evaluated models, the ones with explicit reasoning capabilities achieve higher IG per turn and reach solutions in fewer steps, particularly in partially observable settings. Analysis of reasoning traces reveals that smaller models compensate for limited capacity through more aggressive exploration of candidate questions, while larger models exhibit higher assertiveness in selecting optimal queries, generating candidates with greater potential IG."}

Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with a single token stream, a single next-token objective, and a single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, a unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under a single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via a lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stability-creativity trade-offs via a finite-state decoding mechanism.

However, real-world web-scale settings are rife with missing views and continuously emerging classes, which pose significant obstacles to robust learning. Prevailing methods are ill-equipped for this reality, as they either lack adaptability to new classes or incur exponential parameter growth when handling all possible missing-view patterns, severely limiting their scalability in web environments. To systematically address this gap, we formally introduce a novel task, termed \\emph{incomplete multi-view multi-label class incremental learning} (IMvMLCIL), which requires models to simultaneously address heterogeneous missing views and dynamic class expansion. To tackle this task, we propose \\textsf{E2PL}, an Effective and Efficient Prompt Learning framework for IMvMLCIL. \\textsf{E2PL} unifies two novel prompt designs: \\emph{task-tailored prompts} for class-incremental adaptation and \\emph{missing-aware prompts} for the flexible integration of arbitrary view-missing scenarios. To fundamentally address the exponential parameter explosion inherent in missing-aware prompts, we devise an \\emph{efficient prototype tensorization} module, which leverages atomic tensor decomposition to elegantly reduce the prompt parameter complexity from exponential to linear w.r.t. the number of views. We further incorporate a \\emph{dynamic contrastive learning} strategy explicitly model the complex dependencies among diverse missing-view patterns, thus enhancing the model's robustness.

At the system level, this non-determinism arises from floating-point non-associativity combined with dynamic batching and GPU kernels whose reduction orders vary with batch size. A straightforward way to eliminate non-determinism is to disable dynamic batching during inference, but doing so severely degrades throughput. Another approach is to make kernels batch-invariant; however, this tightly couples determinism to kernel design, requiring new implementations. This coupling also imposes fixed runtime overheads, regardless of how much of the workload actually requires determinism.\n  Inspired by ideas from speculative decoding, we present LLM-42, a scheduling-based approach to enable determinism in LLM inference. Our key observation is that if a sequence is in a consistent state, the next emitted token is likely to be consistent even with dynamic batching. Moreover, most GPU kernels use shape-consistent reductions. Leveraging these insights, LLM-42 decodes tokens using a non-deterministic fast path and enforces determinism via a lightweight verify-rollback loop. The verifier replays candidate tokens under a fixed-shape reduction schedule, commits those that are guaranteed to be consistent across runs, and rolls back those violating determinism. LLM-42 mostly re-uses existing kernels unchanged and incurs overhead only in proportion to the traffic that requires determinism."}

This behavior is arguably natural-and even desirable - as imbalanced routing allows models to concentrate domain-specific knowledge within a subset of experts. Expert parallelism (EP) is designed to scale MoE models by distributing experts across multiple devices, but with a less-discussed assumption of balanced routing. Under extreme imbalance, EP can funnel a disproportionate number of tokens to a small number of experts, leading to compute- and memory-bound failures on overloaded devices during post-training or inference, where explicit load balancing is often inapplicable. We propose Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism (LLEP), a novel EP algorithm that dynamically reroutes excess tokens and associated expert parameters from overloaded devices to underutilized ones. This ensures that all devices complete their workloads within the minimum collective latency while respecting memory constraints. Across different model scales, LLEP achieves up to 5x speedup and 4x reduction in peak memory usage compared to standard EP. This enables faster and higher-throughput post-training and inference, with ~1.9x faster for gpt-oss-120b. We support our method with extensive theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations, including ablation studies. These results illuminate key trade-offs and enable a principled framework for hardware-specific hyper-parameter tuning to achieve optimal performance."}

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of TabPFN and its fine-tuned variants, assessing predictive performance, fairness, and robustness across varying dataset sizes and distributional shifts.

While Federated Learning (FL) provides a framework for collaboration without raw data exchange, its classic centralized form introduces a single point of failure and remains vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Decentralized FL (DFL) mitigates this risk by removing the central aggregator but typically relies on inefficient, random peer-to-peer (P2P) pairings, forming a collaboration graph that is blind to agent heterogeneity and risks negative transfer. This paper introduces KNEXA-FL, a novel framework for orchestrated decentralization that resolves this trade-off. KNEXA-FL employs a non-aggregating Central Profiler/Matchmaker (CPM) that formulates P2P collaboration as a contextual bandit problem, using a LinUCB algorithm on abstract agent profiles to learn an optimal matchmaking policy. It orchestrates direct knowledge exchange between heterogeneous, PEFT-based LLM agents via secure distillation, without ever accessing the models themselves. Our comprehensive experiments on a challenging code generation task show that KNEXA-FL yields substantial gains, improving Pass@1 by approx. 50% relative to random P2P collaboration. Critically, our orchestrated approach demonstrates stable convergence, in stark contrast to a powerful centralized distillation baseline which suffers from catastrophic performance collapse. Our work establishes adaptive, learning-based orchestration as a foundational principle for building robust and effective decentralized AI ecosystems."}

UniPACT's core contribution is a structured prompting mechanism that converts numerical EHR data into semantically rich text. This textualized patient context is then fused with representations learned directly from raw ECG waveforms, enabling an LLM to reason over both modalities holistically. We evaluate UniPACT on the comprehensive MDS-ED benchmark, it achieves a state-of-the-art mean AUROC of 89.37% across a diverse set of prognostic tasks including diagnosis, deterioration, ICU admission, and mortality, outperforming specialized baselines.

We introduce Conservative & Aggressive NaNs, two novel variants of max pooling and unpooling that identify numerically unstable voxels and replace them with NaNs, allowing subsequent layers to skip computations on irrelevant data. Both methods are implemented within PyTorch and require no architectural changes. We evaluate these approaches on four CNN models spanning neuroimaging and image classification tasks. For inputs containing at least 50% NaNs, we observe consistent runtime improvements; for data with more than two-thirds NaNs )common in several neuroimaging settings) we achieve an average inference speedup of 1.67x. Conservative NaNs reduces convolution operations by an average of 30% across models and datasets, with no measurable performance degradation, and can skip up to 64.64% of convolutions in specific layers. Aggressive NaNs can skip up to 69.30% of convolutions but may occasionally affect performance.

To address this, we propose Streaming-dLLM, a training-free framework that streamlines inference across both spatial and temporal dimensions.

Federated Learning offers a way out to this problem by facilitating collaborative model training without having the raw patient data centralized. However, clinical datasets intrinsically have non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) features brought about by demographic disparity and diversity in disease prevalence and institutional practices. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation research of Federated Proximal Optimization (FedProx) for Heart Disease prediction based on UCI Heart Disease dataset. We generate realistic non-IID data partitions by simulating four heterogeneous hospital clients from the Cleveland Clinic dataset (303 patients), by inducing statistical heterogeneity by demographic-based stratification. Our experimental results show that FedProx with proximal parameter mu=0.05 achieves 85.00% accuracy, which is better than both centralized learning (83.33%) and isolated local models (78.45% average) without revealing patient privacy. Through generous sheer ablation studies with statistical validation on 50 independent runs we demonstrate that proximal regularization is effective in curbing client drift in heterogeneous environments. This proof-of-concept research offers algorithmic insights and practical deployment guidelines for real-world federated healthcare systems, and thus, our results are directly transferable to hospital IT-administrators, implementing privacy-preserving collaborative learning."}

Forgetting and regularization are not heuristic add-ons but structural requirements for adaptive systems. Drawing on information theory, thermodynamics, and information geometry, we introduce the BEDS (Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures) framework, modeling learning as the evolution of compressed belief states under dissipation constraints.\n  A central contribution is the Conditional Optimality Theorem, showing that Fisher-Rao regularization measuring change via information divergence rather than Euclidean distance is the unique thermodynamically optimal regularization strategy, achieving minimal dissipation. Euclidean regularization is shown to be structurally suboptimal. The framework unifies existing methods (Ridge, SIGReg, EMA, SAC) as special cases of a single governing equation.\n  Within this view, overfitting corresponds to over-crystallization, while catastrophic forgetting reflects insufficient dissipation control. The framework distinguishes BEDS-crystallizable problems, where beliefs converge to stable equilibria, from BEDS-maintainable problems, which require continual adaptation. It extends naturally to continual and multi-agent systems, where viability, stability under adaptation and finite resources replaces asymptotic optimality as the primary criterion. Overall, this work reframes learning as maintaining viable belief states under dissipation constraints, providing a principled lens on forgetting, regularization, and stability."}

In Mistral, capability is sharply non-monotonic: aggregated logic-probe margins become positive only in a narrow band near $β\\approx 10^{-2}$ and revert outside it, with boundary points that are seed-sensitive. Across architectures under the same sweep, we observe qualitatively different response modes: sharp reorganization in Mistral, selective changes in Llama, and smooth trade-offs in Qwen. Critically, the DPO preference margin can anticorrelate with reasoning capability (Pearson $r=-0.91$ for Llama logic), so margin-based selection can prefer capability-impaired models. Training path also matters: exposure to high $β$ induces capability losses that persist even after $β$ is reduced (hysteresis). These findings motivate capability-resolved evaluation across the $β$ landscape rather than reliance on margins or aggregate benchmarks."}

Our key contribution is a Boundary Embedding Exchange protocol that shares only compressed, non-invertible graph neural network representations of boundary accounts. These exchanges are secured using post-quantum cryptography, specifically the NIST-standardized Kyber-512 key encapsulation mechanism combined with AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption. Experiments on the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset with realistic Louvain partitioning show that FedGraph-VASP achieves an F1-score of 0.508, outperforming the state-of-the-art generative baseline FedSage+ (F1 = 0.453) by 12.1 percent on binary fraud detection. We further show robustness under low-connectivity settings where generative imputation degrades performance, while approaching centralized performance (F1 = 0.620) in high-connectivity regimes. We additionally evaluate generalization on an Ethereum fraud detection dataset, where FedGraph-VASP (F1 = 0.635) is less effective under sparse cross-silo connectivity, while FedSage+ excels (F1 = 0.855), outperforming even local training (F1 = 0.785).

Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) attempts to mitigate this by introducing a ``think-before-speak'' paradigm. However, applying RL directly in high-dimensional, discrete token spaces faces three inherent challenges: sample-inefficient rollouts, high gradient estimation variance, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To fundamentally address these structural bottlenecks, we propose \\textbf{DeepLatent Reasoning (DLR)}, a latent-space bidirectional contrastive reinforcement learning framework. This framework shifts the trial-and-error cost from expensive token-level full sequence generation to the continuous latent manifold. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight assistant model to efficiently sample $K$ reasoning chain encodings within the latent space. These encodings are filtered via a dual reward mechanism based on correctness and formatting; only high-value latent trajectories are fed into a \\textbf{frozen main model} for single-pass decoding. To maximize reasoning diversity while maintaining coherence, we design a contrastive learning objective to enable directed exploration within the latent space. Since the main model parameters remain frozen during optimization, this method mathematically eliminates catastrophic forgetting. Experiments demonstrate that under comparable GPU computational budgets, DLR achieves more stable training convergence, supports longer-horizon reasoning chains, and facilitates the sustainable accumulation of reasoning capabilities, providing a viable path toward reliable and scalable reinforcement learning for LLMs."}

The focus of this work is twofold: first, to compare the convergence properties of the network outputs under various scaling schemes as the network width and the number of training steps tend to infinity; and second, to provide precise control of the approximation error associated with each scaling regime. Previous work has shown convergence to ordinary differential equations with random initial conditions under inverse square root scaling in the network width. In this work, we shift the focus from convergence speed alone to a more comprehensive statistical characterization of the algorithm's output, with the goal of quantifying uncertainty in neural Actor Critic methods. Specifically, we study a general inverse polynomial scaling in the network width, with an exponent treated as a tunable hyperparameter taking values strictly between one half and one. We derive an asymptotic expansion of the network outputs, interpreted as statistical estimators, in order to clarify their structure. To leading order, we show that the variance decays as a power of the network width, with an exponent equal to one half minus the scaling parameter, implying improved statistical robustness as the scaling parameter approaches one. Numerical experiments support this behavior and further suggest faster convergence for this choice of scaling. Finally, our analysis yields concrete guidelines for selecting algorithmic hyperparameters, including learning rates and exploration rates, as functions of the network width and the scaling parameter, ensuring provably favorable statistical behavior."}

Instead of using a traditional static firewall approach, the DMAS agents communicate via a lightweight peer-to-peer protocol to cooperatively detect anomalous behavior across the IIoT network without sending data to a cloud infrastructure.

We address this gap by introducing TensorLens, a novel formulation that captures the entire transformer as a single, input-dependent linear operator expressed through a high-order attention-interaction tensor. This tensor jointly encodes attention, FFNs, activations, normalizations, and residual connections, offering a theoretically coherent and expressive linear representation of the model's computation.

Current federated learning (FL) methods fail in this regime, as they assume local clients possess aligned pairs or require sharing raw feature embeddings, which violates data sovereignty. We propose a novel framework to train a global multimodal transformer across decentralized nodes with disjoint modalities. We introduce a small public anchor set to align disjoint private manifolds. Using Gram matrices calculated from these public anchors, we enforce semantic alignment across modalities through centered kernel alignment without ever transmitting private samples, offering a mathematically superior privacy guarantee compared to prototype sharing. Further, we introduce a subspace-stabilized fine-tuning method to handle FL with huge transformer models. We strictly decouple domain-specific magnitude shifts from semantic direction, ensuring that nodes with varying sensor characteristics align geometrically to the global consensus. Lastly, we propose precision weighted averaging, where efficiently obtained uncertainty estimates are used to downweight uncertain nodes. This paper establishes the mathematical backbone for federated unpaired foundation models, enabling a global model to learn a unified representation of the world from fragmented, disjoint, and private data silos without requiring centralized storage or paired samples."}

Focusing on well-known image classification of increasing complexity, and across Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Vision Transformers, our initial results show that, despite architectural diversity, performance is largely invariant and learning dynamics consistently exhibit three regimes: unstable, learning, and overfitting. We further characterize the minimal learnable parameters required for stable learning, uncover distinct convergence and pruning phases, and quantify the effect of reduced numeric precision on trainable parameters. Aligning with intuition, the results confirm that deeper architectures are more resilient to pruning than shallower ones, with parameter redundancy as high as 60%, and quantization impacts models with fewer learnable parameters more severely and has a larger effect on harder image datasets. These findings provide actionable guidance for selecting compact, stable models under pruning and low-precision constraints in image classification."}

We further develop Attribute Privacy Enhancement (APE) to translate input-level invariance into an attribute-level privacy effect. In a controlled recommendation task where the decision depends primarily on a sensitive attribute, we show that RP expands the set of sensitive-attribute values compatible with a positive recommendation, expanding the inference interval accordingly. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that RP also mitigates model inversion attacks (MIAs) by masking fine-grained input-output dependence. Even at small noise levels ($σ=0.1$), RP reduces the attack success rate (ASR) from 73% to 4% with partial model performance degradation.

This work systematically investigates two questions: how do TSFMs behave under standard sampling-based inference scaling, and can controlled sampling diversity enhance performance? We first examine the properties of TSFMs under standard sampling often fail to adhere to scaling laws due to insufficient exploration of the solution space. Building on this, we then delve into diversified inference scaling via tailored time series perturbations to expand the generative distribution's support. We theoretically analyze the diversity-fidelity trade-off and derive a critical sample threshold for diversified sampling to outperform standard sampling. Extensive experiments across various TSFMs and datasets show proper diversified inference scaling yields substantial performance gains without parameter updates, establishing inference design as a critical, compute-efficient dimension of TSFM optimization. As an application, we propose RobustMSE, a rigorous metric to quantify the headroom performance of TSFM under a fixed budget. Overall, our findings clarify these factor interactions, enabling reliable performance via diverse large-scale inference time series in parallel environments without re-training TSFMs."}

In this regime, classical energy-based diagnostics and unconstrained learned representations are structurally insensitive, leading to delayed or unstable detection. We introduce GO-OSC, a geometry-aware representation learning framework for oscillatory time series that enforces a canonical and identifiable latent parameterization, enabling stable comparison and aggregation across short, unlabeled windows. Building on this representation, we define a family of invariant linear geometric probes that target degradation-relevant directions in latent space. We provide theoretical results showing that under early phase-only degradation, energy-based statistics have zero first-order detection power, whereas geometric probes achieve strictly positive sensitivity. Our analysis characterizes when and why linear probing fails under non-identifiable representations and shows how canonicalization restores statistical detectability. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real vibration datasets validate the theory, demonstrating earlier detection, improved data efficiency, and robustness to operating condition changes."}

With the rapid recent advance in soft and stretchable electronics for emerging human- and robot-interfacing applications, there is a surging need for high-performance dielectric elastomers. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop soft elastomers that simultaneously possess high dielectric constants (k, related to energy storage capacity) and low Young's moduli (E, related to mechanical flexibility). While some new elastomer designs have been reported in individual (mostly one-off) studies, almost no structured dataset is currently available for dielectric elastomers that systematically encompasses their molecular sequence, dielectric, and mechanical properties. Within this context, we curate a compact, high-quality dataset of acrylate-based dielectric elastomers, one of the most widely explored elastomer backbones due to its versatile chemistry and molecular design flexibility, by screening and aggregating experimental results from the literature over the past 10 years. Building on this dataset, we propose a multimodal learning framework that leverages large-scale pretrained polymer representations from graph- and sequence-based encoders. These pretrained embeddings transfer rich chemical and structural knowledge from vast polymer corpora, enabling accurate few-shot prediction of both dielectric and mechanical properties from molecular sequences. Our results represent a new paradigm for transferring knowledge from pretrained multimodal models to overcome severe data scarcity, which can be readily translated to other polymer backbones (e.g., silicones, urethanes) and thus accelerate data-efficient discovery of soft high-k dielectric elastomers.

We further benchmark four privacy-preserving approaches including differential privacy, machine unlearning, regularization, and preference alignment, evaluating their trade-offs between privacy and task performance.

When these systems fail, the problem is often not the language model itself, but that the nearest neighbors in the embedding space correspond to the wrong cases. Modern machine learning systems increasingly rely on fixed, high-dimensional embeddings produced by large pretrained models and sentence encoders. In real-world deployments, labels are scarce, domains shift over time, and retraining the base encoder is expensive or infeasible. As a result, downstream performance depends heavily on embedding geometry. Yet raw embeddings are often poorly aligned with the local neighborhood structure required by nearest-neighbor retrieval, similarity search, and lightweight classifiers that operate directly on embeddings. We propose PEARL (Prototype-Enhanced Aligned Representation Learning), a label-efficient approach that uses limited supervision to softly align embeddings toward class prototypes. The method reshapes local neighborhood geometry while preserving dimensionality and avoiding aggressive projection or collapse. Its aim is to bridge the gap between purely unsupervised post-processing, which offers limited and inconsistent gains, and fully supervised projections that require substantial labeled data. We evaluate PEARL under controlled label regimes ranging from extreme label scarcity to higher-label settings. In the label-scarce condition, PEARL substantially improves local neighborhood quality, yielding 25.7% gains over raw embeddings and more than 21.1% gains relative to strong unsupervised post-processing, precisely in the regime where similarity-based systems are most brittle."}

While the truth may be out there in observed trajectories, existing methods struggle to extract it without supervision. In this work, we propose Unsupervised Imitation Learning from Observation (UfO) that addresses all of these limitations. UfO learns a policy through a two-stage process, in which the agent first obtains an approximation of the teacher's true actions in the observed state transitions, and then refines the learned policy further by adjusting agent trajectories to closely align them with the teacher's. Experiments we conducted in five widely used environments show that UfO not only outperforms the teacher and all other ILfO methods but also displays the smallest standard deviation. This reduction in standard deviation indicates better generalisation in unseen scenarios."}

To address these challenges, we propose the Knowledge-Guided Causal Model Variational Autoencoder (KGCM-VAE) to quantify causal mechanisms between sea ice thickness and SSH. The proposed framework integrates a velocity modulation scheme in which smoothed velocity signals are dynamically amplified via a sigmoid function governed by SSH transitions to generate physically grounded causal treatments.

A key threat is the membership inference attack (MIA), which aims to determine whether a given sample was included in the model's training set. Existing MIAs for LLMs rely primarily on output confidence scores or embedding-based features, but these signals are often brittle, leading to limited attack success. We introduce AttenMIA, a new MIA framework that exploits self-attention patterns inside the transformer model to infer membership. Attention controls the information flow within the transformer, exposing different patterns for memorization that can be used to identify members of the dataset. Our method uses information from attention heads across layers and combines them with perturbation-based divergence metrics to train an effective MIA classifier. Using extensive experiments on open-source models including LLaMA-2, Pythia, and Opt models, we show that attention-based features consistently outperform baselines, particularly under the important low-false-positive metric (e.g., achieving up to 0.996 ROC AUC & 87.9% TPR@1%FPR on the WikiMIA-32 benchmark with Llama2-13b). We show that attention signals generalize across datasets and architectures, and provide a layer- and head-level analysis of where membership leakage is most pronounced. We also show that using AttenMIA to replace other membership inference attacks in a data extraction framework results in training data extraction attacks that outperform the state of the art.

Instead of forcing the model to memorize vast chemical data, our approach empowers the language model to interact with a sandbox for precise information retrieval. This externalization of knowledge allows a locally deployable small model to achieve superior performance with minimal inference costs. To enable small language models for agent-calling ability, we build an agentic trajectory construction pipeline and a comprehensive chemical-agent sandbox.

Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving distributed training framework for this purpuse. However, the data heterogeneity issue among IoT devices can significantly degrade the model performance and convergence speed in FL. Existing approaches limit in fixed client selection and aggregation on cloud server, making the privacy-preserving extraction of client-specific information during local training challenging. To this end, we propose Client-Centric Adaptation federated learning (FedCCA), an algorithm that optimally utilizes client-specific knowledge to learn a unique model for each client through selective adaptation, aiming to alleviate the influence of data heterogeneity. Specifically, FedCCA employs dynamic client selection and adaptive aggregation based on the additional client-specific encoder. To enhance multi-source knowledge transfer, we adopt an attention-based global aggregation strategy. We conducted extensive experiments on diverse datasets to assess the efficacy of FedCCA. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits a substantial performance advantage over competing baselines in addressing this specific problem."}

At the system level, this non-determinism arises from floating-point non-associativity combined with dynamic batching and GPU kernels whose reduction orders vary with batch size. A straightforward way to eliminate non-determinism is to disable dynamic batching during inference, but doing so severely degrades throughput. Another approach is to make kernels batch-invariant; however, this tightly couples determinism to kernel design, requiring new implementations. This coupling also imposes fixed runtime overheads, regardless of how much of the workload actually requires determinism.\n  Inspired by ideas from speculative decoding, we present LLM-42, a scheduling-based approach to enable determinism in LLM inference. Our key observation is that if a sequence is in a consistent state, the next emitted token is likely to be consistent even with dynamic batching. Moreover, most GPU kernels use shape-consistent reductions. Leveraging these insights, LLM-42 decodes tokens using a non-deterministic fast path and enforces determinism via a lightweight verify-rollback loop. The verifier replays candidate tokens under a fixed-shape reduction schedule, commits those that are guaranteed to be consistent across runs, and rolls back those violating determinism. LLM-42 mostly re-uses existing kernels unchanged and incurs overhead only in proportion to the traffic that requires determinism."}

This report presents a practical FP8 rollout stack for LLM RL, implemented in the veRL ecosystem with support for common training backends (e.g., FSDP/Megatron-LM) and inference engines (e.g., vLLM/SGLang). We (i) enable FP8 W8A8 linear-layer rollout using blockwise FP8 quantization, (ii) extend FP8 to KV-cache to remove long-context memory bottlenecks via per-step QKV scale recalibration, and (iii) mitigate mismatch using importance-sampling-based rollout correction (token-level TIS/MIS variants).

In this paper, we propose HeterCSI, a channel-adaptive pretraining framework that reconciles training efficiency with robust cross-scenario generalization via a new understanding of gradient dynamics in heterogeneous CSI pretraining. Our key insight reveals that CSI scale heterogeneity primarily causes destructive gradient interference, while scenario diversity actually promotes constructive gradient alignment when properly managed. Specifically, we formulate heterogeneous CSI batch construction as a partitioning optimization problem that minimizes zero-padding overhead while preserving scenario diversity. To solve this, we develop a scale-aware adaptive batching strategy that aligns CSI samples of similar scales, and design a double-masking mechanism to isolate valid signals from padding artifacts. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that HeterCSI establishes a generalized foundation model without scenario-specific finetuning, achieving superior average performance over full-shot baselines. Compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot benchmark WiFo, it reduces NMSE by 7.19 dB, 4.08 dB, and 5.27 dB for CSI reconstruction, time-domain, and frequency-domain prediction, respectively.

The problem of phase retrieval has a rich history, with a variety of applications such as optics, crystallography, heteroscedastic regression, astrophysics, etc. A major consideration in algorithms for phase retrieval is robustness against measurement errors. In recent breakthroughs in algorithmic robust statistics, efficient algorithms have been developed for several parameter estimation tasks such as mean estimation, covariance estimation, robust principal component analysis (PCA), etc. in the presence of heavy-tailed noise and adversarial corruptions. In this paper, we study efficient algorithms for robust phase retrieval with heavy-tailed noise when a constant fraction of both the measurements $y_i$ and the sensing vectors $a_i$ may be arbitrarily adversarially corrupted. For this problem, Buna and Rebeschini (AISTATS 2025) very recently gave an exponential time algorithm with sample complexity $O(n \\log n)$.

Here, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art probabilistic skill requires neither intricate architectural constraints nor specialized training heuristics. We introduce a scalable framework for learning multi-scale atmospheric dynamics by combining a directly downsampled latent space with a history-conditioned local projector that resolves high-resolution physics. We find that our framework design is robust to the choice of probabilistic estimator, seamlessly supporting stochastic interpolants, diffusion models, and CRPS-based ensemble training. Validated against the Integrated Forecasting System and the deep learning probabilistic model GenCast, our framework achieves statistically significant improvements on most of the variables. These results suggest scaling a general-purpose model is sufficient for state-of-the-art medium-range prediction, eliminating the need for tailored training recipes and proving effective across the full spectrum of probabilistic frameworks."}

However, current pretraining approaches either constrain inputs to fixed dimensions or isolate training by scale, limiting the generalization and scalability of wireless foundation models. In this paper, we propose HeterCSI, a channel-adaptive pretraining framework that reconciles training efficiency with robust cross-scenario generalization via a new understanding of gradient dynamics in heterogeneous CSI pretraining. Our key insight reveals that CSI scale heterogeneity primarily causes destructive gradient interference, while scenario diversity actually promotes constructive gradient alignment when properly managed. Specifically, we formulate heterogeneous CSI batch construction as a partitioning optimization problem that minimizes zero-padding overhead while preserving scenario diversity. To solve this, we develop a scale-aware adaptive batching strategy that aligns CSI samples of similar scales, and design a double-masking mechanism to isolate valid signals from padding artifacts. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that HeterCSI establishes a generalized foundation model without scenario-specific finetuning, achieving superior average performance over full-shot baselines. Compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot benchmark WiFo, it reduces NMSE by 7.19 dB, 4.08 dB, and 5.27 dB for CSI reconstruction, time-domain, and frequency-domain prediction, respectively. The proposed HeterCSI framework also reduces training latency by 53% compared to existing approaches while improving generalization performance by 1.53 dB on average."}

Both modalities are used jointly to enable OODD in the drone remote identification (RID) task.

The dense-packed zone height is an important performance and safety indicator but it is often expensive and impractical to measure due to optical limitations. We propose to estimate phase heights using only inexpensive volume flow measurements. To this end, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is first pretrained on synthetic data and physics equations derived from a low-fidelity (approximate) mechanistic model to reduce the need for extensive experimental data. While the mechanistic model is used to generate synthetic training data, only volume balance equations are used in the PINN, since the integration of submodels describing droplet coalescence and sedimentation into the PINN would be computationally prohibitive. The pretrained PINN is then fine-tuned with scarce experimental data to capture the actual dynamics of the separator. We then employ the differentiable PINN as a predictive model in an Extended Kalman Filter inspired state estimation framework, enabling the phase heights to be tracked and updated from flow-rate measurements. We first test the two-stage trained PINN by forward simulation from a known initial state against the mechanistic model and a non-pretrained PINN. We then evaluate phase height estimation performance with the filter, comparing the two-stage trained PINN with a two-stage trained purely data-driven neural network. All model types are trained and evaluated using ensembles to account for model parameter uncertainty. In all evaluations, the two-stage trained PINN yields the most accurate phase-height estimates."}

In this paper, we explore model-level explanation techniques for deep graph learning models, aiming to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the models' overall decision-making processes and underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we address the problem of counterfactual explanations for deep graph learning models by introducing a generative model-level counterfactual explanation approach called GCFX, which is based on deep graph generation. This approach generates a set of high-quality counterfactual explanations that reflect the model's global predictive behavior by leveraging an enhanced deep graph generation framework and a global summarization algorithm. GCFX features an architecture that combines dual encoders, structure-aware taggers, and Message Passing Neural Network decoders, enabling it to accurately learn the true latent distribution of input data and generate high-quality, closely related counterfactual examples. Subsequently, a global counterfactual summarization algorithm selects the most representative and comprehensive explanations from numerous candidate counterfactuals, providing broad insights into the model's global predictive patterns. Experiments on a synthetic dataset and several real-world datasets demonstrate that GCFX outperforms existing methods in terms of counterfactual validity and coverage while maintaining low explanation costs, thereby offering crucial support for enhancing the practicality and trustworthiness of global counterfactual explanations."}

In this $O(L^{3/2})$ instantiation, the first step performs $O(L^{3/2})$ span-search to select relevant spans of the sequence, and the second step applies $O(L^{3/2})$ span-attention (standard attention restricted to the selected spans). In an upscaled $O(L^{1.54})$ configuration for robustness, we achieve an average decoding throughput of 114 tokens/sec at 1M context length and 80 tokens/sec at 10M context in our implementation on a modified 30B hybrid MoE model on a single B200 GPU. With limited training, we also obtain strong performance on the NIAH (Needle In A Haystack) task up to 256K context length, demonstrating that the routed span selection is learnable end-to-end. This paper emphasizes architectural formulation, scaling analysis, and systems feasibility, and presents initial validation; comprehensive quality evaluations across diverse long-context tasks are left to future work."}

Our framework provides two complementary algorithms: a frequentist variant that avoids explicit inversion of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) via structured approximations, and a Bayesian variant based on a Regularized-Kalman formulation that eliminates the need for FIM inversion entirely. We establish convergence guarantees for GRNG, showing that gradient regularization improves stability and enables convergence to global minima.

Designing effective adaptation strategies is challenging due to the long-term, sequential nature of infrastructure investments, deep uncertainty, and complex cross-sector interactions. We propose a generic decision-support framework that couples an integrated assessment model (IAM) with reinforcement learning (RL) to learn adaptive, multi-decade investment pathways under uncertainty. The framework combines long-term climate projections (e.g., IPCC scenario pathways) with models that map projected extreme-weather drivers (e.g. rain) into hazard likelihoods (e.g. flooding), propagate hazards into urban infrastructure impacts (e.g. transport disruption), and value direct and indirect consequences for service performance and societal costs. Embedded in a reinforcement-learning loop, it learns adaptive climate adaptation policies that trade off investment and maintenance expenditures against avoided impacts. In collaboration with Copenhagen Municipality, we demonstrate the approach on pluvial flooding in the inner city for the horizon of 2024 to 2100. The learned strategies yield coordinated spatial-temporal pathways and improved robustness relative to conventional optimization baselines, namely inaction and random action, illustrating the framework's transferability to other hazards and cities."}

However, their complex internal architectures and lack of transparency make it difficult to explain their decisions, resulting in opaque models that users find hard to understand and trust. In this paper, we explore model-level explanation techniques for deep graph learning models, aiming to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the models' overall decision-making processes and underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we address the problem of counterfactual explanations for deep graph learning models by introducing a generative model-level counterfactual explanation approach called GCFX, which is based on deep graph generation. This approach generates a set of high-quality counterfactual explanations that reflect the model's global predictive behavior by leveraging an enhanced deep graph generation framework and a global summarization algorithm. GCFX features an architecture that combines dual encoders, structure-aware taggers, and Message Passing Neural Network decoders, enabling it to accurately learn the true latent distribution of input data and generate high-quality, closely related counterfactual examples. Subsequently, a global counterfactual summarization algorithm selects the most representative and comprehensive explanations from numerous candidate counterfactuals, providing broad insights into the model's global predictive patterns. Experiments on a synthetic dataset and several real-world datasets demonstrate that GCFX outperforms existing methods in terms of counterfactual validity and coverage while maintaining low explanation costs, thereby offering crucial support for enhancing the practicality and trustworthiness of global counterfactual explanations."}

While prior methods have addressed action oscillations via architectural or loss-based methods, the latter typically depend on heuristic or synthetic definitions of state similarity to promote action consistency, which often fail to accurately reflect the underlying system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel loss-based method by introducing a transition-induced similar state. The transition-induced similar state is defined as the distribution of next states transitioned from the previous state. Since it utilizes only environmental feedback and actually collected data, it better captures system dynamics. Building upon this foundation, we introduce Action Smoothing by Aligning Actions with Predictions from Preceding States (ASAP), an action smoothing method that effectively mitigates action oscillations. ASAP enforces action smoothness by aligning the actions with those taken in transition-induced similar states and by penalizing second-order differences to suppress high-frequency oscillations. Experiments in Gymnasium and Isaac-Lab environments demonstrate that ASAP yields smoother control and improved policy performance over existing methods."}

This overlooks a common real-world scenario where data to be forgotten, such as a user's activity records, follows a long-tailed distribution. Our work is the first to investigate this critical research gap. We find that in such long-tailed settings, existing methods suffer from two key issues: \\textit{Heterogeneous Unlearning Deviation} and \\textit{Skewed Unlearning Deviation}. To address these challenges, we propose FaLW, a plug-and-play, instance-wise dynamic loss reweighting method. FaLW innovatively assesses the unlearning state of each sample by comparing its predictive probability to the distribution of unseen data from the same class. Based on this, it uses a forgetting-aware reweighting scheme, modulated by a balancing factor, to adaptively adjust the unlearning intensity for each sample. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaLW achieves superior performance. Code is available at \\textbf{Supplementary Material}."}

Model-guided medicine requires representations that capture disease dynamics while remaining transparent and task agnostic, whereas most clinical prediction models are optimised for a single task. Representation learning facilitates learning embeddings that generalise across downstream tasks, and recurrent architectures are well-suited for modelling temporal structure in observational clinical data. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we study patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and compare three recurrent architectures: a vanilla LSTM, an attention-augmented LSTM, and a time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM). All models are trained both as embedding models and as direct end-to-end predictors. Embedding quality is evaluated via CKD stage clustering and in-ICU mortality prediction. The T-LSTM produces more structured embeddings, achieving a lower Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI = 9.91) and higher CKD stage classification accuracy (0.74) than the vanilla LSTM (DBI = 15.85, accuracy = 0.63) and attention-augmented LSTM (DBI = 20.72, accuracy = 0.67). For in-ICU mortality prediction, embedding models consistently outperform end-to-end predictors, improving accuracy from 0.72-0.75 to 0.82-0.83, which indicates that learning embeddings as an intermediate step is more effective than direct end-to-end learning."}

This review critically examines the main categories of algorithmic solutions designed to address this conflict. We survey and benchmark methods that relax the exchangeability assumption, those that redefine the data unit to be a collection of independent time series, approaches that explicitly model the dynamics of the prediction residuals, and online learning algorithms that adapt to distribution shifts to maintain long-run coverage. By synthesizing these approaches, we highlight computational efficiency and practical performance on real-world data."}

Many existing models incorporate the simulation mesh as an additional input, thereby reducing prediction errors. However, generating a simulation mesh for new geometries is computationally costly. In contrast, mesh-free methods, which do not rely on the simulation mesh, typically incur higher errors. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce SMART, a neural surrogate model that predicts physical quantities at arbitrary query locations using only a point-cloud representation of the geometry, without requiring access to the simulation mesh. The geometry and simulation parameters are encoded into a shared latent space that captures both structural and parametric characteristics of the physical field. A physics decoder then attends to the encoder's intermediate latent representations to map spatial queries to physical quantities. Through this cross-layer interaction, the model jointly updates latent geometric features and the evolving physical field. Extensive experiments show that SMART is competitive with and often outperforms existing methods that rely on the simulation mesh as input, demonstrating its capabilities for industry-level simulations."}

However, real-world preference data often comes from heterogeneous annotators with varying reliability; some accurate, some noisy, and some systematically adversarial. Existing PBRL methods either treat all feedback equally or attempt to filter out unreliable sources, but both approaches fail when faced with adversarial annotators who systematically provide incorrect preferences. We introduce TriTrust-PBRL (TTP), a unified framework that jointly learns a shared reward model and expert-specific trust parameters from multi-expert preference feedback. The key insight is that trust parameters naturally evolve during gradient-based optimization to be positive (trust), near zero (ignore), or negative (flip), enabling the model to automatically invert adversarial preferences and recover useful signal rather than merely discarding corrupted feedback. We provide theoretical analysis establishing identifiability guarantees and detailed gradient analysis that explains how expert separation emerges naturally during training without explicit supervision. Empirically, we evaluate TTP on four diverse domains spanning manipulation tasks (MetaWorld) and locomotion (DM Control) under various corruption scenarios.

We propose a semi-supervised framework that learns NMR chemical shifts from millions of literature-extracted spectra without explicit atom-level assignments, integrating a small amount of labeled data with large-scale unassigned spectra. We formulate chemical shift prediction from literature spectra as a permutation-invariant set supervision problem, and show that under commonly satisfied conditions on the loss function, optimal bipartite matching reduces to a sorting-based loss, enabling stable large-scale semi-supervised training beyond traditional curated datasets. Our models achieve substantially improved accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art methods and exhibit stronger generalization on significantly larger and more diverse molecular datasets. Moreover, by incorporating solvent information at scale, our approach captures systematic solvent effects across common NMR solvents for the first time.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Hallucination Risk Bound, a unified theoretical framework that formally decomposes hallucination risk into data-driven and reasoning-driven components, linked respectively to training-time mismatches and inference-time instabilities. This provides a principled foundation for analyzing how hallucinations emerge and evolve. Building on this foundation, we introduce HalluGuard, an NTK-based score that leverages the induced geometry and captured representations of the NTK to jointly identify data-driven and reasoning-driven hallucinations. We evaluate HalluGuard on 10 diverse benchmarks, 11 competitive baselines, and 9 popular LLM backbones, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in detecting diverse forms of LLM hallucinations."}

Although CLIP-based losses effectively align modalities at the semantic level, the resulting latent spaces often remain only partially shared, revealing a structural mismatch known as the modality gap. While the necessity of addressing this phenomenon remains debated, particularly given its limited impact on instance-wise tasks (e.g., retrieval), we prove that its influence is instead strongly pronounced in group-level tasks (e.g., clustering). To support this claim, we introduce a novel method designed to consistently reduce this discrepancy in two-modal settings, with a straightforward extension to the general $n$-modal case. Through our extensive evaluation, we demonstrate our novel insight: while reducing the gap provides only marginal or inconsistent improvements in traditional instance-wise tasks, it significantly enhances group-wise tasks. These findings may reshape our understanding of the modality gap, highlighting its key role in improving performance on tasks requiring semantic grouping."}

In recent times, several deployed systems have explored the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated judges for this task while their inherent biases prevent direct use for metric estimation. We present a statistical framework extending Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) that combines minimal human annotations with LLM judgments to produce reliable estimates of metrics which require sub-instance annotations. Our method requires as few as 100 human-annotated queries and 10,000 unlabeled examples, reducing annotation requirements significantly compared to traditional approaches. We formulate our proposed framework (PRECISE) for inference of relevance uplift for an LLM-based query reformulation application, extending PPI to sub-instance annotations at the query-document level. By reformulating the metric-integration space, we reduced the computational complexity from O(2^|C|) to O(2^K), where |C| represents corpus size (in order of millions). Detailed experiments across prominent retrieval datasets demonstrate that our method reduces the variance of estimates for the business-critical Precision@K metric, while effectively correcting for LLM bias in low-resource settings."}

We provide non-asymptotic operator-norm guarantees under sub-Gaussian inputs. We also show that without such calibration, recovery can fail by an $Ω(1)$ factor. The proposed method is practical (a \"set target-noise variance to $n$\" rule) and robust (variance $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ suffices to recover $Σ$ up to scale). Applications include preconditioning for faster optimisation, adversarial risk estimation, and gradient-only training, for example, in distributed systems.

On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for driving improvement. We find that natural solutions to remedy this exploration problem from classical RL, such as entropy bonuses, more permissive clipping of the importance ratio, or direct optimization of pass@k objectives, do not resolve this issue and often destabilize optimization without improving solvability. A natural alternative is to leverage transfer from easier problems. However, we show that mixing easy and hard problems during RL training is counterproductive due to ray interference, where optimization focuses on already-solvable problems in a way that actively inhibits progress on harder ones. To address this challenge, we introduce Privileged On-Policy Exploration (POPE), an approach that leverages human- or other oracle solutions as privileged information to guide exploration on hard problems, unlike methods that use oracle solutions as training targets (e.g., off-policy RL methods or warmstarting from SFT). POPE augments hard problems with prefixes of oracle solutions, enabling RL to obtain non-zero rewards during guided rollouts. Crucially, the resulting behaviors transfer back to the original, unguided problems through a synergy between instruction-following and reasoning. Empirically, POPE expands the set of solvable problems and substantially improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks."}

The proposed approach learns a continuous set of Pareto-optimal policies that capture the trade-offs among three conflicting objectives: safety, quantified in terms of collisions and successful completion; energy efficiency and time efficiency, quantified using energy cost and driver cost, respectively.

To bootstrap more efficient RL, we consider reusing old sampling FLOPs (from prior inference or RL training) in the form of off-policy traces. Standard off-policy methods supervise against off-policy data, causing instabilities during RL optimization. We introduce PrefixRL, where we condition on the prefix of successful off-policy traces and run on-policy RL to complete them, side-stepping off-policy instabilities. PrefixRL boosts the learning signal on hard problems by modulating the difficulty of the problem through the off-policy prefix length. We prove that the PrefixRL objective is not only consistent with the standard RL objective but also more sample efficient. Empirically, we discover back-generalization: training only on prefixed problems generalizes to out-of-distribution unprefixed performance, with learned strategies often differing from those in the prefix. In our experiments, we source the off-policy traces by rejection sampling with the base model, creating a self-improvement loop. On hard reasoning problems, PrefixRL reaches the same training reward 2x faster than the strongest baseline (SFT on off-policy data then RL), even after accounting for the compute spent on the initial rejection sampling, and increases the final reward by 3x. The gains transfer to held-out benchmarks, and PrefixRL is still effective when off-policy traces are derived from a different model family, validating its flexibility in practical settings."}

Designing effective adaptation strategies is challenging due to the long-term, sequential nature of infrastructure investments, deep uncertainty, and complex cross-sector interactions. We propose a generic decision-support framework that couples an integrated assessment model (IAM) with reinforcement learning (RL) to learn adaptive, multi-decade investment pathways under uncertainty. The framework combines long-term climate projections (e.g., IPCC scenario pathways) with models that map projected extreme-weather drivers (e.g. rain) into hazard likelihoods (e.g. flooding), propagate hazards into urban infrastructure impacts (e.g. transport disruption), and value direct and indirect consequences for service performance and societal costs. Embedded in a reinforcement-learning loop, it learns adaptive climate adaptation policies that trade off investment and maintenance expenditures against avoided impacts. In collaboration with Copenhagen Municipality, we demonstrate the approach on pluvial flooding in the inner city for the horizon of 2024 to 2100. The learned strategies yield coordinated spatial-temporal pathways and improved robustness relative to conventional optimization baselines, namely inaction and random action, illustrating the framework's transferability to other hazards and cities."}

Standard approaches, such as GSEA, rely on predefined phenotypic labels and pairwise comparisons, which limits their applicability in unsupervised settings. Existing unsupervised extensions, including single-sample methods, provide pathway-level summaries but primarily capture linear relationships and do not explicitly model gene-pathway associations. More recently, deep learning models have been explored to capture non-linear transcriptomic structure. However, their interpretation has typically relied on generic explainable AI (XAI) techniques designed for feature-level attribution. As these methods are not designed for pathway-level interpretation in unsupervised transcriptomic analyses, their effectiveness in this setting remains limited.\n  Results: To bridge this gap, we introduce LaCoGSEA (Latent Correlation GSEA), an unsupervised framework that integrates deep representation learning with robust pathway statistics. LaCoGSEA employs an autoencoder to capture non-linear manifolds and proposes a global gene-latent correlation metric as a proxy for differential expression, generating dense gene rankings without prior labels. We demonstrate that LaCoGSEA offers three key advantages: (i) it achieves improved clustering performance in distinguishing cancer subtypes compared to existing unsupervised baselines; (ii) it recovers a broader range of biologically meaningful pathways at higher ranks compared with linear dimensionality reduction and gradient-based XAI methods; and (iii) it maintains high robustness and consistency across varying experimental protocols and dataset sizes.

Here, we introduce and validate a fundamentally different paradigm of Physics-Informed Uncertainty, where the degree to which a model's prediction violates fundamental physical laws serves as a computationally-cheap and effective proxy for predictive uncertainty. By integrating physics-informed uncertainty into a multi-fidelity uncertainty-aware optimization workflow to design complex frequency-selective surfaces within the 20 - 30 GHz range, we increase the success rate of finding performant solutions from less than 10% to over 50%, while simultaneously reducing computational cost by an order of magnitude compared to the sole use of a high-fidelity solver. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating uncertainty quantification in machine-learning-driven inverse design for high-dimensional problems, and establish physics-informed uncertainty as a viable alternative to quantifying uncertainty in surrogate models for physical systems, thereby setting the stage for autonomous scientific discovery systems that can efficiently and robustly explore and evaluate candidate designs."}

Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we study patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and compare three recurrent architectures: a vanilla LSTM, an attention-augmented LSTM, and a time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM). All models are trained both as embedding models and as direct end-to-end predictors. Embedding quality is evaluated via CKD stage clustering and in-ICU mortality prediction. The T-LSTM produces more structured embeddings, achieving a lower Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI = 9.91) and higher CKD stage classification accuracy (0.74) than the vanilla LSTM (DBI = 15.85, accuracy = 0.63) and attention-augmented LSTM (DBI = 20.72, accuracy = 0.67).

Here, we present a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of catastrophic forgetting in transformer-based LLMs during sequential fine-tuning. Through systematic experiments across multiple model scales (109B to 400B total parameters) and task sequences, we identify three primary mechanisms driving forgetting: gradient interference in attention weights, representational drift in intermediate layers, and loss landscape flattening. We demonstrate that forgetting severity correlates strongly with task similarity (Pearson r = 0.87) and gradient alignment metrics. Our analysis reveals that approximately 15 to 23 percent of attention heads undergo severe disruption during fine-tuning, with lower layers showing greater susceptibility. These findings establish mechanistic foundations for developing targeted mitigation strategies in continual learning systems."}

Many existing models incorporate the simulation mesh as an additional input, thereby reducing prediction errors. However, generating a simulation mesh for new geometries is computationally costly. In contrast, mesh-free methods, which do not rely on the simulation mesh, typically incur higher errors. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce SMART, a neural surrogate model that predicts physical quantities at arbitrary query locations using only a point-cloud representation of the geometry, without requiring access to the simulation mesh. The geometry and simulation parameters are encoded into a shared latent space that captures both structural and parametric characteristics of the physical field. A physics decoder then attends to the encoder's intermediate latent representations to map spatial queries to physical quantities. Through this cross-layer interaction, the model jointly updates latent geometric features and the evolving physical field. Extensive experiments show that SMART is competitive with and often outperforms existing methods that rely on the simulation mesh as input, demonstrating its capabilities for industry-level simulations."}

In this work, we introduce Riemannian AmbientFlow, a framework for simultaneously learning a probabilistic generative model and the underlying, nonlinear data manifold directly from corrupted observations. Building on the variational inference framework of AmbientFlow, our approach incorporates data-driven Riemannian geometry induced by normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of manifold structure through pullback metrics and Riemannian Autoencoders. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that, under appropriate geometric regularization and measurement conditions, the learned model recovers the underlying data distribution up to a controllable error and yields a smooth, bi-Lipschitz manifold parametrization. We further show that the resulting smooth decoder can serve as a principled generative prior for inverse problems with recovery guarantees.

However, on-policy distillation typically requires a separate, often larger, teacher LLM and does not explicitly leverage ground-truth solutions available in reasoning datasets. Inspired by the intuition that a sufficiently capable LLM can rationalize external privileged reasoning traces and teach its weaker self (i.e., the version without access to privileged information), we introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), a framework where a single model acts as both teacher and student by conditioning on different contexts. The teacher policy conditions on privileged information (e.g., verified reasoning traces) while the student policy sees only the question; training minimizes the per-token divergence between these distributions over the student's own rollouts.

We introduce TriTrust-PBRL (TTP), a unified framework that jointly learns a shared reward model and expert-specific trust parameters from multi-expert preference feedback. The key insight is that trust parameters naturally evolve during gradient-based optimization to be positive (trust), near zero (ignore), or negative (flip), enabling the model to automatically invert adversarial preferences and recover useful signal rather than merely discarding corrupted feedback. We provide theoretical analysis establishing identifiability guarantees and detailed gradient analysis that explains how expert separation emerges naturally during training without explicit supervision. Empirically, we evaluate TTP on four diverse domains spanning manipulation tasks (MetaWorld) and locomotion (DM Control) under various corruption scenarios. TTP achieves state-of-the-art robustness, maintaining near-oracle performance under adversarial corruption while standard PBRL methods fail catastrophically. Notably, TTP outperforms existing baselines by successfully learning from mixed expert pools containing both reliable and adversarial annotators, all while requiring no expert features beyond identification indices and integrating seamlessly with existing PBRL pipelines."}

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Hallucination Risk Bound, a unified theoretical framework that formally decomposes hallucination risk into data-driven and reasoning-driven components, linked respectively to training-time mismatches and inference-time instabilities. This provides a principled foundation for analyzing how hallucinations emerge and evolve. Building on this foundation, we introduce HalluGuard, an NTK-based score that leverages the induced geometry and captured representations of the NTK to jointly identify data-driven and reasoning-driven hallucinations.

We extend the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) approach to generate contextual principles from human preference annotation data by leveraging human-provided \\textit{reasons} for their preferences. We supplement these contextual principles with general principles surfaced from user statements of \\textit{values} regarding AI.

Our method requires as few as 100 human-annotated queries and 10,000 unlabeled examples, reducing annotation requirements significantly compared to traditional approaches. We formulate our proposed framework (PRECISE) for inference of relevance uplift for an LLM-based query reformulation application, extending PPI to sub-instance annotations at the query-document level. By reformulating the metric-integration space, we reduced the computational complexity from O(2^|C|) to O(2^K), where |C| represents corpus size (in order of millions).

Reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large reasoning models stall on datasets with low initial success rates, and thus little training signal. We investigate a fundamental question: Can a pretrained LLM leverage latent knowledge to generate an automated curriculum for problems it cannot solve? To explore this, we design SOAR: A self-improvement framework designed to surface these pedagogical signals through meta-RL. A teacher copy of the model proposes synthetic problems for a student copy, and is rewarded with its improvement on a small subset of hard problems. Critically, SOAR grounds the curriculum in measured student progress rather than intrinsic proxy rewards. Our study on the hardest subsets of mathematical benchmarks (0/128 success) reveals three core findings. First, we show that it is possible to realize bi-level meta-RL that unlocks learning under sparse, binary rewards by sharpening a latent capacity of pretrained models to generate useful stepping stones. Second, grounded rewards outperform intrinsic reward schemes used in prior LLM self-play, reliably avoiding the instability and diversity collapse modes they typically exhibit. Third, analyzing the generated questions reveals that structural quality and well-posedness are more critical for learning progress than solution correctness. Our results suggest that the ability to generate useful stepping stones does not require the preexisting ability to actually solve the hard problems, paving a principled path to escape reasoning plateaus without additional curated data."}

On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for driving improvement. We find that natural solutions to remedy this exploration problem from classical RL, such as entropy bonuses, more permissive clipping of the importance ratio, or direct optimization of pass@k objectives, do not resolve this issue and often destabilize optimization without improving solvability. A natural alternative is to leverage transfer from easier problems. However, we show that mixing easy and hard problems during RL training is counterproductive due to ray interference, where optimization focuses on already-solvable problems in a way that actively inhibits progress on harder ones. To address this challenge, we introduce Privileged On-Policy Exploration (POPE), an approach that leverages human- or other oracle solutions as privileged information to guide exploration on hard problems, unlike methods that use oracle solutions as training targets (e.g., off-policy RL methods or warmstarting from SFT). POPE augments hard problems with prefixes of oracle solutions, enabling RL to obtain non-zero rewards during guided rollouts. Crucially, the resulting behaviors transfer back to the original, unguided problems through a synergy between instruction-following and reasoning. Empirically, POPE expands the set of solvable problems and substantially improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks."}

The proposed approach learns a continuous set of Pareto-optimal policies that capture the trade-offs among three conflicting objectives: safety, quantified in terms of collisions and successful completion; energy efficiency and time efficiency, quantified using energy cost and driver cost, respectively.

To bootstrap more efficient RL, we consider reusing old sampling FLOPs (from prior inference or RL training) in the form of off-policy traces. Standard off-policy methods supervise against off-policy data, causing instabilities during RL optimization. We introduce PrefixRL, where we condition on the prefix of successful off-policy traces and run on-policy RL to complete them, side-stepping off-policy instabilities. PrefixRL boosts the learning signal on hard problems by modulating the difficulty of the problem through the off-policy prefix length. We prove that the PrefixRL objective is not only consistent with the standard RL objective but also more sample efficient. Empirically, we discover back-generalization: training only on prefixed problems generalizes to out-of-distribution unprefixed performance, with learned strategies often differing from those in the prefix. In our experiments, we source the off-policy traces by rejection sampling with the base model, creating a self-improvement loop. On hard reasoning problems, PrefixRL reaches the same training reward 2x faster than the strongest baseline (SFT on off-policy data then RL), even after accounting for the compute spent on the initial rejection sampling, and increases the final reward by 3x. The gains transfer to held-out benchmarks, and PrefixRL is still effective when off-policy traces are derived from a different model family, validating its flexibility in practical settings."}

The graybox framework integrates a physics-based system model with a data-driven description of experimental imperfections, achieving higher fidelity than purely analytical (whitebox) approaches while requiring fewer training resources than fully deep-learning models. We experimentally validate the method on the task of estimating a static magnetic field using a single-spin quantum sensor, performing Bayesian inference with a graybox model trained on prior experimental data.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, we deploy it for Directed Energy Deposition process to print GRCop--42, a high-performance copper--chromium--niobium alloy developed by NASA for aerospace applications. Within three months, our approach yielded multiple defect-free outputs across a range of laser powers dramatically reducing time to result and resource expenditure compared to several months of manual experimentation by domain scientists with no success. By enabling high-quality GRCop--42 fabrication on readily available infrared laser platforms for the first time, we democratize access to this critical alloy, paving the way for cost-effective, decentralized production for aerospace applications."}

By transforming data from a scarce resource into a controllable asset, LLMs mitigate the bottlenecks imposed by the acquisition costs of real-world data for model training, evaluation, and system iteration. However, ensuring the high quality of LLM-generated synthetic data remains a critical challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on generation methodologies, with limited direct attention to the quality of the resulting data. Furthermore, most studies are restricted to single modalities, lacking a unified perspective across different data types. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{LLM Data Auditor framework}. In this framework, we first describe how LLMs are utilized to generate data across six distinct modalities. More importantly, we systematically categorize intrinsic metrics for evaluating synthetic data from two dimensions: quality and trustworthiness. This approach shifts the focus from extrinsic evaluation, which relies on downstream task performance, to the inherent properties of the data itself. Using this evaluation system, we analyze the experimental evaluations of representative generation methods for each modality and identify substantial deficiencies in current evaluation practices. Based on these findings, we offer concrete recommendations for the community to improve the evaluation of data generation. Finally, the framework outlines methodologies for the practical application of synthetic data across different modalities."}

Traditional predictive models often struggle to generalize across heterogeneous datasets and complex physiological patterns.

This approach combines the representational power of deep networks with the interpretability and efficiency of traditional models. Experiments on two publicly available Kaggle datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance, reaching 82.30 percent accuracy on Dataset I and 97.10 percent on Dataset II, with consistent gains in precision, recall, and F1-score. These findings underscore the robustness and clinical potential of hybrid AI frameworks for predicting cardiovascular disease and facilitating early intervention.

These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.\n  We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1."}

This principle appears under many names -- rejection sampling with SFT, goal-conditioned RL, Decision Transformers -- yet what optimization problem it solves, if any, has remained unclear. We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a $χ^2$ divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all. We apply our theory to the common practice of return thresholding, showing this can amplify improvement, but at the cost of potential misalignment with the true objective."}

In this work, we investigate the challenge of agentic post-training when the eventual test domains are unknown. Specifically, we analyze which properties of reinforcement learning (RL) environments and modeling choices have the greatest influence on out-of-domain performance. First, we identify two environment axes that strongly correlate with cross-domain generalization: (i) state information richness, i.e., the amount of information for the agent to process from the state, and (ii) planning complexity, estimated via goal reachability and trajectory length under a base policy. Notably, domain realism and text-level similarity are not the primary factors; for instance, the simple grid-world domain Sokoban leads to even stronger generalization in SciWorld than the more realistic ALFWorld. Motivated by these findings, we further show that increasing state information richness alone can already effectively improve cross-domain robustness. We propose a randomization technique, which is low-overhead and broadly applicable: add small amounts of distractive goal-irrelevant features to the state to make it richer without altering the task. Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization."}

To address these limitations, we propose Think-Augmented Function Calling (TAFC), a novel framework that enhances function calling accuracy through explicit reasoning at both function and parameter levels. Our method introduces a universal \"think\" parameter augmentation that enables models to articulate their decision-making process, with dynamic optimization for parameter descriptions to improve reasoning quality. For complex parameters, TAFC automatically triggers granular reasoning based on complexity scoring, ensuring appropriate justification for critical decisions. Additionally, we propose reasoning-guided optimization to align generated reasoning with human expectations. TAFC requires no architectural modifications to existing LLMs while maintaining full API compatibility. Evaluation on ToolBench across proprietary and open-source models demonstrates significant improvements in parameter generation accuracy and reasoning coherence for multi-parameter functions, while providing enhanced interpretability for debugging AI agent behaviors."}

In this paper, we demonstrate that expensive online reinforcement learning is not all you need to build powerful research agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully open-source suite designed for effective offline training. Our core contributions include DeepForge, a ready-to-use task synthesis framework that generates large-scale research queries without heavy preprocessing; and a curated collection of 66k QA pairs, 33k SFT trajectories, and 21k DPO pairs.

In this work, we analyze how stabilizing training dynamics affects the induced generation distribution. We show that under standard maximum likelihood training, stable parameter trajectories lead stationary solutions to approximately minimize the forward KL divergence to the empirical distribution, while implicitly reducing generative entropy. As a consequence, the learned model can concentrate probability mass on a limited subset of empirical modes, exhibiting systematic degeneration despite smooth loss convergence. We empirically validate this effect using a controlled feedback-based training framework that stabilizes internal generation statistics, observing consistent low-entropy outputs and repetitive behavior across architectures and random seeds. It indicates that optimization stability and generative expressivity are not inherently aligned, and that stability alone is an insufficient indicator of generative quality."}

One promising approach for improving LLM reasoning abilities involves translating problems into formal logic and using a logic solver. Although off-the-shelf logic solvers are in principle substantially more efficient than LLMs at logical reasoning, they assume that all relevant facts are provided in a question and are unable to deal with missing commonsense relations. In this work, we propose a novel method that uses feedback from the logic solver to augment a logic problem with commonsense relations provided by the LLM, in an iterative manner. This involves a search procedure through potential commonsense assumptions to maximize the chance of finding useful facts while keeping cost tractable. On a collection of pure-logical reasoning datasets, from which some commonsense information has been removed, our method consistently achieves considerable improvements over existing techniques, demonstrating the value in balancing neural and symbolic elements when working in human contexts."}

KernelSHAP approximates Shapley values by approximating the game as a linear function, which is fit using a small number of game evaluations for random feature subsets.\n  In this work, we extend KernelSHAP by approximating the game via higher degree polynomials, which capture non-linear interactions between features. Our resulting PolySHAP method yields empirically better Shapley value estimates for various benchmark datasets, and we prove that these estimates are consistent.\n  Moreover, we connect our approach to paired sampling (antithetic sampling), a ubiquitous modification to KernelSHAP that improves empirical accuracy. We prove that paired sampling outputs exactly the same Shapley value approximations as second-order PolySHAP, without ever fitting a degree 2 polynomial. To the best of our knowledge, this finding provides the first strong theoretical justification for the excellent practical performance of the paired sampling heuristic."}
