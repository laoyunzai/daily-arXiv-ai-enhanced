Abstract: Odd-parity magnetism has attracted significant interest for its unconventional spin splitting. However, a concrete microscopic route for its realization remains elusive. In this work, we propose van der Waals heterostructures of stripe antiferromagnets (sAFMs) as an ideal platform for electrically controllable $p$-wave magnetism. In the sAFM/metal/sAFM structure, the leading RKKY-type exchange interaction is canceled due to the symmetry of the stacking pattern. This exposes a higher-order biquadratic interaction as a dominant contribution that drives a filling-controlled transition from a collinear phase to an orthogonal $p$-wave configuration. The resulting $p$-wave phase exhibits a gate-tunable Edelstein response, which originates from magnetic symmetry breaking rather than conventional relativistic spin-momentum locking and remains robust even under substantial spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we propose material candidates for the realization of our theory. Our results establish van der Waals heterostructures as a practical platform for non-relativistic spintronics with electric control of odd-parity spin textures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对平面八顶点模型建立完整的计算复杂性分类，明确其配分函数在不同参数下的计算复杂度（P-time或#P-hard），并探索平面图上的高效算法新实例。

Method: 通过组合变换将平面八顶点模型转化为平面偶着色问题，再经全息变换映射到平面六顶点模型的可解案例；结合复分析中的Möbius变换、共形格点插值及分圆域理论进行证明。

Result: 1) 提出明确的复杂度分类准则；2) 发现#P-hard类中平面图仍高效计算的新模型（超越Kasteleyn的完美匹配计数算法）；3) 揭示八顶点模型与双Ising模型、复分析工具的非局部联系。

Conclusion: 该分类定理完整刻画了平面八顶点模型的计算复杂性边界，拓展了平面图上可解统计物理模型的范畴，并为相关领域（如量子计算、共形场论）提供了新工具和交叉视角。

Abstract: We prove a complete complexity classification theorem for the planar eight-vertex model. For every parameter setting in ${\mathbb C}$ for the eight-vertex model, the partition function is either (1) computable in P-time for every graph, or (2) \#P-hard for general graphs but computable in P-time for planar graphs, or (3) \#P-hard even for planar graphs. The classification has an explicit criterion. In (2), we discover new P-time computable eight-vertex models on planar graphs beyond Kasteleyn's algorithm for counting planar perfect matchings. They are obtained by a combinatorial transformation to the planar {\sc Even Coloring} problem followed by a holographic transformation to the tractable cases in the planar six-vertex model. In the process, we also encounter non-local connections between the planar eight vertex model and the bipartite Ising model, conformal lattice interpolation and Möbius transformation from complex analysis. The proof also makes use of cyclotomic fields.

Abstract: We present a stochastic framework for low-population dynamics in circulating-fuel reactors (CFRs) that captures delayed-neutron precursor (DNP) transport without delay terms. Starting from a modified point-kinetics model with two perfectly-mixed volumes, we derive equivalent discrete-event dynamics and an Itô stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. Two solvers are implemented: an analog Monte Carlo (AMC) engine and a semi-implicit Milstein SDE solver. Transient benchmarks demonstrate perfect agreement of AMC/SDE means with deterministic solutions, while revealing that the SDE approach underestimates DNP variances in selected regimes, potentially due to the neglect of DNP noise. We further recast reactivity loss due to precursor drift in this stochastic setting and show that its estimator is negatively biased. Overall, the developed framework provides a minimal yet representative model for CFR low-population kinetics. Future work will re-derive and test SDE noise terms and apply the framework to selected transient applications such as start-up analyses of CFRs.

TL;DR: Extends directed percolation model calculations to three-loop order using field-theoretic renormalization group, mapping most diagrams to existing results while developing new techniques for remaining novel ones, with full calculations still in progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve higher precision in studying directed percolation—a paradigmatic model for phase transitions—by extending perturbative calculations of the equation of state beyond previous two-loop approximations.

Method: Field-theoretic renormalization group approach with ε=4-d expansion; semi-analytic procedure mapping most three-loop Feynman diagrams to existing results, plus novel techniques for remaining diagrams; verification of prior two-loop results.

Result: Demonstrated that a large group of necessary three-loop diagrams can leverage existing results; developed calculation techniques for novel diagrams; verified existing two-loop results; full three-loop calculations remain ongoing.

Conclusion: This work provides methodological advancements and partial results for three-loop calculations in directed percolation, serving as an update on ongoing research toward completing the full three-loop analysis.

Abstract: In this work, we employ a field-theoretic renormalization group approach to study a paradigmatic model of directed percolation. We focus on the perturbative calculation of the equation of state, extending the analysis to the three-loop order in the expansion parameter $\varepsilon = 4-d$. We show that a large group of the necessary three-loop Feynman diagrams can be mapped onto already existing three-loop results, and develop a technique for the calculation of the remaining -- truly novel -- ones. The described semi-analytic procedure is further used to verify existing two-loop results. The main aim of this study is to provide an update on this ongoing work, as full three-loop calculations utilizing the described procedure are in progress.
