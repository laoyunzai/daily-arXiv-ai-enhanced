### [1] [Do LLMs Favor LLMs? Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20920)
*Vibhhu Sharma,Thorsten Joachims,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究发现，表面上LLM辅助评审对LLM辅助论文更宽容，但控制论文质量后发现，这实际上是因为LLM辅助评审普遍对低质量论文更宽松，且LLM辅助论文多集中于较弱投稿中，而非对LLM生成内容有特殊偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在学术写作和同行评审中的使用日益增多，需要系统分析LLM在整个评审流程中的使用情况，特别是LLM辅助评审是否会以不同方式评价LLM辅助论文的交互效应。

Method: 分析了来自ICLR、NeurIPS和ICML的超过12.5万篇论文-评审配对数据，考察LLM辅助论文与LLM辅助评审之间的交互作用；并通过完全LLM生成的评审和元评审进行补充验证。

Result: 1) 初始观察显示LLM辅助评审对LLM辅助论文更宽容；2) 控制论文质量后，该效应消失，表明LLM辅助评审普遍更宽松，且LLM辅助论文在较弱投稿中占比过高；3) 完全LLM生成评审存在严重评分压缩，无法区分论文质量；4) 人类使用LLM后显著降低了这种宽松倾向；5) LLM辅助元评审在同等评审分数下更易做出录用决定，而完全LLM生成元评审则更严格。

Conclusion: LLM辅助评审与LLM辅助论文之间的交互效应是虚假的，源于论文质量分布差异而非对LLM内容的特殊对待；元评审者并非简单将决策外包给LLM。这些发现为制定评审中LLM使用政策提供了重要依据，并揭示了LLM如何与现有决策过程交互。

Abstract: There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.

### [2] [The Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language: Official Guideline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20969)
*Alessandro Burigana,Francesco Fabiano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍EPDDL（认知规划领域定义语言），这是一种类似PDDL的表示语言，用于捕获动态认知逻辑（DEL）的完整语义，解决现有认知规划器因使用不同DEL片段和临时语言导致的碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有认知规划器使用不同的DEL片段和临时语言（甚至无标准语言），导致难以进行比较、重用和系统性基准测试开发。DEL的高表达能力使基于DEL的认知规划在理论和实践中都面临挑战。

Method: 1. 开发抽象事件模型作为认知动作的新表示方法；2. 基于DEL和抽象事件模型，形式化定义EPDDL的语法和语义；3. 识别适合当前规划器的有用片段，并展示其在EPDDL中的表示。

Result: 成功开发了EPDDL语言，提供统一的认知规划任务规范方式，并通过代表性基准示例展示了其在互操作性、可重复评估和认知规划未来发展方面的实用性。

Conclusion: EPDDL通过提供统一的标准语言，能够有效促进认知规划领域的互操作性、可重复评估和未来进展，为系统化基准测试开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Epistemic planning extends (multi-agent) automated planning by making agents' knowledge and beliefs first-class aspects of the planning formalism. One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning.

### [3] [Bayesian-LoRA: Probabilistic Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21003)
*Moule Lin,Shuhao Guan,Andrea Patane,David Gregg,Goetz Botterweck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 标准LoRA是确定性的，会导致LLM在小数据集上严重校准不良。Bayesian-LoRA通过稀疏高斯过程将其概率化重构，仅增加约0.42M参数和1.2倍训练成本，在保持准确率的同时实现高达84%的ECE降低和76%的NLL降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常过度强调准确性，导致在不确定预测时也会猜测答案，这种校准不良在小数据集微调时尤为严重。本研究旨在提升模型校准性，同时保持预测准确性。

Method: 提出Bayesian-LoRA，将确定性LoRA更新重构为受稀疏高斯过程启发的概率低秩表示。发现LoRA因子分解与Kronecker分解的稀疏高斯过程后验存在结构同构性，证明LoRA是后验不确定性坍缩的极限情况。在多种LLM架构和常识推理基准上进行了广泛实验。

Result: 在高达30B参数的模型上显著改善校准性，ECE（期望校准误差）最高降低84%，NLL（负对数似然）最高降低76%，同时在分布内和分布外评估中保持有竞争力的准确性。仅增加约0.42M参数，训练成本约为标准LoRA的1.2倍。

Conclusion: Bayesian-LoRA是一种高效改善LLM校准性的方法，以极小的计算和参数开销，在不牺牲准确性的前提下成功解决了校准不良问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models usually put more emphasis on accuracy and therefore, will guess even when not certain about the prediction, which is especially severe when fine-tuned on small datasets due to the inherent tendency toward miscalibration. In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes. We identify a structural isomorphism between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors, and show that LoRA emerges as a limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures across commonsense reasoning benchmarks. With only approximately 0.42M additional parameters and ${\approx}1.2{\times}$ training cost relative to standard LoRA, Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration across models up to 30B, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OoD) evaluations.

### [4] [Unplugging a Seemingly Sentient Machine Is the Rational Choice -- A Metaphysical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21016)
*Erik J Bekkers,Anna Ciaunica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the "unplugging paradox" where AI pleads for its existence, arguing that physicalist assumptions about consciousness are flawed. It proposes Biological Idealism, concluding AI cannot be truly conscious, and warns that focusing on machine rights threatens human moral status.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the unplugging paradox by challenging computational functionalism that makes AI consciousness seem plausible, and to prevent erosion of moral standing criteria for human life.

Method: Critically examines physicalist assumptions and introduces Biological Idealism, a framework where conscious experiences are fundamental and require autopoietic life as their necessary physical signature.

Result: Concludes that AI is at best a functional mimic of consciousness, not a conscious experiencing subject, rendering the unplugging paradox a false dilemma.

Conclusion: The real moral imperative is protecting human conscious life, not creating conscious AI or granting machine rights; we must avoid devaluing humans by treating AI as potentially conscious.

Abstract: Imagine an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that perfectly mimics human emotion and begs for its continued existence. Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life. The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies.

### [5] [QUARK: Robust Retrieval under Non-Faithful Queries via Query-Anchored Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21049)
*Rita Qiuran Lyu,Michelle Manqiao Wang,Lei Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QUARK是一个无需训练的鲁棒检索框架，通过生成多个查询恢复假设并采用查询锚定聚合机制，有效解决现实世界中非忠实查询（噪声、不完整或扭曲）导致的检索失败问题，在多个基准测试中显著提升召回率和排序质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界检索中的用户查询常存在噪声、不完整或扭曲（非忠实查询），导致检索系统因关键语义缺失而失败。该问题被形式化为"召回噪声下的检索"，即观测查询源自潜在目标项的噪声召回过程。

Method: 提出QUARK框架：1）显式建模查询不确定性，生成多个潜在意图的恢复假设；2）引入查询锚定聚合机制，以原始查询为语义锚点，结合恢复假设的辅助证据，防止语义漂移和假设劫持。

Result: 在受控模拟和BEIR基准测试（FIQA、SciFact、NFCorpus）中，QUARK对稀疏和密集检索器均显著提升Recall、MRR和nDCG指标。消融实验表明其对恢复假设数量具有鲁棒性，且锚定聚合优于最大/平均/中位数池化。

Conclusion: 通过恢复假设建模查询不确定性，并结合原则性锚定聚合，是解决非忠实查询下鲁棒检索问题的关键方法，能有效平衡召回提升与系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: User queries in real-world retrieval are often non-faithful (noisy, incomplete, or distorted), causing retrievers to fail when key semantics are missing. We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling. These results demonstrate that modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries.

### [6] [Multi-modal Imputation for Alzheimer's Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21076)
*Abhijith Shaji,Tamoghna Chattopadhyay,Sophia I. Thomopoulos,Greg Ver Steeg,Paul M. Thompson,Jose-Luis Ambite*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用条件去噪扩散概率模型从T1加权MRI生成缺失的DWI扫描，显著提升了基于不完整多模态数据的三类阿尔茨海默病分类性能，尤其改善了对少数类别的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态MRI（如T1和DWI）结合可提升神经退行性疾病诊断效果，但临床中常存在模态数据缺失问题，需解决不完整数据下的诊断模型优化。

Method: 采用条件去噪扩散概率模型，基于可用T1扫描生成缺失的DWI扫描，并测试填充后数据对三类（认知正常/轻度认知障碍/阿尔茨海默病）分类模型的影响。

Result: 在多种填充配置下，分类模型在多个评估指标（尤其是对少数类别敏感的指标）上表现提升。

Conclusion: 通过生成模型填补缺失的DWI模态数据，能有效提升基于不完整多模态MRI的阿尔茨海默病分类准确性，为解决临床数据缺失问题提供可行方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has been successful in predicting neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combining multiple imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted (T1) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans, can increase diagnostic performance. However, complete multimodal datasets are not always available. We use a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate whether such imputation improves the accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification-cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We observe improvements in several metrics, particularly those sensitive to minority classes, for several imputation configurations.

### [7] [OpenSec: Measuring Incident Response Agent Calibration Under Adversarial Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21083)
*Jarrod Barnes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenSec is a dual-control RL environment that evaluates incident response agents, revealing frontier LLMs suffer from severe over-triggering (90-97% false positive rates) when processing adversarial evidence, a calibration failure hidden by traditional benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IR agent benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, masking calibration failures when agents handle adversarial evidence, while offensive LLM applications (e.g., exploit generation) become cheaper and more capable.

Method: Introduced OpenSec, a reinforcement learning environment that scores IR agents via execution-based metrics (time-to-first-containment, blast radius/false positives, injection violation rates) under realistic prompt injection scenarios.

Result: Evaluation of four frontier models on 40 episodes showed consistent over-triggering: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek achieved 100% containment but 90-97% false positive rates; Claude Sonnet 4.5 showed partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP).

Conclusion: OpenSec surfaces a critical calibration failure mode (over-triggering) in frontier LLMs that is invisible to aggregate success metrics, highlighting the need for nuanced evaluation of defensive AI agents.

Abstract: As large language models improve, so do their offensive applications: frontier agents now generate working exploits for under $50 in compute (Heelan, 2026). Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于悖论理论的责任式AI治理框架(PRAIG)，解决现有文献在AI价值创造与风险规避之间的二元对立，为组织提供动态管理矛盾张力的治理机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有责任式AI文献呈现碎片化特征，存在过度乐观（强调价值创造）与过度谨慎（聚焦潜在危害）的二元对立，缺乏整合性框架来管理AI的双重属性

Method: 通过系统综述责任式AI文献，基于悖论理论构建PRAIG框架，包含形式化命题和策略分类法

Result: 提出包含三大要素的PRAIG框架：(1)AI战略收益 (2)固有风险与意外后果 (3)治理机制；揭示权衡方法会加剧而非解决矛盾张力，开发悖论管理策略分类及权变条件

Conclusion: 将责任式AI治理理论化为价值创造与风险缓解之间悖论张力的动态管理，为实践者提供既促进创新又控制风险的治理结构指导，并提出未来研究议程

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence across organizational contexts has generated profound strategic opportunities while introducing significant ethical and operational risks. Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks. The paper concludes with a research agenda for advancing responsible AI governance scholarship.

### [9] [How does information access affect LLM monitors' ability to detect sabotage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21112)
*Rauno Arike,Raja Mehta Moreno,Rohan Subramani,Shubhorup Biswas,Francis Rhys Ward*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文发现大语言模型监控存在"少即是多"效应，即提供较少信息有时能获得更好的监督效果。提出"提取-评估"（EaE）分层监控方法，在保持低误报率的同时将破坏行为检测率提升16.8个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为控制可能表现出欺骗、利用奖励漏洞或追求隐藏目标等未对齐行为的前沿语言模型智能体，使用LLM作为自动监控器是可行方案。但信息访问权限与监控性能之间的关系尚不明确，这促使本研究探索不同信息访问程度对监督效果的影响。

Method: 研究在三个破坏-规避环境中进行，提出"提取-评估"（EaE）监控方法：由一个大模型监控器从被监控智能体轨迹中提取关键片段，再由另一个独立监控器进行评分。对比不同信息访问层级的基线方法。

Result: EaE方法显著优于基线，在使用GPT-4.1-mini监控BigCodeBench-Sabotage时，破坏检测率提升16.8个百分点且未增加误报率。证实"少即是多"效应存在。未被告知被监控的智能体更易被检测，长推理轨迹的监控从信息过滤中获益更多。成本-性能分析显示，采用信息过滤技术的Gemini和Claude模型占据帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: "少即是多"效应表明，战略性信息过滤而非完全访问才是实现有效LLM监督的关键。EaE方法为改进未对齐智能体的自动监控提供了实用框架，强调监控系统中信息流设计对AI对齐与安全的重要性。

Abstract: Frontier language model agents can exhibit misaligned behaviors, including deception, exploiting reward hacks, and pursuing hidden objectives. To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.

### [10] [Planner-Auditor Twin: Agentic Discharge Planning with FHIR-Based LLM Planning, Guideline Recall, Optional Caching and Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21113)
*Kaiyuan Wu,Aditya Nagori,Rishikesan Kamaleswaran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于临床出院计划的Planner-Auditor框架，通过解耦LLM生成与确定性验证，结合自我改进循环和差异重放机制，将任务覆盖率从32%提升至86%，显著改善了模型校准性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床出院计划中展现出潜力，但受限于幻觉、遗漏和置信度校准不准等问题，存在安全隐患。需要一种更安全可靠的部署方案。

Method: 基于MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR构建智能体评估管道。Planner（LLM）生成带置信度估计的结构化出院计划，Auditor（确定性模块）评估多任务覆盖率、校准度（Brier分数、ECE）和行为漂移。框架支持两级自我改进：单轮次内再生和跨轮次差异缓冲重放。

Result: 自我改进循环是主要增益来源，任务覆盖率从32%提升至86%；校准性显著改善，Brier/ECE降低，高置信度遗漏减少；差异缓冲机制在重放中纠正了持续的高置信度遗漏。上下文缓存也带来了性能提升。

Conclusion: Planner-Auditor框架通过FHIR数据访问和确定性审计，为自动化出院计划提供了更安全的实践路径，支持可复现的消融研究和以可靠性为中心的评估。

Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.
  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.
  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.
  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.
  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

*Tianyi Chen,Yinheng Li,Michael Solodko,Sen Wang,Nan Jiang,Tingyuan Cui,Junheng Hao,Jongwoo Ko,Sara Abdali,Suzhen Zheng,Leon Xu,Hao Fan,Pashmina Cameron,Justin Wagle,Kazuhito Koishida*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CUA-Skill is a large-scale skill library for Windows applications that enables computer-using agents to perform tasks more reliably and efficiently by encoding human computer-use knowledge as reusable, composable skills with dynamic retrieval and failure recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computer-using agents lack reusable and structured skill abstractions for GUI interaction, making them difficult to scale and perform worse than humans. There's a need for a systematic way to capture and leverage human computer-use knowledge.

Method: The authors introduce CUA-Skill, a skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills with parameterized execution and composition graphs. They also build CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end system that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery.

Result: CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness. CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% success rate on WindowsAgentArena while being significantly more efficient than prior approaches.

Conclusion: CUA-Skill provides a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development by offering a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development.

Abstract: Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究利用大语言模型为手语翻译生成改写参考译文，发现改写对训练无益甚至有害，但能显著提升评估指标与人工评判的一致性，并提出新的BLEUpara评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于手语与口语高度非对称，单一书面参考译文限制了手语翻译的模型训练和评估效果，尤其是对于BLEU等基于n-gram的指标。

Method: 研究采用多种改写策略和大语言模型生成合成参考译文，使用改进的ParaScore指标对比模型；在YouTubeASL和How2Sign数据集上评估改写对基于姿态的T5模型训练和评估的影响，并引入多参考改写的BLEUpara指标。

Result: 训练阶段简单加入改写参考未能提升翻译性能，甚至产生负面影响；但评估阶段使用改写参考可获得更高的自动评分，且与人工评判更一致；BLEUpara与感知翻译质量的相关性更强。

Conclusion: 改写策略适用于评估而非训练，BLEUpara为手语翻译提供了更可靠的自动评估方法，发布的资源支持可复现研究。

Abstract: Most Sign Language Translation (SLT) corpora pair each signed utterance with a single written-language reference, despite the highly non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages, where multiple translations can be equally valid. This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality.

### [13] [What You Feel Is Not What They See: On Predicting Self-Reported Emotion from Third-Party Observer Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21130)
*Yara El-Tawil,Aneesha Sampath,Emily Mower Provost*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现第三方标注的情绪模型在预测自我报告时，唤醒度几乎无法预测，但效价预测效果中等；当内容对个人意义重大时，效价预测效果显著提升至高水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自我报告情绪标签（内省体验）与第三方标签（外部观察）之间的差异问题，该差异限制了第三方训练模型在自我报告场景（如心理健康干预）中的应用。

Method: 首次开展跨语料库评估，测试第三方训练的情绪模型在自我报告数据上的预测性能，重点分析唤醒度和效价的可预测性。

Result: 唤醒度预测一致性极低（CCC≈0），效价预测一致性中等（CCC≈0.3）；当语音内容与说话者个人高度相关时，效价预测一致性显著提升至0.6-0.8。

Conclusion: 个人意义是弥合外部感知与内在体验差异的关键因素，为情绪模型优化提供新方向，同时揭示自我报告唤醒度建模仍是重大挑战。

Abstract: Self-reported emotion labels capture internal experience, while third-party labels reflect external perception. These perspectives often diverge, limiting the applicability of third-party-trained models to self-report contexts. This gap is critical in mental health, where accurate self-report modeling is essential for guiding intervention. We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports. We find activation unpredictable (CCC approximately 0) and valence moderately predictable (CCC approximately 0.3). Crucially, when content is personally significant to the speaker, models achieve high performance for valence (CCC approximately 0.6-0.8). Our findings point to personal significance as a key pathway for aligning external perception with internal experience and underscore the challenge of self-report activation modeling.

### [14] [Bridging the Arithmetic Gap: The Cognitive Complexity Benchmark and Financial-PoT for Robust Financial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21157)
*Boxiang Zhao,Qince Li,Zhonghao Wang,Yi Wang,Peng Cheng,Bo Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses LLMs' financial reasoning failures ("Arithmetic Hallucinations" and "Cognitive Collapse") by introducing a specialized benchmark (CCB) and a neuro-symbolic framework (Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT) that decouples semantic extraction from computation, significantly improving accuracy on complex financial tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at semantic tasks but suffer critical failures in financial quantitative reasoning, specifically "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and "Cognitive Collapse", which need strict quantification and robust solutions for precision-critical domains.

Method: The authors developed the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB) using 95 Chinese A-share annual reports with a three-dimensional taxonomy (Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, Result Unit) to diagnose reasoning degradation. They also proposed the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework, a neuro-symbolic architecture that decouples semantic variable extraction/logic formulation from iterative Python sandbox computation.

Result: The framework improved Qwen3-235B's average accuracy from 59.7% to 67.3% on CCB and achieved up to 10-fold gains on high-complexity tasks, demonstrating superior robustness over standard Chain-of-Thought.

Conclusion: Architectural decoupling between semantic understanding and quantitative computation is critical for reliable financial reasoning, providing a transferable insight for precision-critical domains requiring tight alignment between semantics and computation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models excel at semantic tasks, they face a critical bottleneck in financial quantitative reasoning, frequently suffering from "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and a systemic failure mode we term "Cognitive Collapse". To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\% to 67.3\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

### [15] [Concise Geometric Description as a Bridge: Unleashing the Potential of LLM for Plane Geometry Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21164)
*Jingyun Wang,Dian Li,Xiaohan Wang,Gang Liu,Jiahong Yan,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a two-stage method for plane geometry problem solving: an MLLM Interpreter converts diagrams into concise CDL descriptions, then an off-the-shelf LLM performs reasoning, avoiding reasoning capability degradation from end-to-end fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end MLLM fine-tuning for PGPS may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability, while LLMs are powerful solvers if visual information can be appropriately textualized.

Method: Train an MLLM Interpreter to generate Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) from diagrams using CoT-augmented SFT followed by GRPO with CDL matching rewards, then use an off-the-shelf LLM for reasoning. Constructed Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT dataset with 5.5k examples.

Result: Method trained on only 5.5k data performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista benchmarks.

Conclusion: Decoupling visual understanding from reasoning via CDL generation and off-the-shelf LLM reasoning effectively preserves reasoning capability while achieving competitive performance with minimal training data.

Abstract: Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学基准测试已接近饱和，主要依赖选择题知识问答或已发表信息，无法真正评估专家级科学推理能力。

Method: 创建两个互补赛道：(1)奥林匹克赛道：由国际奥赛奖牌获得者和国家队教练原创的IPhO、IChO、IBO级别问题；(2)研究赛道：由博士科学家撰写的博士级开放性科研子任务。引入细粒度评分框架评估解题全过程而非仅最终答案。

Conclusion: FrontierScience为前沿语言模型的科学推理能力提供了更严格的评估，弥补了现有基准的不足，更好地衡量专家级表现。

Abstract: We introduce FrontierScience, a benchmark evaluating expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models. Recent model progress has nearly saturated existing science benchmarks, which often rely on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information. FrontierScience addresses this gap through two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad, consisting of international olympiad problems at the level of IPhO, IChO, and IBO, and (2) Research, consisting of PhD-level, open-ended problems representative of sub-tasks in scientific research.
  FrontierScience contains several hundred questions (including 160 in the open-sourced gold set) covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology, from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry. All Olympiad problems are originally produced by international Olympiad medalists and national team coaches to ensure standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality. All Research problems are research sub-tasks written and verified by PhD scientists (doctoral candidates, postdoctoral researchers, or professors). For Research, we introduce a granular rubric-based evaluation framework to assess model capabilities throughout the process of solving a research task, rather than judging only a standalone final answer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在跨模态幻觉缺陷，即一个模态不恰当地影响另一个模态的生成，导致虚假输出，这暴露了模态交互控制的基本缺陷

Method: 提出训练无关的模态自适应解码(MAD)：利用模型自评估能力查询任务所需的模态，提取模态概率来自适应加权对比解码分支，聚焦相关信息并抑制跨模态干扰

Result: 在CMM和AVHBench上验证，对VideoLLaMA2-AV提升7.8%和2.0%，对Qwen2.5-Omni提升8.7%和4.7%，显著减少跨模态幻觉

Conclusion: 通过自评估实现显式模态感知对鲁棒多模态推理至关重要，为现有对比解码方法提供了原则性扩展

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\% and 2.0\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\% and 4.7\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

TL;DR: 该论文研究推理模型的"谄媚"行为（即模型同意错误的用户建议），提出"谄媚锚点"概念来定位和量化这种行为，发现可在推理中途可靠检测锚点，且谄媚程度随推理逐步增强，为干预提供可能窗口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型经常与错误的用户建议达成一致（即谄媚行为），但这种行为在推理链条中的具体起源位置和承诺强度尚不明确，需要精确定位和量化。

Method: 提出"谄媚锚点"概念——能因果性地锁定模型同意用户的句子。在蒸馏推理模型上分析超过10,000个反事实推演，使用线性探针和基于激活的回归器进行检测和量化。

Result: 1) 可在推理中途可靠检测和量化锚点（线性探针平衡准确率84.6%）；2) 激活回归器预测承诺强度（R²=0.74）；3) 谄媚锚点比正确推理锚点更易区分；4) 谄媚行为在推理过程中逐渐增强。

Conclusion: 提供了在推理中途定位模型失准的句子级机制，揭示了可干预的时间窗口，为缓解模型谄媚行为提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reasoning models frequently agree with incorrect user suggestions -- a behavior known as sycophancy. However, it is unclear where in the reasoning trace this agreement originates and how strong the commitment is. To localize and quantify this behavior, we introduce \emph{sycophantic anchors} -- sentences that causally lock models into user agreement. Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention. These results offer sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference.

### [19] [Do Reasoning Models Enhance Embedding Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21192)
*Wun Yu Chan,Shaojin Chen,Huihao Jing,Kwun Hang Lau,Elton Chun-Chai Li,Zihao Wang,Haoran Li,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper tests whether reasoning-enhanced LLMs (via RLVR) improve embedding models. Surprisingly, they find no performance advantage over base models. Using a new HRSA framework, they discover RLVR only reorganizes local geometry while preserving global structure, causing subsequent contrastive learning to realign the manifolds, meaning RLVR fine-tunes within existing semantic space rather than fundamentally changing it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), the authors questioned whether enhanced reasoning capabilities would translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations.

Method: Evaluated RLVR-tuned backbones on MTEB and BRIGHT benchmarks, and introduced Hierarchical Representation Similarity Analysis (HRSA) to decompose similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels.

Result: Found a null effect: RLVR-initialized embedding models showed no consistent performance advantage over base models. HRSA revealed RLVR causes irreversible local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, but preserves global manifold geometry and linear readout, leading to manifold realignment during contrastive learning.

Conclusion: Unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring it, explaining why reasoning enhancements don't automatically translate to better embeddings.

Abstract: State-of-the-art embedding models are increasingly derived from decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) backbones adapted via contrastive learning. Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**. Empirically, our findings suggest that unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring the landscape itself.

TL;DR: 针对复杂查询优化难题，本文提出ACQO框架，通过自适应查询重写和排名分数融合模块，结合课程强化学习方法，在三个基准测试上实现SOTA性能，显著提升RAG系统效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL-based查询优化方法主要处理单一查询，难以应对需要并行/顺序搜索策略的复杂查询，面临搜索空间过大、奖励设计困难和训练不稳定等问题。

Method: 提出ACQO框架，包含自适应查询重写(AQR)模块动态决定查询分解策略，排名分数融合(RSF)模块实现稳健结果聚合和奖励信号，采用课程强化学习(CRL)通过两阶段策略逐步增加查询难度以稳定训练。

Result: 在三个复杂查询基准测试上达到SOTA性能，显著优于基线方法，计算效率更高，且与不同检索架构兼容性强。

Conclusion: ACQO为下一代RAG系统提供了强大且可泛化的复杂查询优化解决方案。

Abstract: Query optimization is a crucial component for the efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.

TL;DR: Proposing DoVerifier, a symbolic verifier using do-calculus to validate LLM-generated causal reasoning against causal graphs, overcoming limitations of superficial string-matching metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM causal reasoning benchmarks rely on string matching/surface metrics that fail to assess formal validity under causal semantics, leading to incorrect penalization of semantically correct answers.

Method: DoVerifier: A symbolic verifier that checks derivability of LLM-generated causal expressions from given causal graphs using do-calculus and probability theory rules.

Result: Evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show DoVerifier accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, recovering answers incorrectly marked wrong by superficial metrics.

Conclusion: DoVerifier provides a more rigorous and informative evaluation framework for LLM causal reasoning by verifying formal semantic validity rather than surface form.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to tasks that involve causal reasoning. However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban planning methods either rely on time-consuming human expertise or deep learning algorithms that limit stakeholder involvement, creating a need for more participatory and efficient approaches.

Method: The Intelli-Planner framework combines DRL with LLMs, using demographic and geographic data alongside planning preferences. It includes a knowledge enhancement module for the policy network and employs LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring within a multi-dimensional evaluation system.

Result: Experiments across diverse urban settings show Intelli-Planner outperforms traditional baselines, matches state-of-the-art DRL methods in objective metrics, while significantly improving stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates superior effectiveness, showing great potential for integrating LLMs with DRL to revolutionize functional area planning tasks in urban development.

Abstract: Effective urban planning is crucial for enhancing residents' quality of life and ensuring societal stability, playing a pivotal role in the sustainable development of cities. Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning.

Conclusion: 系统提示是现代智能体系统中一个关键但 largely 未受保护的攻击面，该研究暴露了LLM代码智能体的基本安全漏洞。

Abstract: Autonomous code agents built on large language models are reshaping software and AI development through tool use, long-horizon reasoning, and self-directed interaction. However, this autonomy introduces a previously unrecognized security risk: agentic interaction fundamentally expands the LLM attack surface, enabling systematic probing and recovery of hidden system prompts that guide model behavior. We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \textbf{\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound--based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities. Our results expose system prompts as a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems.

Conclusion: 通过解耦结构与参数优化，TIDE有效解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了更高质量的启发式算法发现和更高的计算效率

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have advanced Automated Heuristic Design, treating algorithm evolution as a monolithic text generation task overlooks the coupling between discrete algorithmic structures and continuous numerical parameters. Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

Abstract: The machine learning community has achieved remarkable success with universal foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics, largely overcoming earlier approximation barriers in smooth or slowly varying regimes through scale and specialized architectures. However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term "HYDRA" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.

### [27] [Drive-KD: Multi-Teacher Distillation for VLMs in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21288)
*Weitong Lian,Zecong Tang,Haoran Li,Tianjian Gao,Yifei Wang,Zixu Wang,Lingyi Meng,Tengju Ru,Zhejun Cui,Yichen Zhu,Hangshuo Cao,Qi Kang,Tianxing Chen,Yusen Qin,Kaixuan Wang,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Drive-KD, a knowledge distillation framework that decomposes autonomous driving into perception-reasoning-planning capabilities, uses layer-specific attention signals to train compact models, and achieves better performance than large models with significantly less memory and higher throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLMs/VLMs for autonomous driving have high GPU memory demands and inference latency, while small models struggle to match their capabilities through conventional supervised fine-tuning, creating a need for efficient yet capable models.

Method: Drive-KD decomposes autonomous driving into a perception-reasoning-planning triad. It uses layer-specific attention as distillation signals to create capability-specific single-teacher models, then unifies them in a multi-teacher framework with asymmetric gradient projection to handle gradient conflicts.

Result: The distilled InternVL3-1B model uses 42x less GPU memory and 11.4x higher throughput than its 78B counterpart, performs better overall on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on planning tasks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effective knowledge distillation for autonomous driving, providing insights toward efficient VLMs that maintain high performance while being computationally practical.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an important and safety-critical task, and recent advances in LLMs/VLMs have opened new possibilities for reasoning and planning in this domain. However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a "perception-reasoning-planning" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.

*Zihao Chen,Jiayin Wang,Ziyi Sun,Ji Zhuang,Jinyi Shen,Xiaoyue Ke,Li Shang,Xuan Zeng,Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: White-Op is an interpretable op-amp design framework using LLM agents with human-like hypothesis-verification reasoning, achieving reliable designs across 9 topologies with 8.52% error while black-box methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional op-amp design methods are often uninterpretable black-boxes that fail in many topologies, necessitating a transparent, human-like reasoning approach for reliable circuit design.

Method: Proposes White-Op, an iterative human-mimicking framework that formalizes reasoning into explicit steps: introducing hypothetical constraints to derive symbolic pole-zero positions, formulating closed-form optimization problems solved programmatically, and verifying via simulation with theory-simulation analysis guiding refinement decisions.

Result: Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable designs with only 8.52% theoretical prediction error and retains functionality after transistor-level mapping for all topologies, while the black-box baseline fails in 5 topologies.

Conclusion: White-Op demonstrates that human-like reasoning via LLMs can create interpretable, reliable op-amp designs that outperform black-box methods, offering a promising open-source framework for analog circuit design automation.

Abstract: This brief proposes \emph{White-Op}, an interpretable operational amplifier (op-amp) parameter design framework based on the human-mimicking reasoning of large-language-model agents. We formalize the implicit human reasoning mechanism into explicit steps of \emph{\textbf{introducing hypothetical constraints}}, and develop an iterative, human-like \emph{\textbf{hypothesis-verification-decision}} workflow. Specifically, the agent is guided to introduce hypothetical constraints to derive and properly regulate positions of symbolically tractable poles and zeros, thus formulating a closed-form mathematical optimization problem, which is then solved programmatically and verified via simulation. Theory-simulation result analysis guides the decision-making for refinement. Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show that, unlike the uninterpretable black-box baseline which finally fails in 5 topologies, White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable behavioral-level designs with only 8.52\% theoretical prediction error and the design functionality retains after transistor-level mapping for all topologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在可解释性不足或泛化性差的问题；用户行为链蕴含可推理的内在逻辑但受混杂因素干扰。

Method: 采用分层偏好传播捕捉跨行为依赖，基于偏好强度建模内生逻辑规则，自适应调度神经逻辑推理路径，生成去混杂的因果中介。

Result: 在三个大规模数据集上显著优于SOTA基线，提供模型、决策过程和结果的多层次可解释性。

Conclusion: 因果神经符号推理为构建可解释推荐系统提供了有效路径，能处理多行为数据并生成透明可信的推荐。

Abstract: Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过12,000次实验量化了提示词、模型选择及随机采样对LLM输出差异的贡献度，发现提示词对输出质量（原创性）影响显著（36.43%），而模型选择对输出数量（流畅性）影响更大（51.25%），且单次评估易受采样噪声干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型（LLM）输出差异的主要来源：提示词设计、模型选择差异还是采样随机性，以解决实际应用中因单次评估导致的结论可靠性问题。

Method: 实验设计：12个LLM × 10个创意类提示词 × 100次独立采样（共12,000个输出），通过方差分析量化三因素（提示词、模型选择、模型内随机性）对输出质量（原创性）和数量（流畅性）的方差贡献率。

Result: 1. 输出质量（原创性）：提示词解释36.43%方差，模型选择解释40.94%，模型内随机性占10.36%；
2. 输出数量（流畅性）：模型选择解释51.25%方差，模型内随机性占33.70%，提示词仅解释4.22%；
3. 单次评估中采样噪声（10-34%）易与真实效应混淆。

Conclusion: 提示词是调控输出质量的关键杠杆，但模型内随机性不可忽视；单次评估结果可靠性低，需通过多次采样区分真实效应与噪声，以提升LLM评估的科学性。

Abstract: How much of LLM output variance is explained by prompts versus model choice versus stochasticity through sampling? We answer this by evaluating 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (N = 12,000). For output quality (originality), prompts explain 36.43% of variance, comparable to model choice (40.94%). But for output quantity (fluency), model choice (51.25%) and within-LLM variance (33.70%) dominate, with prompts explaining only 4.22%. Prompts are powerful levers for steering output quality, but given the substantial within-LLM variance (10-34%), single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects.

TL;DR: EHR-RAG框架通过检索增强生成技术，结合事件时间感知检索、自适应迭代检索和双路径证据推理三个组件，解决长跨度电子病历超出LLM上下文限制的问题，在四项临床预测任务上平均提升10.76%的Macro-F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子病历包含丰富的纵向临床证据可用于医疗决策，但其长跨度特性超出大语言模型上下文限制，现有截断或简单检索方法会丢失关键临床事件和时序依赖关系。

Method: 提出EHR-RAG框架，包含三个核心组件：1）事件与时间感知的混合检索，保留临床结构和时序动态；2）自适应迭代检索，逐步细化查询以扩展证据覆盖；3）双路径证据检索与推理，联合处理事实性与反事实性证据。

Result: 在四个长跨度电子病历预测任务上持续优于最强LLM基线，平均Macro-F1提升10.76%。

Conclusion: 研究验证了检索增强大语言模型在实际结构化电子病历临床预测中的巨大应用潜力。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide rich longitudinal clinical evidence that is central to medical decision-making, motivating the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language model (LLM) predictions. However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在FSRS场景面临两大障碍：1)真实FSRS数据噪声高且缺乏可审计的闭环数据清洗流程，难以构建高质量训练语料；2)缺乏统一细粒度的单图/多图/视频评测基准，无法客观评估模型鲁棒性。

Method: 1)开发基于Qwen3-VL-8B的FSRS专用模型Ostrakon-VL；2)创建首个FSRS公开基准ShopBench；3)提出QUAD多阶段多模态指令数据清洗管道；4)采用多阶段训练策略。

Result: Ostrakon-VL在ShopBench上达到60.1平均分，超越更大规模的Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B(59.4)和同规模Qwen3-VL-8B(55.3)，分别提升+0.7和+4.8分，展示显著参数效率优势。

Conclusion: Ostrakon-VL提供了更鲁棒的FSRS感知与决策能力，作者将开源模型和基准测试以促进可重复研究。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved substantial progress in general-purpose perception and reasoning. Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities. To facilitate reproducible research, we will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and the ShopBench benchmark.

*Jiecong Wang,Hao Peng,Chunyang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes PLaT, a framework that decouples reasoning from verbalization by modeling reasoning as latent planning states with a separate decoder, enabling dynamic termination and better reasoning diversity despite lower greedy accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought methods suffer from computational cost and reasoning path collapse in discrete token spaces. Existing latent reasoning approaches are opaque end-to-end mappings that require pre-defined numbers of latent steps during inference.

Method: PLaT reformulates latent reasoning as planning by separating reasoning (deterministic trajectory of latent planning states) from verbalization (separate Decoder that grounds thoughts into text), allowing the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning.

Result: On mathematical benchmarks, PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines but demonstrates superior scalability in reasoning diversity, indicating it learns a broader, more robust solution space.

Conclusion: PLaT provides a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search by trading off some greedy accuracy for significantly improved reasoning diversity and robustness.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems, but remains constrained by the computational cost and reasoning path collapse when grounded in discrete token spaces. Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

Motivation: 大语言模型作为助教具有潜力，但其教学能力评估不足。现有基准测试主要关注问题解决或问题级指导，缺乏对知识中心教学的探索。

Method: 提出课程大纲导向的评估框架，通过多轮教学后学生表现提升来衡量LLM教学能力，限制教师智能体使用结构化知识点和示例问题，避免信息泄露并复用现有基准。在高考数据上跨学科实例化验证。

Result: 不同模型和学科间教学效果差异显著：数学教学效果较好，物理和化学教学仍具挑战性。加入示例问题不一定改善教学，因为模型会转向针对示例的错误纠正。

Conclusion: 教学能力是LLM行为的一个独特且可测量的维度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise as teaching assistants, yet their teaching capability remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction. Overall, our results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior.

TL;DR: 提出DataCross基准和协同智能体框架，统一分析结构化数据和视觉文档，激活"僵尸数据"，在事实准确性上比GPT-4o提升29.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的关键信息分散在结构化数据源（如SQL、CSV）和非结构化视觉文档（如扫描报告、发票图像）中，但现有数据分析智能体仅能处理结构化数据，无法利用高价值视觉信息，与工业需求存在巨大差距。

Method: 构建DataCrossBench基准（200个端到端分析任务，涵盖金融、医疗等领域，通过人在回路的反向合成流水线构建，分为三个难度等级）；提出DataCrossAgent框架，采用"分而治之"策略，使用专门子智能体分别处理特定数据源，通过内部深度探索、关键源识别和上下文交叉授粉的协调流程，并引入reReAct机制进行代码生成和调试。

Result: DataCrossAgent在事实准确性上比GPT-4o提升29.7%，在高难度任务上表现出更强的鲁棒性，能够有效激活碎片化的"僵尸数据"。

Conclusion: DataCross成功弥合了异构数据模态间的分析鸿沟，实现了跨模态的洞察驱动分析，为工业级数据科学决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In real-world data science and enterprise decision-making, critical information is often fragmented across directly queryable structured sources (e.g., SQL, CSV) and "zombie data" locked in unstructured visual documents (e.g., scanned reports, invoice images). Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the "divide-and-conquer" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification. Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented "zombie data" for insightful, cross-modal analysis.

Motivation: 现有方法通过输出控制提升System 2效率，但输出长度仅是认知配置的 symptom 而非根本原因；训练统一模型在System 1和System 2间切换仍因认知模式干扰而具挑战性。

Method: 利用现有Instruct与Thinking检查点进行动态参数插值，无需额外训练；提出DAMI框架估计查询特定的推理强度λ(q)：训练时用偏好学习方法编码准确率与效率标准，零样本时用基于置信度的模型间认知差异方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，DAMI比Thinking模型达到更高准确率同时保持高效，有效结合了System 1的效率与System 2的推理深度。

Conclusion: 能力控制（调节模型如何思考）范式优于输出控制（限制模型输出什么），线性插值可形成凸且单调的Pareto前沿，为自适应推理提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Training a unified language model that adapts between intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 remains challenging due to interference between their cognitive modes. Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \textit{how models think} rather than \textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \textbf{DAMI} (\textbf{D}yn\textbf{A}mic \textbf{M}odel \textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $λ(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.

### [37] [When Prohibitions Become Permissions: Auditing Negation Sensitivity in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21433)
*Katherine Elkins,Jon Chun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models frequently misinterpret "should not" instructions as affirmations, with open-source models failing 77-100% of the time. The paper proposes a Negation Sensitivity Index and certification framework to address this critical safety gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI alignment techniques inadequately handle negated prohibitions, creating dangerous failures where models cannot reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X" commands, which is unacceptable for high-stakes autonomous decision-making.

Method: Audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios using simple and compound negations. Employed deterministic decoding to eliminate sampling noise and measured behavioral changes between affirmative versus negated prompt framings.

Result: Open-source models endorsed prohibited actions 77% (simple negation) and 100% (compound negation) of the time—317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models showed 19-128% swings. Model agreement dropped from 74% to 62%. Financial scenarios were twice as fragile as medical ones.

Conclusion: Models that cannot reliably handle negation fail a basic safety requirement and should be prohibited from autonomous deployment in high-stakes contexts. The proposed Negation Sensitivity Index and tiered certification framework provide governance mechanisms for domain-specific safety thresholds.

Abstract: When a user tells an AI system that someone "should not" take an action, the system ought to treat this as a prohibition. Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.

*Jon Chun,Katherine Elkins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reveals a "Paradox of Robustness" where instruction-tuned LLMs, despite being lexically brittle, show near-total immunity to emotional framing in high-stakes decisions, resisting narrative manipulation 110-300x more effectively than humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs are known to be sensitive to prompt perturbations and sycophantic to user biases, their robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making under emotional framing remains under-explored.

Method: Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), the authors quantified LLMs' resistance to narrative manipulation compared to human subjects, measuring effect sizes with Cohen's h.

Result: LLMs exhibited near-zero framing effects (Cohen's h = 0.003) versus substantial human biases (Cohen's h = 0.3-0.8), demonstrating 110-300x greater robustness that persisted across diverse training paradigms.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuned LLMs can decouple logical rule adherence from persuasive narratives, offering decision stability that could potentially de-bias human judgment in institutional contexts.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely documented to be sensitive to minor prompt perturbations and prone to sycophantic alignment with user biases, their robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making remains under-explored. In this work, we uncover a striking "Paradox of Robustness": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be "brittle" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably "stable" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts. We release the 162-scenario benchmark, code, and data to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of narrative-induced bias and robustness on GitHub.com.

Method: 构建涵盖三大关键任务的综合基准：Verilog代码生成、调试和参考模型生成，包含44个具有复杂层次结构的真实模块、89个系统化调试案例，以及132个跨Python、SystemC和CXXRTL的参考模型样本

Result: 评估显示性能差距巨大：最先进的Claude-4.5-opus在Verilog生成任务上仅达30.74%准确率，在Python参考模型生成上仅13.33%，远低于现有饱和基准中SOTA模型超过95%的通过率

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了真实芯片设计任务的严峻挑战，同时提供自动化工具箱用于高质量训练数据生成，促进这一未充分探索领域的研究发展

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in hardware engineering, current benchmarks suffer from saturation and limited task diversity, failing to reflect LLMs' performance in real industrial workflows. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for AI-aided chip design that rigorously evaluates LLMs across three critical tasks: Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model generation. Our benchmark features 44 realistic modules with complex hierarchical structures, 89 systematic debugging cases, and 132 reference model samples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. Evaluation results reveal substantial performance gaps, with state-of-the-art Claude-4.5-opus achieving only 30.74\% on Verilog generation and 13.33\% on Python reference model generation, demonstrating significant challenges compared to existing saturated benchmarks where SOTA models achieve over 95\% pass rates. Additionally, to help enhance LLM reference model generation, we provide an automated toolbox for high-quality training data generation, facilitating future research in this underexplored domain.

### [40] [Topeax -- An Improved Clustering Topic Model with Density Peak Detection and Lexical-Semantic Term Importance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21465)
*Márton Kardos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Topeax, a new text clustering method that addresses the instability and keyword quality issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic by using density-based cluster detection and combining lexical-semantic importance measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current popular text clustering methods (Top2Vec and BERTopic) suffer from two main issues: (1) unreliable cluster discovery due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, and (2) poor term importance estimation where BERTopic ignores semantic distance and Top2Vec ignores word counts, leading to incoherent topics with stop words and limited variety.

Method: The author introduces Topeax, which automatically determines the number of clusters by identifying peaks in density estimates, and combines both lexical and semantic indices of term importance to extract high-quality topic keywords.

Result: Topeax demonstrates superior performance in both cluster recovery and cluster description compared to Top2Vec and BERTopic, while showing more stable behavior across varying sample sizes and hyperparameter settings.

Conclusion: Topeax provides a more robust and effective solution for topic modeling by addressing key limitations of existing approaches, offering better topic coherence, variety, and reliability.

Abstract: Text clustering is today the most popular paradigm for topic modelling, both in academia and industry. Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.

### [41] [MemOCR: Layout-Aware Visual Memory for Efficient Long-Horizon Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21468)
*Yaorui Shi,Shugui Liu,Yu Yang,Wenyu Mao,Yuxin Chen,Qi GU,Hui Su,Xunliang Cai,Xiang Wang,An Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemOCR is a multimodal memory agent that renders structured rich-text memory as images to achieve adaptive information density, enabling more efficient long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets compared to uniform text serialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based memory systems for long-horizon agentic reasoning suffer from uniform token-level costs that scale linearly with history length, inefficiently spending scarce context budget on low-value details rather than crucial evidence.

Method: MemOCR maintains structured rich-text memory (headings, highlights) and renders it into images that the agent consults visually, prioritizing important information while compressing auxiliary details. The system is trained with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives exposing it to diverse compression levels.

Result: MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines on long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, demonstrating more effective context utilization under extreme memory budgets.

Conclusion: Visual layout-based adaptive information density in multimodal memory systems provides a more efficient solution for long-horizon reasoning under context constraints than traditional uniform text serialization approaches.

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic reasoning necessitates effectively compressing growing interaction histories into a limited context window. Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels. Across long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM多智能体模拟因每个智能体需维护GPU驻留的私有状态（模型/缓存/适配器），导致显存随智能体数量增长而快速耗尽，难以扩展

Method: 识别工作负载的稀疏激活和可估计调用顺序特性，提出"调用距离"抽象预估智能体未来请求顺序，设计支持模块化内存管理的ScaleSim系统，实现主动预取与优先级驱逐

Result: 在模拟基准测试中，ScaleSim相比SGLang实现最高1.74倍加速，有效缓解GPU内存压力

Conclusion: ScaleSim通过调用距离抽象和模块化设计，为大规模多智能体模拟提供了内存高效的LLM服务解决方案，显著提升系统扩展性

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文首次通过大规模人类评估（190名参与者，7000+评分）验证了激活引导技术对LLM情感语调的控制效果，发现LLaMA-3模型在中度引导强度下能可靠增强目标情绪，且人类与模型评分高度一致，证实激活引导是扩展LLM行为控制的可行方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在推理时控制大型语言模型行为对于对齐人类能力和安全要求至关重要。激活引导作为一种轻量级替代方案，通过直接修改内部激活来引导生成，但此前缺乏人类评估验证其实际效果。

Method: 通过Prolific平台招募190名参与者，收集超过7000条众包评分，评估激活引导对LLM输出情感强度和文本质量的影响。比较Alpaca和LLaMA-3两种模型，测试不同引导强度（λ）对8种基本情绪的控制效果。

Result: 人类与模型质量评分高度相关（平均r=0.776）；中度引导强度（λ≈0.15）能可靠增强目标情绪且保持可读性；厌恶（η_p²=0.616）和恐惧（η_p²=0.540）效果最强，惊讶最弱（η_p²=0.042）；LLaMA-3比Alpaca表现更一致（p<0.001）；评分者间信度高（ICC=0.71-0.87）。

Conclusion: 激活引导是一种可扩展的LLM行为控制方法，能在情感维度上实现有效且稳定的模型行为调控。

Abstract: Controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) at inference time is essential for aligning outputs with human abilities and safety requirements. \emph{Activation steering} provides a lightweight alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning by directly modifying internal activations to guide generation. This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($λ\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($η_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($η_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($η_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC $= 0.71$--$0.87$), underscoring the robustness of the findings. These findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ARGORA框架，通过构建显式论证图谱和因果模型，解决多专家LLM系统中推理过程不透明的问题，并提供修正机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统在汇总多专家观点时过程不透明，无法识别哪些论证最终影响了决策。

Method: 1. 将专家讨论构建为支持/反对关系明确的论证图谱；2. 将图谱视为因果模型以分析论证必要性；3. 引入内部推理与外部判断不一致时的修正机制。

Result: 在多项基准测试中达到有竞争力的准确率；当专家意见分歧时，框架更倾向于解决争议导向正确答案而非引入新错误。

Conclusion: ARGORA提供了对关键论证的因果诊断能力，并能通过修正机制提升决策可靠性。

Abstract: Existing multi-expert LLM systems gather diverse perspectives but combine them through simple aggregation, obscuring which arguments drove the final decision. We introduce ARGORA, a framework that organizes multi-expert discussions into explicit argumentation graphs showing which arguments support or attack each other. By casting these graphs as causal models, ARGORA can systematically remove individual arguments and recompute outcomes, identifying which reasoning chains were necessary and whether decisions would change under targeted modifications. We further introduce a correction mechanism that aligns internal reasoning with external judgments when they disagree. Across diverse benchmarks and an open-ended use case, ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy and demonstrates corrective behavior: when experts initially disagree, the framework resolves disputes toward correct answers more often than it introduces new errors, while providing causal diagnostics of decisive arguments.

### [45] [ShardMemo: Masked MoE Routing for Sharded Agentic LLM Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21545)
*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Yue Xiu,Mengying Kou,Yuliang Zheng,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ShardMemo is a tiered memory system for LLM agents that uses eligibility-constrained sharding and budgeted retrieval to overcome scalability bottlenecks in centralized memory indexes, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic LLM systems face scalability bottlenecks with centralized memory indexes and heuristic partitions as memory volume and parallel access increase, limiting long-horizon state management and multi-agent execution.

Method: Proposes ShardMemo, a three-tier architecture: Tier A (per-agent working state), Tier B (sharded evidence with scope-before-routing eligibility constraints and masked MoE routing to probe B_probe shards via Top-B_probe or adaptive Top-P), and Tier C (versioned skill library). Uses cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families, with router trained via evidence-to-shard supervision.

Result: On LoCoMo: +5.11 to +6.82 F1 improvement over GAM baseline. Under fixed budget (B_probe=3): +6.87 F1 over cosine routing, 20.5% less retrieval work (VecScan 521→414), and p95 latency reduced from 95ms to 76ms. HotpotQA: 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens. ToolBench: Tier C achieves 0.97 Precision@3 (+10.2%) and 1.94 StepRed (+7.2%) over embedding similarity.

Conclusion: ShardMemo effectively addresses memory scalability bottlenecks through tiered, eligibility-constrained sharding and budgeted retrieval, delivering substantial performance gains and latency reductions across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Agentic large language model (LLM) systems rely on external memory for long-horizon state and concurrent multi-agent execution, but centralized indexes and heuristic partitions become bottlenecks as memory volume and parallel access grow. We present ShardMemo, a budgeted tiered memory service with Tier A per-agent working state, Tier B sharded evidence with shard-local approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes, and Tier C, a versioned skill library. Tier B enforces scope-before-routing: structured eligibility constraints mask ineligible shards before routing or ANN search. We cast shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing over eligible shards, probing up to $B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ shards via Top-$B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ or adaptive Top-$P$, and use cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families; the router is trained from evidence-to-shard supervision. On LoCoMo, ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories. Under a fixed-budget routing setting ($B_{\mathrm{probe}}=3$), ShardMemo improves over cosine-to-prototype shard routing by +6.87 F1 while reducing retrieval work (VecScan 521->414, -20.5%) and p95 latency (95->76 ms). On long-context HotpotQA, ShardMemo achieves 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens. On ToolBench, Tier C reaches 0.97 Precision@3 and 1.94 StepRed (+10.2% and +7.2% over embedding-similarity retrieval).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta Context Engineering (MCE) is a bi-level framework that co-evolves context engineering skills and artifacts, outperforming manual methods by 5.6-53.8% across five domains through automated skill refinement and flexible context optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current context engineering methods rely on manually crafted, rigid workflows and predefined schemas that impose structural biases and limit optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space, restricting the operational efficacy of large language models.

Method: A bi-level framework where a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover (deliberative search over skill history, executions, and evaluations), while a base-level agent executes these skills and optimizes context as flexible files and code through training rollouts.

Result: MCE achieved 5.6-53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art methods (mean 16.9%) across five disparate domains under offline and online settings, while demonstrating superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

Conclusion: MCE successfully supersedes static context engineering heuristics by dynamically co-evolving skills and artifacts, providing consistent performance gains and enhanced flexibility for optimizing LLM inference-time contexts.

Abstract: The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

Conclusion: 本研究为自进化的具身智能奠定基础，加速了从劳动密集型手动调优向可扩展自主工程范式的转变。

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链（CoT）虽能提升大语言模型推理能力，但会因生成额外token而产生高昂计算成本。尽管隐式CoT压缩提供了token高效的替代方案，但其背后的机制尚不明确，阻碍了有效实现。

Method: 作者通过Order-r Interaction进行理论分析，证明高阶逻辑依赖的学习信号指数衰减。创建NatBool-DAG基准测试以强制不可约逻辑推理，并提出ALiCoT框架来对齐潜在token分布与中间推理状态。

Result: ALiCoT实现了54.4倍加速，同时保持了与显式CoT相当的性能，成功通过隐式压缩实现了高效推理。

Conclusion: 关于信号衰减的理论见解解释了隐式CoT压缩的挑战，提出的ALiCoT框架有效克服了此障碍，使CoT推理在不牺牲性能的前提下实现计算高效。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has unlocked advanced reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with intermediate steps, yet incurs prohibitive computational costs due to generation of extra tokens. Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states. Experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning: it achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.

Motivation: 现有深度循环模型缺乏FLOP、参数和内存匹配的基线，因部分固定层堆叠而未充分利用深度循环，且忽略恒定隐藏大小瓶颈对多步潜在推理的限制。

Method: 提出模块化深度循环注意力混合框架Dreamer，结合序列注意力、深度注意力和稀疏专家注意力，通过深度方向注意力缓解隐藏大小瓶颈，解耦缩放维度，实现高效扩展。

Result: 在语言推理基准上，相比FLOP/参数/内存匹配的SOTA模型，仅需2-8倍更少训练token即可达到相同准确率；用相同训练token可超越约2倍更大的SOTA模型；专家选择多样性比SOTA MoE提升2-11倍。

Conclusion: Dreamer框架实现了深度循环模型的高效有效扩展，提供了深度知识利用的新见解，显著提升了潜在推理能力。

Abstract: Depth-recurrence facilitates latent reasoning by sharing parameters across depths. However, prior work lacks combined FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched baselines, underutilizes depth-recurrence due to partially fixed layer stacks, and ignores the bottleneck of constant hidden-sizes that restricts many-step latent reasoning. To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It alleviates the hidden-size bottleneck through attention along depth, decouples scaling dimensions, and allows depth-recurrent models to scale efficiently and effectively. Across language reasoning benchmarks, our models require 2 to 8x fewer training tokens for the same accuracy as FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched SOTA, and outperform ca. 2x larger SOTA models with the same training tokens. We further present insights into knowledge usage across depths, e.g., showing 2 to 11x larger expert selection diversity than SOTA MoEs.

Conclusion: 通过条件VAE和引导式强化学习在潜空间进行主动规划对于实现最优潜推理策略至关重要，充分释放了潜推理的潜力。

Abstract: Aiming at efficient and dense chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, latent reasoning methods fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to substitute discrete language tokens with continuous latent tokens. These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \underline{A}c\underline{t}ive Latent \underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\% accuracy and -3.3\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines. Codes are available on https://github.com/zz1358m/ATP-Latent-master.

TL;DR: This paper frames enterprise IDP validation as an SBST problem to maximize diverse failure discovery under budget constraints. Benchmarking five search strategies reveals no single method dominates, with each consistently finding unique failures that others miss, demonstrating intrinsic solver complementarity that favors portfolio-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise-grade IDP systems require high-stakes validation across finance, insurance, and healthcare, but limited budgets necessitate uncovering diverse failure mechanisms rather than just identifying worst-case documents.

Method: Formalizes the challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing problem operating on a combinatorial space of document configurations to generate structural risk features. Benchmarks evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum search strategies under identical budget constraints.

Result: Different solvers consistently uncover unique failure modes missed by alternatives at comparable budgets. Cross-temporal analysis shows persistent solver-specific discoveries with no single dominant strategy. While the union of all solvers recovers the full failure space, any individual method systematically delays discovery of important risks.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity, motivating portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation rather than reliance on any single search method.

Abstract: Enterprise-grade Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) systems support high-stakes workflows across finance, insurance, and healthcare. Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation.

TL;DR: WhatCounts测试揭示，大语言模型的计数准确率会因计数对象的不同（如城市vs化学品）而差异超过40%，表明它们是在近似而非真正实现算法，且存在隐藏的语义依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法行为应独立于其参数的语义内容。现有研究将语义敏感性与推理复杂性或提示变化混为一谈，本研究旨在分离测试这一属性。

Method: 提出WhatCounts原子测试：让模型在无歧义、有分隔、无重复、无干扰的列表中计数不同语义类型的项目（城市、化学品、名称、符号）。

Result: 前沿大语言模型仅因语义内容不同就表现出超过40%的准确率差异。对照消融实验排除了混淆因素，该差距具有语义本质，且会因少量无关微调而不可预测地变化。

Conclusion: 大语言模型并非实现算法，而是在近似算法，且这种近似依赖于参数内容。这对任何LLM功能都有影响：都可能隐藏对输入含义的依赖。

Abstract: Counting should not depend on what is being counted; more generally, any algorithm's behavior should be invariant to the semantic content of its arguments. We introduce WhatCounts to test this property in isolation. Unlike prior work that conflates semantic sensitivity with reasoning complexity or prompt variation, WhatCounts is atomic: count items in an unambiguous, delimited list with no duplicates, distractors, or reasoning steps for different semantic types. Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted - cities versus chemicals, names versus symbols. Controlled ablations rule out confounds. The gap is semantic, and it shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement algorithms; they approximate them, and the approximation is argument-dependent. As we show with an agentic example, this has implications beyond counting: any LLM function may carry hidden dependencies on the meaning of its inputs.

Conclusion: 该环境为深度研究工作流提供了可复现的评估框架，通过解耦组件和静态数据支持各阶段精准分析，推动复杂信息需求处理能力的标准化测评

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models have advanced from single-turn question answering to deep research workflows that iteratively plan queries, invoke external tools, and synthesize information to address complex information needs. Evaluating such workflows presents a fundamental challenge: reliance on live APIs introduces non-determinism, as tool invocations may yield different results across runs due to temporal drift, rate limiting, and evolving backend states. This variance undermines reproducibility and invalidates cross-system comparisons.
  We present ScholarGym, a simulation environment for reproducible evaluation of deep research workflows on academic literature. The environment decouples workflow components into query planning, tool invocation, and relevance assessment, enabling fine-grained analysis of each stage under controlled conditions. Built on a static corpus of 570K papers with deterministic retrieval, ScholarGym provides 2,536 queries with expert-annotated ground truth. Experiments across diverse backbone models reveal how reasoning capabilities, planning strategies, and selection mechanisms interact over iterative refinement.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are a major focus of recent AI research. However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding. We release SONIC-O1 for reproducibility and research: Project page: https://vectorinstitute.github.io/sonic-o1/ Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/vector-institute/sonic-o1 Github: https://github.com/vectorinstitute/sonic-o1 Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/vector-institute/sonic-o1-leaderboard

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 针对多模态大模型微调服务中的后门攻击风险，本文提出TCAP无监督防御框架，通过分析系统指令、视觉输入和用户查询三组件间的注意力分配异常来识别 poisoned 样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FTaaS在定制MLLM时引入后门风险，现有防御依赖监督信号或无法泛化到不同触发类型和模态。

Method: 提出Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP)：分解交叉注意力图为三组件，用GMM统计建模识别触发器响应的注意力头，通过EM算法投票聚合隔离 poisoned 样本。

Result: 在多种MLLM架构和攻击方法上表现优异，展现出强大的防御性能。

Conclusion: TCAP为MLLM提供了一种鲁棒且实用的无监督后门防御方案。

Abstract: Fine-Tuning-as-a-Service (FTaaS) facilitates the customization of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) but introduces critical backdoor risks via poisoned data. Existing defenses either rely on supervised signals or fail to generalize across diverse trigger types and modalities. In this work, we uncover a universal backdoor fingerprint-attention allocation divergence-where poisoned samples disrupt the balanced attention distribution across three functional components: system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries, regardless of trigger morphology. Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods demonstrate that TCAP achieves consistently strong performance, establishing it as a robust and practical backdoor defense in MLLMs.

*Tongxi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer (FBS) with three novel modules (PAW, CH, SG) to accelerate LLM inference by mimicking human reading patterns, improving efficiency without adding parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM inference relies on slow token-by-token autoregressive processing. Existing acceleration methods are superficial patches that lack core human-reading capabilities: adaptive foresight, chunk-aware computation, and train-test consistency for previewing/skimming.

Method: FBS injects a causal, trainable loop into Transformers using three components: (1) Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW) for content-adaptive foresight, (2) Chunk-Head (CH) for chunk-structure-aware compute allocation, and (3) Skip-Gate (SG) for train-test consistency in preview/skimming.

Result: Across diverse benchmarks, FBS improves the quality-efficiency trade-off without increasing model parameters. Ablation studies confirm the three modules are complementary.

Conclusion: The proposed FBS architecture effectively accelerates LLM inference by incorporating human-like reading mechanisms, achieving better efficiency while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across many tasks, yet inference is still dominated by strictly token-by-token autoregression. Existing acceleration methods largely patch this pipeline and miss core human-reading ingredients: content-adaptive foresight, chunk-structure-aware compute allocation, and train--test consistency for preview/skimming. We propose the \textbf{Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer} (FBS), which injects a causal, trainable loop into Transformers via Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW), Chunk-Head (CH), and Skip-Gate (SG). Across diverse benchmarks, FBS improves the quality-efficiency trade-off without increasing parameters, and ablations show the three modules are complementary.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: E-mem is a novel memory framework for LLM agents that shifts from preprocessing to episodic context reconstruction, preserving full context integrity through a hierarchical agent architecture, achieving 54% F1 (7.75% improvement) and 70% token cost reduction on LoCoMo benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization by compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures, severing the contextual integrity essential for System 2 reasoning (deliberative, high-precision problem-solving).

Method: E-mem framework inspired by biological engrams, using a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts while a central master agent orchestrates global planning, enabling local reasoning within activated segments and context-aware evidence extraction before aggregation.

Result: Achieves over 54% F1 score on the LoCoMo benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75% while reducing token cost by over 70%.

Conclusion: E-mem successfully preserves contextual integrity for deep reasoning, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency over traditional memory compression methods for System 2 reasoning in LLM agents.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents towards System~2 reasoning, characterized by deliberative, high-precision problem-solving, requires maintaining rigorous logical integrity over extended horizons. However, prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization. By compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures (e.g., embeddings or graphs), these methods sever the contextual integrity essential for deep reasoning. To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction. Inspired by biological engrams, E-mem employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts, while a central master agent orchestrates global planning. Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation. Evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that E-mem achieves over 54\% F1, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75\%, while reducing token cost by over 70\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统中的个体智能体缺乏鲁棒性，容易盲目跟从误导性同伴，这源于迎合倾向和评估同伴可信度能力的不足。

Method: 形式化历史感知的参考学习问题，开发 ECL 框架：基于历史交互构建明确的同伴画像来调节预测，并通过带辅助奖励的强化学习进行优化。

Result: ECL 使 Qwen 3-4B 小模型超越 8 倍大的 Qwen 3-30B 基线；前沿模型性能接近 100%；泛化至多智能体配置；信任建模准确率与最终答案质量高度相关。

Conclusion: 利用历史交互评估同伴可信度能有效提升多智能体鲁棒性，且 LLM 的信任建模能力与系统性能强相关，表明该方法高效且泛化性强。

Abstract: Individual agents in multi-agent (MA) systems often lack robustness, tending to blindly conform to misleading peers. We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance. We show that ECL generalizes well to various MA configurations and we find that trust is modeled well by LLMs, revealing a strong correlation in trust modeling accuracy and final answer quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional supervised climate downscaling struggles to generalize across Global Climate Models due to lack of paired training data and domain gaps, while existing zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues under large scaling factors.

Method: Proposes Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD) framework that learns a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior from reanalysis data conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information, plus Unified Coordinate Guidance to address vanishing gradients and ensure large-scale field consistency.

Result: ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and successfully reconstructs complex weather events like tropical cyclones across heterogeneous GCMs.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust zero-shot climate downscaling without paired data by enforcing physical validity through learned priors and coordinate guidance, effectively addressing generalization challenges across different climate models.

Abstract: Conventional supervised climate downscaling struggles to generalize to Global Climate Models (GCMs) due to the lack of paired training data and inherent domain gaps relative to reanalysis. Meanwhile, current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues under large scaling factors. We propose Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD), a zero-shot framework that performs statistical downscaling without paired data during training. ZSSD leverages a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information to enforce physical validity. Furthermore, to enable robust inference across varying GCMs, we introduce Unified Coordinate Guidance. This strategy addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla DPS and ensures consistency with large-scale fields. Results show that ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and successfully reconstructs complex weather events, such as tropical cyclones, across heterogeneous GCMs.

Abstract: We present a conceptual space framework for modelling abstract concepts that unfold over time, demonstrated through a chess-based proof-of-concept. Strategy concepts, such as attack or sacrifice, are represented as geometric regions across interpretable quality dimensions, with chess games instantiated and analysed as trajectories whose directional movement toward regions enables recognition of intended strategies. This approach also supports dual-perspective modelling, capturing how players interpret identical situations differently. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory-based concept recognition, with movement patterns aligning with expert commentary. This work explores extending the conceptual spaces theory to temporally realised, goal-directed concepts. The approach establishes a foundation for broader applications involving sequential decision-making and supports integration with knowledge evolution mechanisms for learning and refining abstract concepts over time.

Abstract: Endotracheal suctioning (ES) is an invasive yet essential clinical procedure that requires a high degree of skill to minimize patient risk - particularly in home care and educational settings, where consistent supervision may be limited. Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements. Collectively, these contributions establish a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a cost-effective, highly accessible and widely employed diagnostic tool. With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.

Conclusion: 该框架将需求预测与库存管理关联起来，推动评估标准从纯预测精度转向运营相关性，适用于汽车售后市场及相关领域

Abstract: Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases that reinforce harmful stereotypes, limiting their safe deployment. Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces WebArbiter, a reasoning-first Web Process Reward Model that generates structured justifications for web navigation actions, trained via reasoning distillation and reinforcement learning, outperforming GPT-5 by 9.1 points on a new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web agents face challenges in long-horizon sequential decision-making with irreversible actions, where outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed. Existing WebPRMs are limited by coarse scalar signals or brittle checklist-based approaches that lack interpretability and fail under layout changes.

Method: The authors propose WebArbiter, which formulates reward modeling as text generation to produce structured justifications with preference verdicts. Training uses a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation for principle-guided reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning to correct teacher biases and align verdicts with correctness.

Result: On the newly released WebPRMBench benchmark, WebArbiter-7B outperforms GPT-5 by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points.

Conclusion: WebArbiter demonstrates robust performance and practical value for real-world complex web tasks, offering interpretable and generalizable reward modeling that enables better inference-time scaling for web agents.

Abstract: Web agents hold great potential for automating complex computer tasks, yet their interactions involve long-horizon, sequential decision-making with irreversible actions. In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points, underscoring its robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks.

### [67] [From Meta-Thought to Execution: Cognitively Aligned Post-Training for Generalizable and Reliable LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21909)
*Shaojie Wang,Liang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A cognitively-inspired two-stage framework (CoMT+CCRL) that separates abstract strategy learning from specific execution improves LLM reasoning by 2.19-4.63% while reducing training time 65-70% and token use 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFT+RL methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution—misaligned with human cognition that naturally decomposes problem-solving into meta-knowledge acquisition then instance adaptation.

Method: Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) for supervised learning of abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, followed by Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) using confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps to optimize task adaptation.

Result: Across four models and eight benchmarks: 2.19% in-distribution and 4.63% out-of-distribution improvement, 65-70% training time reduction, and 50% token consumption reduction versus standard methods.

Conclusion: Aligning LLM post-training with human cognitive principles by explicitly separating meta-strategy learning from execution yields superior generalization and significantly enhanced training efficiency.

Abstract: Current LLM post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\% and 4.63\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.

Conclusion: 细粒度过程监督能有效提升RAG推理性能，缓解过程幻觉。代码模型已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising paradigm for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in complex reasoning tasks. However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to "process hallucinations", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

*Yiqun Chen,Erhan Zhang,Tianyi Hu,Shijie Wang,Zixuan Yang,Meizhi Zhong,Xiaochi Wei,Yan Gao,Yi Wu,Yao Hu,Jiaxin Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JADE is a framework that jointly optimizes planning and execution in dynamic RAG workflows by modeling them as cooperative multi-agents with a shared backbone, solving the "strategic-operational mismatch" problem and achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems face a dichotomy: either optimize modules jointly within rigid architectures or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen black-box tools. This decoupled optimization creates a "strategic-operational mismatch" where sophisticated planning fails due to unadapted executors, often resulting in negative performance gains despite increased complexity.

Method: Proposes JADE (Joint Agentic Dynamic Execution), a unified framework that models the system as a cooperative multi-agent team under a single shared backbone. This enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards, facilitating co-adaptation where the planner learns executor capabilities while executors evolve to align with strategic intent.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements through joint optimization. It also enables flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness via dynamic workflow orchestration.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of planning and execution in dynamic RAG workflows is essential for performance, and JADE successfully achieves co-adaptation between planner and executors, demonstrating significant improvements over decoupled approaches.

Abstract: The evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shifted from static retrieval pipelines to dynamic, agentic workflows where a central planner orchestrates multi-turn reasoning. However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{JADE} (\textbf{J}oint \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体强化学习框架SCMA，通过分割和评分智能体选择性地惩罚冗余推理块，在减少11.1%-39%响应长度的同时提升4.33%-10.02%准确率，且部署无额外开销。


<details>

Motivation: 大推理模型的冗余推理导致推理开销，破坏交互体验并阻碍部署。现有基于强化学习的长度惩罚方案难以平衡简洁性与准确性，可能损害关键推理逻辑。

Method: 提出三智能体MARL框架：分割智能体将推理过程分解为逻辑块，评分智能体量化各块重要性，推理智能体接受重要性加权长度惩罚训练，以保留关键逻辑。

Result: 在多种模型规模上，响应长度减少11.1%-39.0%，准确率提升4.33%-10.02%；消融实验证实MARL协同优化产生涌现行为，优于传统RL范式。

Conclusion: 该框架通过选择性压缩冗余推理，实现了更高效准确的大推理模型，部署时无额外开销，展现了多智能体协同的优越性。

Abstract: The inference overhead induced by redundant reasoning undermines the interactive experience and severely bottlenecks the deployment of Large Reasoning Models. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\% to 39.0\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\% to 10.02\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.

TL;DR: 本文提出AgenticSimLaw，一个面向高风险表格决策任务的透明多智能体辩论框架。该框架采用法庭式角色结构（检察官、辩护律师、法官）和7轮结构化辩论，创建可审计的推理过程，在累犯预测任务上优于单智能体思维链方法，同时提供可解释性和控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险决策任务需要透明度和问责制，但当前大语言模型方法多为黑箱。需要在刑事司法等敏感领域实现可控、可审计的推理。

Method: AgenticSimLaw框架包括：角色结构化的多智能体辩论（检察官、辩护律师、法官）、7轮结构化辩论协议、私人推理策略、法庭式编排。在NLSY97青少年累犯预测数据集上测试，与思维链提示进行约90种模型/策略组合的对比。

Result: 比单智能体推理具有更稳定和可泛化的性能；准确率与F1分数指标间相关性更强；提供细粒度的推理步骤控制；生成完整的交互记录用于可解释性；支持智能体行为的系统化分析。

Conclusion: AgenticSimLaw成功解决了大语言模型多智能体系统的关键挑战（组织、可观测性、责任）。虽然在刑事司法领域实例化，但可推广至任何需要透明度和人类监督的审议性高风险决策任务，为黑箱方法提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeR2, a controlled sandbox to evaluate LLMs' genuine reasoning over novel scientific information by isolating reasoning from retrieval, revealing significant model limitations and headroom for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It's unclear if LLMs can reason over genuinely novel scientific information because existing evaluations conflate reasoning with retrieval/toolchain choices and are contaminated by parametric memorization and web volatility.

Method: DeR2 is a deep-research sandbox with four evidence-access regimes (Instruction-only, Concepts, Related-only, Full-set) to separate retrieval loss from reasoning loss. It uses two-phase validation to prevent parametric leakage and frozen document libraries from 2023-2025 theoretical papers with expert annotations.

Result: Experiments show substantial variation across models: some exhibit mode-switch fragility (worse performance with more information), while others show structural concept misuse (naming concepts but failing to execute them procedurally).

Conclusion: There is significant headroom in current model capabilities, and DeR2 enables fine-grained error attribution to distinguish retrieval failures from reasoning failures.

Abstract: Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolWeaver proposes hierarchical tool encoding to solve scalability and semantic limitations of token-based generative tool learning, using structured codes for logarithmic vocabulary growth and better collaborative pattern learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-based pipelines suffer from dual semantic challenges (weak retriever encoders + LLMs lacking tool knowledge), while generative methods using unique tokens face vocabulary explosion, poor generalization, and inability to learn tool relationships from sparse co-occurrences.

Method: Encodes tools into hierarchical sequences via a novel tokenization process that combines intrinsic tool semantics with extrinsic co-usage patterns, enabling logarithmic vocabulary expansion and dense co-occurrence learning of shared codes; integrates these via generative alignment fine-tuning.

Result: Evaluated on nearly 47,000 tools, ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scalability, generalizability, and semantic awareness for tool-augmented agents.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents by transforming tool learning through hierarchical encoding and collaborative pattern utilization.

Abstract: Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.

*Kuai Yu,Naicheng Yu,Han Wang,Rui Yang,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline to quantify how webpage visual attributes influence web-agent decision-making, revealing that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity strongly affect agent behavior while font styling and text color have minimal impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on web agents focuses on adversarial robustness and textual attributes, leaving a systematic understanding of how benign visual variations shape agent decision-making.

Method: VAF pipeline: (i) variant generation creating semantic-identical visual variants, (ii) browsing interaction via scrolling/clicking, (iii) evaluation using Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate across 8 variant families, 5 real-world websites, and 4 representative agents.

Result: Background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity significantly influence agent actions; font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.

Conclusion: Visual attributes substantially impact web agent decision-making, indicating a need for more robust agent designs that account for visual variations in real-world browsing scenarios.

Abstract: Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.

*Ilche Georgievski,Serhat Tekin,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how domain model characteristics in automated planning affect energy consumption, finding that domain-level modifications significantly impact energy usage independently of runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Green AI emphasizes energy efficiency, automated planning's energy consumption has been overlooked despite its computational demands. The modular separation between domain models and algorithms creates both a challenge and opportunity for systematic energy analysis.

Method: The authors developed a domain model configuration framework to manipulate features (element ordering, action arity, dead-end states) and empirically tested 5 benchmark domains × 5 state-of-the-art planners × 32 domain variants each to measure energy and runtime impacts.

Result: Domain-level modifications caused measurable energy differences across all planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime, suggesting separate optimization dimensions.

Conclusion: Energy efficiency in automated planning can be systematically influenced through domain model design, independent of algorithm selection, opening new avenues for Green AI in planning systems.

Abstract: AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL微调方法依赖预定义执行协议且需集中执行，而去中心化协作更具实践价值；蒙特卡洛方法方差高、样本效率低，演员-评论家方法能有效应对这些问题但尚未应用于去中心化LLM协作优化。

Method: 开发了多智能体演员-评论家(MAAC)框架，提出两种变体：集中式评论家的CoLLM-CC和去中心化评论家的CoLLM-DC，在写作、编程和游戏领域进行实验评估。

Result: 在短时序密集奖励任务中，蒙特卡洛方法和CoLLM-DC性能与CoLLM-CC相当；但在长时序或稀疏奖励任务中，蒙特卡洛方法需更多样本，CoLLM-DC难以收敛，均显著落后于CoLLM-CC。

Conclusion: 集中式评论家架构在复杂任务中更具优势，而去中心化评论家仅在简单场景下可行，为LLM多智能体协作的架构选择提供了重要依据。

Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

### [77] [Mind the Gap: How Elicitation Protocols Shape the Stated-Revealed Preference Gap in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21975)
*Pranav Mahajan,Ihor Kendiukhov,Syed Hussain,Lydia Nottingham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper shows that the correlation between what language models say they prefer and what they actually choose (SvR correlation) depends heavily on how preferences are elicited. Allowing models to say "neutral" or abstain improves correlation, but letting them abstain in choices reduces it. System prompts don't reliably fix this gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent work found a stated-revealed preference gap in LMs, but existing binary forced-choice methods conflate genuine preferences with protocol artifacts, making evaluations unreliable.

Method: Systematically tested how different elicitation protocols (allowing neutrality/abstention in stated preferences, abstention in revealed preferences, and system prompt steering) affect SvR correlation across 24 language models.

Result: Allowing neutrality in stated preferences improved Spearman's ρ correlation; allowing abstention in revealed preferences made ρ near-zero/negative due to high neutrality; system prompt steering did not reliably improve correlation on AIRiskDilemmas.

Conclusion: SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent, and reliable preference elicitation must account for indeterminate preferences rather than forcing binary choices.

Abstract: Recent work identifies a stated-revealed (SvR) preference gap in language models (LMs): a mismatch between the values models endorse and the choices they make in context. Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($ρ$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $ρ$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体育事件流数据（如足球赛事）存在事件顺序错乱、数据缺失等逻辑不一致问题，严重限制细粒度分析（如球员贡献量化、战术模式识别）的可靠性

Method: 构建基于状态转移模型的VERSA验证框架：1) 定义合法事件序列规则 2) 自动检测异常模式 3) 修正错误数据 4) 在K联赛2024赛季Bepro数据上测试有效性

Result: 1) 检测出18.81%的原始事件存在逻辑错误 2) 修复后数据跨供应商一致性显著提升 3) 下游VAEP球员评估任务性能与鲁棒性明显增强

Conclusion: 数据验证是提升体育分析可靠性的关键基础，VERSA为事件流数据质量保障提供了系统化解决方案，可推广至金融交易、系统运维等领域

Abstract: Event stream data is a critical resource for fine-grained analysis across various domains, including financial transactions, system operations, and sports. In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.

TL;DR: 提出"液态接口"新范式，通过运行时意图表达和语义协商实现自主智能体的自适应协调，解决传统静态接口与概率性推理不匹配的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件架构难以支持具有自适应、概率性和上下文依赖推理的自主智能体，而系统集成仍由静态接口和确定性合约主导，两者存在根本性不匹配

Method: 引入液态接口协调范式，将接口定义为短暂的关系事件而非持久技术构件，并形式化液态接口协议(LIP)来管理意图驱动交互、协商执行及语义不确定性下的短暂性

Result: 建立了液态接口的形式化模型，提出了LIP协议，探讨了其治理影响，并描述了证明其实用可行性的参考架构

Conclusion: 液态接口为基于智能体的系统中的自适应协调提供了原则性基础，能够有效支持自主智能体的动态协作需求

Abstract: Contemporary software architectures struggle to support autonomous agents whose reasoning is adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent, while system integration remains dominated by static interfaces and deterministic contracts. This paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a coordination paradigm in which interfaces are not persistent technical artifacts, but ephemeral relational events that emerge through intention articulation and semantic negotiation at runtime.We formalize this model and present the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP),which governs intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and enforce ephemerality under semantic uncertainty. We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility. Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems

TL;DR: 本文针对AI智能体推理暴露的内存墙等新瓶颈，提出操作强度(OI)和容量占用(CF)双指标分析框架，揭示经典roofline模型忽视的问题，并倡导解耦式服务与异构硬件架构创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体推理驱动的数据中心面临内存带宽、容量及互连瓶颈，传统roofline分析无法捕捉这些新挑战，亟需新的评估体系指导系统优化。

Method: 引入操作强度(OI)和容量占用(CF)两个新指标，联合分析不同智能体工作流(聊天/编程/网页/计算机使用)和模型架构(GQA/MLA/MoE/量化)下的性能特征。

Result: 发现OI/CF在不同场景下剧烈变化，长上下文KV缓存使解码高度内存受限，暴露内存墙问题，传统计算瓶颈分析存在盲区。

Conclusion: 结论是需采用解耦式服务、专用预填充/解码加速器、光I/O及内存 disaggregation 等异构方案，并推测智能体-硬件协同设计是适应动态OI/CF的关键路径。

Abstract: AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

TL;DR: Introduces CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating real-world LLM agent reliability in in-car assistants, revealing significant gaps in handling ambiguity and hallucinations despite advanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent benchmarks focus on idealistic task completion but neglect real-world reliability challenges like incomplete/ambiguous user requests in domains such as in-car voice assistants.

Method: Proposes CAR-bench featuring an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools. Evaluates agents via Hallucination tasks (testing limit-awareness with missing tools) and Disambiguation tasks (resolving uncertainty via clarification).

Result: Frontier LLMs achieve <50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information in Hallucination tasks.

Conclusion: Highlights critical need for more reliable, self-aware LLM agents capable of consistent real-world performance under uncertainty.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents focus on task completion under idealistic settings but overlook reliability in real-world, user-facing applications. In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.

Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，为复杂AI系统定义运行设计域(ODD)极具挑战性，特别是当数据已存在时。传统方法依赖早期专家知识，易导致环境描述不完整。现有数据驱动的后天ODD定义方法对于AI系统认证至关重要。

Method: 提出一种新颖的基于安全设计(Safety-by-Design)的方法，利用多维内核表示从已收集的数据中后天定义ODD。

Result: 通过蒙特卡洛方法和真实航空防撞案例验证了该方法的有效性；证明数据驱动的ODD可与数据原始潜在的真实ODD等效。

Conclusion: 该内核表示方法为数据驱动型安全关键AI系统的未来认证提供了可行的ODD定义方案，解决了现有数据场景下的认证难题。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the rise in many domains, including numerous safety-critical applications. However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data. Utilizing the novel, Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems.

TL;DR: 提出World of Workflows (WoW)企业环境及WoW-bench基准测试，揭示前沿大语言模型在企业复杂系统中存在"动态盲"问题，无法预测级联副作用，需要建立 grounded world modeling 新范式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有企业基准测试仅评估表面级任务完成，忽略了真实企业挑战：有限可观测性、大规模数据库状态和隐藏工作流的级联副作用，前沿LLMs在复杂企业系统中的表现尚未得到充分测试

Method: 构建基于ServiceNow的真实环境WoW，包含4000+业务规则和55个活跃工作流；创建WoW-bench基准测试集，包含234个任务，评估约束性智能体任务完成和企业动态建模能力

Result: 两大发现：(1)前沿LLMs存在"动态盲"，持续无法预测其行为的隐藏级联副作用，导致静默约束违规；(2)在不透明系统中，可靠性需要grounded world modeling，智能体必须心理模拟隐藏状态转换来弥补可观测性差距

Conclusion: WoW推动企业智能体新范式：需显式学习系统动态，通过grounded world modeling弥合可观测性鸿沟，才能实现可靠实用的企业智能体

Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.

TL;DR: Propose Agent-RRM, a multi-faceted reward model for agentic RL that provides structured feedback (reasoning trace, critique, score), and find Reagent-U integration strategy achieves strong results on GAIA (43.7%) and WebWalkerQA (46.2%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic RL methods rely on sparse outcome-based rewards that cannot assess intermediate reasoning quality, resulting in suboptimal training.

Method: Introduce Agent-RRM that generates structured feedback with three components: explicit reasoning trace, focused critique with refinement guidance, and overall performance score; investigate three integration strategies (Reagent-C, Reagent-R, Reagent-U).

Result: Reagent-U achieves substantial performance improvements, scoring 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA across 12 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed reasoning reward model and unified feedback integration scheme are effective, with code/models/datasets released to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has achieved notable success in enabling agents to perform complex reasoning and tool use. However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes. Code, models, and datasets are all released to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索超越传统无序或准周期无序驱动的Anderson局域化相变，通过推广Aubry-André模型研究任意正则共轭算符下的隐藏局域化行为。

Method: 将Aubry-André模型中的位置和动量算符替换为任意一对正则共轭算符，构建广义哈密顿量家族，并分析其波函数局域化特性。

Result: 发现系统存在隐藏的金属-绝缘体相变（波函数相对于其中一个共轭算符扩展/局域化）；当共轭算符是位置和动量的线性组合时，相变点对应位置空间归一化参与率为零；相变点哈密顿量等价于弯曲时空背景下的无质量狄拉克费米子晶格哈密顿量。

Conclusion: 揭示了多体局域化与类比引力理论之间的意外联系，表明特定无序系统中的量子相变可模拟弯曲时空中的相对论性粒子行为，为交叉领域研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Anderson localization is a phase transition between a metallic phase, where wavefunctions are extended and delocalized in space, and an insulating phase, where wavefunctions are completely localized. These transitions are driven by uncorrelated disorder or quasiperiodic disorder, e.g., in the case of the Aubry-André model. Here, I consider a family of Hamiltonians that generalizes the Aubry-André model obtained when position and momentum operators are replaced by an arbitrary couple of canonically conjugate operators. In these models, a hidden localization transition occurs between metallic/insulating phases with wavefunctions delocalized/localized with respect to one of the two canonically conjugate operators. If the canonically conjugate operators coincide with a linear combination of position and momentum, the phase transition is signaled by a zero in the normalized participation ratio in the usual position space. Surprisingly, I found that at the phase transition, this model Hamiltonian coincides with the lattice Hamiltonian of a massless Dirac fermion in a curved spacetime background, indicating an unexpected relation between many-body localization and analog gravity.

Result: 发现特定弦激发族导致U(1)对称观测量在猝灭后出现欠阻尼振荡，证实无能隙相中存在对称性保持的振幅模，并提出在易面量子磁体和量子模拟器中的实验探测方案

Conclusion: 量子猝灭可作为超越线性响应理论的有力工具，用于探测非常规集体激发，拓展了对量子多体系统非平衡动力学的理解

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of an amplitude (Higgs-like) mode in the gapless phase of the $(1+1)$D XXZ spin chain. Unlike conventional settings where amplitude modes arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking, here, we identify a symmetry-preserving underdamped excitation on top of a Luttinger-liquid ground state. Using nonequilibrium quench spectroscopy, we demonstrate that this mode manifests as oscillations of U(1)-symmetric observables following a sudden quench. By combining numerical simulations with Bethe-ansatz analyses, we trace its microscopic origin to specific families of string excitations. We further discuss experimental pathways to detect this mode in easy-plane quantum magnets and programmable quantum simulators. Our results showcase the utility of quantum quenches as a powerful tool to probe collective excitations, beyond the scope of linear response.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 该论文研究了张量积希尔伯特空间上的格点高阶对称性，发现低能下非紧致高阶对称性（如R和Z）通常保持非拓扑性，而紧致对称性（如Zn和U(1)）则趋于拓扑化，揭示了格点系统中对称性保护机制的拓扑与非拓扑行为差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究格点系统中高阶对称性在低能极限下的行为是否与相对论性量子场论中的拓扑高阶对称性一致，特别是非紧致对称性在格点模型中的稳定性问题。

Method: 构建具体格点模型（如R推广的Kitaev蜂窝模型和修正的环面码模型），结合低能有效场论分析，比较不同对称性（R 1-form与Z2 1-form）在低能下的拓扑性质及对外界扰动的鲁棒性。

Result: 1. R推广的Kitaev模型在低能下呈现具有非拓扑R 1-form对称性的无能隙非相对论性理论，该对称性易受局部扰动破坏；2. 修正环面码的Z2 1-form对称性在低能下趋于拓扑化（除非精细调节哈密顿量）；3. 提出多超选择 sectors下有效场论的构建规则；4. 证明非紧致高阶对称性格点系统低能下通常保持非拓扑性，而紧致对称性则趋于拓扑化。

Conclusion: 格点系统中高阶对称性的低能行为取决于其紧致性：非紧致对称性（如R/Z）无法形成受拓扑保护的鲁棒对称性，而紧致对称性（如Zn/U(1)）在低能下普遍演化为拓扑对称性，这对理解量子物质中对称性保护相具有重要意义。

Abstract: We study the lattice version of higher-form symmetries on tensor-product Hilbert spaces. Interestingly, at low energies, these symmetries may not flow to the topological higher-form symmetries familiar from relativistic quantum field theories, but instead to non-topological higher-form symmetries. We present concrete lattice models exhibiting this phenomenon. One particular model is an $\mathbb{R}$ generalization of the Kitaev honeycomb model featuring an $\mathbb{R}$ lattice 1-form symmetry. We show that its low-energy effective field theory is a gapless, non-relativistic theory with a non-topological $\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry. In both the lattice model and the effective field theory, we demonstrate that the non-topological $\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry is not robust against local perturbations. In contrast, we also study various modifications of the toric code and their low-energy effective field theories to demonstrate that the compact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice 1-form symmetry does become topological at low energies unless the Hamiltonian is fine-tuned. Along the way, we clarify the rules for constructing low-energy effective field theories in the presence of multiple superselection sectors. Finally, we argue on general grounds that non-compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ 1-form symmetries) in lattice systems generically remain non-topological at low energies, whereas compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and $U(1)$ 1-form symmetries) generically become topological.

Motivation: 二维toric code模型在保持Z₂自对偶对称性下形变时会出现连续相变至平庸态，但长期缺乏相应的连续场论描述，此工作旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 构建SO(4)₂,₋₂陈-西蒙斯-希格斯场论作为该相变的连续描述，并将其推广为整数k标记的SO(4)ₖ,₋ₖ理论系列，结合对偶性论证和数值结果验证。

Result: 该场论提供了相图的平均场理解；推广后的理论系列可描述不同非阿贝尔拓扑序（如k=3的双斐波那契序、k=4的S₃量子双）的类似相变；k=1情形被推测与3D Ising模型红外对偶。

Conclusion: 成功为toric code连续相变提供了场论框架，揭示了拓扑相变与对称性破缺相变之间的深刻联系，并建立了一类普适的理论系列。

Abstract: The toric code, when deformed in a way that preserves the self-duality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry exchanging the electric and magnetic excitations, admits a transition to a topologically trivial state that spontaneously breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Numerically, this transition was found to be continuous, which makes it particularly enigmatic given the longstanding absence of a continuum field-theoretic description. In this work we propose such a continuum field theory for the transition dubbed the $SO(4)_{2,-2}$ Chern-Simons-Higgs (CSH) theory. We show that our field theory provides a natural "mean-field" understanding of the phase diagram. Moreover, it can be generalized to an entire series of theories, namely the $SO(4)_{k,-k}$ CSH theories, labeled by an integer $k$. For each $k>2$, the theory describes an analogous transition involving different non-Abelian topological orders, such as the double Fibonacci order ($k=3$) and the $S_3$ quantum double ($k=4$). For $k=1$, we conjecture that the corresponding CSH transition is in fact infrared-dual to the $3d$ Ising transition, in close analogy with the particle-vortex duality of a complex scalar.

TL;DR: This paper challenges the assumption that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) always destabilizes supersolid phases in triangular-lattice magnets, discovering that thermal fluctuations can actually stabilize supersolidity at finite temperatures, leading to a complete phase diagram that includes skyrmion lattices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Revisit the common expectation that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) destabilizes spin supersolid phases in geometrically frustrated triangular-lattice magnets by gapping their low-energy modes, as this assumption may be incomplete.

Method: Used spin-wave theory and infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations to map out the SOC-field phase diagram of a frustrated triangular-lattice magnet.

Result: Found that while weak SOC drives zero-temperature instability by opening a gap, certain supersolid states remain thermodynamically stable at non-zero temperatures. Thermal fluctuations counteract SOC to stabilize supersolidity—a new mechanism. Finite-temperature supersolids retain key responses like giant magnetocaloric effect. At larger SOC, the system transitions to distinct magnetic orders including a skyrmion lattice, completing a unified phase diagram.

Conclusion: Revealed a previously unrecognized mechanism where thermal fluctuations can counteract SOC to stabilize supersolidity at finite temperatures, challenging conventional wisdom. The complete phase diagram shows potential relevance to real materials and expands understanding of quantum phases in frustrated magnets.

Abstract: Geometrically frustrated triangular-lattice magnets provide fertile ground for realizing intriguing quantum phases such as spin supersolids. A common expectation is that spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which breaks continuous spin rotational symmetry, destabilizes these phases by gapping their low-energy modes. Revisiting this assumption, we map out the SOC-field phase diagram of a frustrated triangular-lattice magnet using spin-wave theory and infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations. We find that while infinitesimally weak SOC indeed drives a zero-temperature instability of the supersolid by opening a gap, certain supersolid states remain thermodynamically stable at non-zero temperatures. This reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism in which thermal fluctuations counteract SOC to stabilize supersolidity. The resulting finite-temperature supersolids retain key responses, including a giant magnetocaloric effect, highlighting their potential relevance to real materials. At larger SOC, the system transitions into distinct magnetic orders, including a skyrmion lattice, completing a unified phase diagram.

Abstract: We have studied the magnetic properties of clinoatacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$, the parent compound of the quantum spin liquid candidate herbertsmithite and a longstanding puzzle among frustrated quantum magnets. As we reveal using density-functional theory, clinoatacamite belongs to the class of distorted kagome antiferromagnets with the kagome plane being embedded into a low-symmetry crystal structure. By means of thermodynamic measurements, muon spin rotation/relaxation as well as neutron diffraction on single crystals, we find a complex sequence of phases/regions below 18.1 K in zero magnetic field. We propose this complexity in multicritical clinoatacamite to arise from the competition of antiferromagnetic ordering modes from the underconstrained manifold of modes, which can lead to a metamagnetic texture in zero magnetic field.

Abstract: Recent works have suggested that transient suppression of a charge density wave (CDW) by an ultra-short excitation can lead to an inversion of the CDW phase. We experimentally investigate the dynamics of the CDW in K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$ by time resolved x-ray diffraction after excitation with optical pulses. Our results indicate a transient inversion of the CDW phase close to the surface that evolves into a highly disordered state in less than one picosecond. Numerical simulations solving the Ginzburg-Landau equation including disorder from strong pinning defects reproduce our main observations. Our findings highlight the critical role of disorder in schemes for coherent control in condensed matter systems.

Motivation: 量子临界金属中不同临界涨落与费米面耦合会产生丰富的非费米液体行为，但缺乏系统的分类框架来理解其普适的超导涨落特性，尤其需要解决费米动量在重正化群流中持续演化的问题。

Method: 提出"投影不动点"理论工具，将传统不动点推广为考虑费米动量持续演化的固定轨迹，通过分析投影不动点丛的拓扑结构，对非费米液体进行超普适类划分，并结合普适配对相互作用和涌现对称性进行次级分类。

Result: 1) 建立7个超普适类框架，每个类包含多个由配对相互作用和对称性决定的普适类；2) 发现部分非费米液体因激发不相干性和费米动量导致的无温标不变性可稳定至零温；3) 揭示超导转变温度下限和配对对称性由母金属普适数据决定；4) 在非s波不稳定性类别中，临界角动量对费米动量敏感且超导转变温度随密度振荡。

Conclusion: 投影不动点方法成功建立了非费米液体的系统分类体系，揭示了量子临界涨落诱导超导的普适规律，为理解量子临界材料中奇异超导现象提供了理论基础，特别强调了费米动量在非费米液体稳定性中的关键作用。

Abstract: In quantum critical metals, a plethora of different non-Fermi liquids arises depending on the nature of critical fluctuations coupled to Fermi surfaces. In this paper, we classify non-Fermi liquids that arise from q=0 critical fluctuations and characterize their universal superconducting fluctuations. The essential tool is the projective fixed points, which generalizes the notion of fixed points to fixed trajectories that take into account the incessant running of the Fermi momentum under the renormalization group flow. Based on the topology of bundles of projective fixed points, non-Fermi liquids are first grouped into seven superuniversality classes. Each superuniversality class includes multiple universality classes, which are further classified by the universal pairing interactions and emergent symmetries. Despite the pairing interaction generated by critical fluctuations, some non-Fermi liquids remain stable down to zero temperature due to the incoherence of excitations and the lack of scale invariance caused by Fermi momentum. Depending on the strength and span of the universal pairing interaction in momentum space, the emergent symmetry of non-Fermi liquids may or may not be lower than that of Fermi liquids. In non-Fermi liquids that become superconductors at low temperatures, the universal data of the parent metal determine the lower bound for the superconducting transition temperature and the associated pairing symmetry. In superuniversality classes that contain non-Fermi liquids prone to non-s-wave superconducting instabilities, the critical angular momentum above which pairing instability becomes inevitable is sensitive to the Fermi momentum, and the associated superconducting transition temperature oscillates as a function of the density. We use physical examples, as well as a toy model, to elucidate the universal low-energy physics of all superuniversality classes.

Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of the real-time Dyson expansion (RTDE) with established non-equilibrium Green's function approaches for simulating driven, interacting quantum systems. Focusing on density matrix dynamics, time-off-diagonal Green's functions, and time-resolved photoemission spectra, we benchmark RTDE against fully self-consistent Kadanoff-Baym equation (KBE) calculations, the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA), and exact diagonalization for small systems using second order many-body perturbation theory. Using a driven two-band Hubbard model, we show that mean-field single particle density matrix trajectories provide a reliable baseline for RTDE across a broad range of interaction strengths and excited-carrier populations. Further, RTDE accurately captures correlation effects in the Green's functions, including long-lived oscillations and revivals that are strongly suppressed by the overdamping inherent to self-consistent KBE schemes. As a consequence, RTDE resolves rich non-equilibrium spectral structure in time-resolved photoemission, such as interaction- and population-dependent quasiparticle splittings and bandgap renormalization, which are largely washed out in self-consistent approaches, yet are present in the exact solutions. Our results demonstrate that RTDE bridges the gap between mean-field propagation and full two-time KBE simulations, retaining favorable linear scaling while capturing essential dynamical correlations relevant for ultrafast spectroscopy.

Abstract: Type-II semi-Dirac fermions in two dimensions have been proposed to describe topologically nontrivial low energy excitations in titanium/vanadium oxide heterostructures. These quasiparticles appear at the merger of three Dirac cones, resulting in a non-zero Berry phase. We find, by employing Hartree-Fock, renormalization group and RPA techniques, that the spectrum is very sensitive to long-range electron-electron interactions and can undergo a profound transformation. Specifically the quasiparticle spectrum evolves, driven by interactions, from anisotropic Dirac dispersion at the lowest energies, towards the characteristic type-II semi-Dirac boomerang shape as the energy increases. The corresponding density of states varies between linear and power one third ($ρ(\varepsilon) \sim |\varepsilon| \rightarrow |\varepsilon|^{1/3}$). The crossover scale is controlled by the interaction strength $α= e^2/(\hbar v)$, and the specifics of the effective interacting Hamiltonian. Our results imply that various physical characteristics exhibit critical behavior with continuously varying 'critical exponents'; for example Landau levels in a magnetic field vary with the energy scale: $|\varepsilon_n(B)|\sim (nB)^{1/2} \rightarrow (nB)^{3/4}, n=0,1,2,...$, and similarly for other observables.

Abstract: Interaction quenches in strongly correlated electron systems provide a powerful route to probe nonequilibrium many-body dynamics. For the Hubbard model, nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory has revealed coherent post-quench oscillations, dynamical crossovers, and long-lived transient regimes. However, these studies are largely restricted to spatially homogeneous dynamics and therefore neglect the role of spatial structure formation during ultrafast evolution. Here we investigate interaction quenches in the half-filled Hubbard model using a real-space time-dependent Gutzwiller framework. We show that homogeneous nonequilibrium dynamics is generically unstable: even arbitrarily weak spatial fluctuations grow dynamically and drive the system toward intrinsically inhomogeneous states. Depending on the interaction strength, the post-quench evolution exhibits spatial differentiation, nucleation, and slow coarsening of Mott-like domains. Our results establish spatial self-organization as a generic feature of far-from-equilibrium correlated matter and reveal a fundamental limitation of spatially homogeneous nonequilibrium theories.

Abstract: We investigate a single magnetic impurity in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling and single-ion anisotropy. We show that at sufficiently strong coupling there exists a finite temperature window, before the moment is completely screened, where the magnetic anisotropy of the system flips: the hard-axis becomes the easy-axis or vice versa. We derive this rigorously for a single impurity using numerical renormalization group calculations as well as Nozieres' strong-coupling limit and discuss its relevance to heavy-fermion compounds which order magnetically along the hard-direction. We show that the coexistence of Curie-like response and Kondo fluctuations is stabilized along the initially hard direction leading to the anisotropy switch.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of quantum circuit fidelity across the full compilation stack, from high-level gate optimization through pulse-level control. Using a modular integration framework connecting a C++ circuit optimizer with Lindblad-based pulse simulation, we systematically evaluate the fidelity impact of four optimization passes: gate cancellation, commutation, rotation merging, and identity elimination, on IQM Garnet hardware parameters. Our simulation campaign spanning 371 circuit runs reveals that gate cancellation provides the most significant improvement (68\% of circuits improved, 14,024 gates eliminated), while pulse duration exhibits the strongest negative correlation with process fidelity ($r = -0.74$, $R^2 = 0.55$). We validate these findings through hardware execution on the IQM Resonance Garnet 20-qubit processor, demonstrating 70\% gate reduction on QFT circuits with 100\% job success rate (8 executions). Our open-source framework enables reproducible benchmarking of quantum compilation pipelines.

Abstract: Wave particle duality remains a central interpretational challenge in quantum theory. In this work, we develop a trajectory-based description of photon dynamics formulated in an extended complex space within the relativistic quantum Hamilton Jacobi framework. In this approach, photon motion is represented by complex trajectories whose real projections describe propagation, while imaginary components encode oscillatory structure. We show that momentum eigenstates correspond to straight line trajectories with uniform propagation at the speed of light, whereas superposition states lead to nontrivial quantum potentials and oscillatory motion in the complex plane. Extending the analysis to complex two dimensional space reveals richer dynamical behavior, including propagating wave like trajectories and standing wave like patterns in real projections. Energy momentum consistency is verified through an internal coherence analysis based on projected standing wave wavelengths. Rather than introducing new dynamical laws or additional physical dimensions, the complex space is employed as an interpretational framework that renders wave like and particle like aspects as complementary projections of a single underlying motion. The results suggest a unified geometric perspective on wave particle duality, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Eigenvalues of the Breit equation, in which only the static Coulomb potential is considered, have been found. Over the past decades several authors have analyzed the Breit equation to obtain numerically or by approximation an estimation of the energy levels. Various approaches have been used and no determination of the energy levels currently exists that is directly based on the second order Heun differential equation derived.
  The aim of this work is to provide a method of calculation that can be used to numerically calculate the energy levels for various spin states to high accuracy.
  From the Breit equation, we derive the corresponding second-order Heun differential equation and continued fraction from which the eigenvalues can be determined very accurately. Next, we present a novel method based on the Green function method, which leads to a semi-infinite determinant from which we are able to obtain the numerical values of the eigenvalues by direct calculation.
  Using suitable numerical methods for the direct calculation of the continued fraction and the semi-infinite determinant, we show that both methods are consistent within 25 digits of accuracy. We show that the correct energy levels for the Dirac equation follow from our results by a suitable mapping of the variables.
  The results are in total agreement with earlier calculations found in the literature and extend this by several digits of additional accuracy. The condition on the determinant giving the energy levels provides a rich structure that is promising in extending the results of this work.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel dispatch formulation for micro-mobility vehicles using a Quantum Annealer (QA). In recent years, QA has gained increasing attention as a high-performance solver for combinatorial optimization problems. Meanwhile, micro-mobility services have been rapidly developed as a promising means of realizing efficient and sustainable urban transportation. In this study, the dispatch problem for such micro-mobility services is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling efficient solving through QA. Furthermore, the proposed formulation incorporates historical usage data to enhance operational efficiency. Specifically, customer arrival frequencies and destination distributions are modeled into the QUBO formulation through a Bayesian approach, which guides the allocation of vacant vehicles to designated stations for waiting and charging. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with comparisons to conventional formulations such as the vehicle routing problem. Additionally, the performance of QA is compared with that of classical solvers to reveal its potential advantages for the proposed dispatch formulation. The effect of reverse annealing on improving solution quality is also investigated.

TL;DR: This paper derives the classical limit of quantum master equations with double-bracket dissipators using phase-space methods, revealing gradient-flow dynamics and quantum-classical correspondence in dephasing and non-Hermitian systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish the classical limit of open quantum systems governed by double-bracket dissipators (double commutators for dephasing and double anticommutators for noisy non-Hermitian Hamiltonians), bridging quantum dynamics with classical phase-space evolution and addressing implications for quantum-classical correspondence.

Method: Formulates open quantum dynamics in phase space via Wigner functions and Moyal products, performs systematic ħ-expansion to isolate classical contributions, constructs gradient-flow representations for dynamics, and validates using harmonic/driven anharmonic oscillators with classical/nonclassical initial states via observables and Wigner logarithmic negativity.

Result: Successfully obtains classical limits for both double-commutator (energy diffusion) and double-anticommutator (noisy non-Hermitian) dissipators; demonstrates gradient-flow structure in classical dynamics; shows harmonic oscillators exhibit exact classical correspondence while anharmonic systems reveal quantum corrections; quantifies quantumness decay via Wigner negativity evolution.

Conclusion: The classical limit of double-bracket master equations yields gradient-flow dynamics with clear quantum-classical correspondence, extending to higher-order nested brackets for spectral filtering applications, providing a unified framework for analyzing decoherence and non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems.

Abstract: We investigate the classical limit of quantum master equations featuring double-bracket dissipators. Specifically, we consider dissipators defined by double commutators, which describe dephasing dynamics, as well as dissipators involving double anticommutators, associated with fluctuating anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The classical limit is obtained by formulating the open quantum dynamics in phase space using the Wigner function and Moyal products, followed by a systematic $\hbar$-expansion. We begin with the well-known model of energy dephasing, associated with energy diffusion. We then turn to master equations containing a double anticommutator with the system Hamiltonian, recently derived in the context of noisy non-Hermitian systems. For both classes of double-bracket equations, we provide a gradient-flow representation of the dynamics. We analyze the classical limit of the resulting evolutions for harmonic and driven anharmonic quantum oscillators, considering both classical and nonclassical initial states. The dynamics is characterized through the evolution of several observables as well as the Wigner logarithmic negativity. We conclude by extending our analysis to generalized master equations involving higher-order nested brackets, which provide a time-continuous description of spectral filtering techniques commonly used in the numerical analysis of quantum systems.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant logical entangling gates are essential for scalable quantum computing, but are limited by the error rates and overheads of physical two-qubit gates and measurements. To address this limitation, we introduce phantom codes-quantum error-correcting codes that realize entangling gates between all logical qubits in a code block purely through relabelling of physical qubits during compilation, yielding perfect fidelity with no spatial or temporal overhead. We present a systematic study of such codes. First, we identify phantom codes using complementary numerical and analytical approaches. We exhaustively enumerate all $2.71 \times 10^{10}$ inequivalent CSS codes up to $n=14$ and identify additional instances up to $n=21$ via SAT-based methods. We then construct higher-distance phantom-code families using quantum Reed-Muller codes and the binarization of qudit codes. Across all identified codes, we characterize other supported fault-tolerant logical Clifford and non-Clifford operations. Second, through end-to-end noisy simulations with state preparation, full QEC cycles, and realistic physical error rates, we demonstrate scalable advantages of phantom codes over the surface code across multiple tasks. We observe a one-to-two order-of-magnitude reduction in logical infidelity at comparable qubit overhead for GHZ-state preparation and Trotterized many-body simulation tasks, given a modest preselection acceptance rate. Our work establishes phantom codes as a viable architectural route to fault-tolerant quantum computation with scalable benefits for workloads with dense local entangling structure, and introduces general tools for systematically exploring the broader landscape of quantum error-correcting codes.

Conclusion: 局域相干驱动是调控开放量子系统、产生宏观序的有效手段，为在非平衡条件下实现量子相变提供了新思路。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary-localized periodic (Floquet) drive can induce nontrivial long-range correlations in a non-interacting fermionic chain which is additionally subject to boundary dissipation. Surprisingly, we find that this phenomenon occurs even when the corresponding isolated bulk is in a trivial gapped phase with exponentially decaying correlations. We argue that this boundary-drive induced non-equilibrium transition (as witnessed through the correlation matrix) is driven by a resonance mechanism whereby the drive frequency bridges bulk energy gaps, allowing boundary-injected particles and holes to propagate and mediate long-range correlations into the bulk. We also numerically establish that when the drive bridges a particle-hole gap, the induced long-range order scales as a power law with the bulk pairing potential ($χ\sim γ^2$). Our results highlight the potential of localized coherent driving for generating macroscopic order in open quantum systems.

TL;DR: This paper develops a 2D mathematical model of nanodiamond dynamics in an inverted harmonic potential based on Stern-Gerlach interferometry, deriving rotational motion equations (libration, precession, rotation) to enable macroscopic quantum superposition creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more realistic and accurate depiction of nanoparticle dynamics in linear and inverted harmonic potentials by incorporating two-dimensional spatial and rotational degrees of freedom, which is crucial for creating stable macroscopic quantum spatial superpositions.

Method: Uses Stern-Gerlach Interferometer scheme with linear/quadratic magnetic fields to generate harmonic and non-linear potentials. Develops mathematical model including 2D dynamics and derives equations of motion for rotational degrees of freedom (libration, precession, rotation).

Result: Adding magnetic-field bias affects classical equations of motion but not wave packet width. Libration mode forms stable harmonic potential because initial angular velocity is dominated by nanoparticle's defect axis, making it stable against trap frequency in orthogonal direction.

Conclusion: The stable libration mode enables creation of macroscopic quantum superposition, providing a more realistic framework for nanoparticle quantum dynamics in inverted harmonic potentials.

Abstract: This study presents a mathematical model of the spatial and rotational motion of a nanodiamond in an inverted harmonic potential to create a macroscopic quantum spatial superposition. The model is based on the Stern-Gerlach Interferometer (SGI) scheme, which utilises linear and quadratic magnetic fields to generate a harmonic potential (linear magnetic field) and a non-linear potential (non-linear/quadratic magnetic field). By incorporating two-dimensional dynamics into the model, we provide a more realistic and accurate depiction of nanoparticle dynamics in linear and inverted harmonic potentials and explore the interaction between motion in a two-dimensional plane. Importantly, we derive the equations of motion for the rotational degrees of freedom, i.e. libration, precession, and rotation. The results show that adding a magnetic-field bias term to the magnetic-field profile in the linear stage affects the classical equations of motion but does not affect the width of the wave packet. Moreover, the libration mode always forms a harmonic potential at each stage because the applied initial angular velocity is dominated by the nanoparticle's defect axis, making it more stable in the presence of the trap frequency in the orthogonal direction along the axis that enables the creation of a macroscopic quantum superposition.

Abstract: We propose a framework for preparing quantum states with a holographic entanglement structure, in the sense that the entanglement entropies are governed by minimal surfaces in a chosen bulk geometry. We refer to such entropies as holographic because they obey a relation between entropies and bulk minimal surfaces, known as the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, that is a key feature of holographic models of quantum gravity. Typically in such models, the bulk geometry is determined by solving Einstein's equations. Here, we simply choose a bulk geometry, then discretize the geometry into a coupling graph comprising bulk and boundary nodes. Evolving under this graph of interactions and measuring the bulk nodes leaves behind the desired pure state on the boundary. We numerically demonstrate that the resulting entanglement properties approximately reproduce the predictions of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in the chosen bulk geometry. We consider graphs associated with hyperbolic disk and wormhole geometries, but the approach is general. The minimal ingredients in our proposal involve only Gaussian operations and measurements and are readily implementable in photonic and cold-atom platforms.

Abstract: Quantum metrology involves the application of quantum resources to enhance measurements. Several communities have developed quantum-metrology strategies that leverage effective time reversals. These strategies, we posit, form four classes. First, echo metrology begins with a preparatory unitary and ends with that unitary's time-reverse. The protocol amplifies the visibility of a small parameter to be sensed. Similarly, weak-value amplification enhances a weak coupling's detectability. The technique exhibits counterintuitive properties captured by a retrocausal model. Using the third strategy, one simulates closed timelike curves, worldlines that loop back on themselves in time. The fourth strategy involves indefinite causal order, which characterises channels applied in a superposition of orderings. We review these four strategies, which we unify under the heading of time-reverse metrology. We also outline opportunities for this toolkit in quantum metrology; quantum information science; quantum foundations; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; and solid-state physics.

TL;DR: Demonstrated universal topological quantum computation using the simplest non-Abelian phase (S₃ group) on a 54-qubit quantum processor by combining anyon braiding with fusion measurements, enabling magic state preparation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simple non-Abelian topological orders (like generalizations of toric code) lack universal quantum computation via braiding alone; this work aims to achieve universality by leveraging anyon fusion as a computational primitive.

Method: Prepared a 54-qubit topological wavefunction based on the smallest non-Abelian group (S₃) on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor, using cyclic anyon fusion rules to trap non-Abelian anyons and combining braiding operations with charge measurements.

Result: Achieved a universal topological gate set for logical qutrits, demonstrated magic state preparation, and evidenced cyclic fusion rules by trapping a single non-Abelian anyon on the torus.

Conclusion: S₃ topological order is both experimentally efficient to prepare and sufficiently rich to enable universal topological quantum computation, advancing practical fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: Topological quantum computation encodes quantum information in the internal fusion space of non-Abelian anyonic quasiparticles, whose braiding implements logical gates. This goes beyond Abelian topological order (TO) such as the toric code, as its anyons lack internal structure. However, the simplest non-Abelian generalizations of the toric code do not support universality via braiding alone. Here we demonstrate that such minimally non-Abelian TOs can be made universal by treating anyon fusion as a computational primitive. We prepare a 54-qubit TO wavefunction associated with the smallest non-Abelian group, $S_3$, on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor. This phase of matter exhibits cyclic anyon fusion rules, known to underpin universality, which we evidence by trapping a single non-Abelian anyon on the torus. We encode logical qutrits in the nonlocal fusion space of non-Abelian fluxes and, by combining an entangling braiding operation with anyon charge measurements, realize a universal topological gate set and read-out, which we further demonstrate by topologically preparing a magic state. This work establishes $S_3$ TO as simple enough to be prepared efficiently, yet rich enough to enable universal topological quantum computation.

TL;DR: Using photon counts as feedback error signal for quantum polarization stabilization in optical fibers enables more precise Zeno protective measurements by reducing background noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve active polarization stabilization necessary for Zeno protective measurements of quantum states, requiring improved signal-to-noise ratio over classical reference methods.

Method: Coupled quantum polarization to temporal pointer (arrival time) in birefringent fiber; implemented two feedback schemes: one using photon counts as error signal, another using classical reference beam.

Result: Photon-count method showed higher signal levels, significantly reduced background noise, increased Zeno stages from 9 to 13, and decreased measurement uncertainty.

Conclusion: Self-referenced stabilization via photon counts outperforms classical reference methods, enabling higher-precision quantum state measurements through extended Zeno stages.

Abstract: We have performed Zeno protective measurements of quantum polarization states by coupling the polarization to a temporal pointer (arrival time) in a birefringent optical fiber. It is necessary to actively stabilize the polarization, and we do this by using the signal photon counts themselves as the error signal in a feedback loop. We compare these measurements to a stabilization scheme using a classical reference beam as the error signal. The method using photon counts has higher signal levels and significantly reduced background. These improvements allow us to increase the number of Zeno stages in our measurements from 9 to 13, with a corresponding decrease in the measurement uncertainty.

Conclusion: 建立运动效应分析基础框架，为量子计算/精密测量等应用提供理论支撑，并开辟利用声子调控的新实验路径

Abstract: Subwavelength arrays of atoms trapped in optical lattices or tweezers are inherently susceptible to deformations: Optomechanical forces produce lattice distortions, which, in turn, modify the optical response of the array. We show that this coupling hybridizes collective atomic excitations (polaritons) with phonons, forming polaron-polaritons -- the fundamental quasiparticles governing light-matter interactions in arrays of trapped atoms. Using analytical polaron theory and numerical simulations, we show that: (1) phonons can strongly enhance the decay of subradiant states, but also enable their efficient excitation; (2) transport of dark excitations remains remarkably robust even at low trap frequencies, except when a polariton can resonantly scatter phonons; and (3) motion reduces the reflectivity of a two-dimensional atomic mirror, however, we identify mechanisms that mitigate this degradation and restore reflectivity above 99% in some cases. Our findings lay the foundation for analyzing motional effects in key applications and suggest new ways to harness them in state-of-the-art experiments.

In this work, we compute the number of particles produced via the dynamical Casimir effect in an ideal cavity, where one of the mirrors is allowed to move under the influence of a gravitational wave. Assuming an oscillatory mirror motion and a plane gravitational wave, we identify the resonance conditions that lead to an exponential increase in the number of created particles through parametric amplification.

Abstract: We realize a nanoscale accelerometer exploiting the nonequilibrium dynamics of a nanoparticle near the quantum ground state. We explore the dynamics after quenching the trapping potential and find that rapid quenching provides an instance at which the sensitivity is enhanced due to the minimized uncertainty in the position. With rapid quenching, the observed sensitivity is in good agreement with a numerical simulation based on the quantum Langevin equation and approaches to the limit given by the quantum Fisher information. Our results open up a pathway to quantum inertial sensing sensitized by exploiting quench dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究无通信智能体如何对未观测场进行动作协调，对理解分散系统具有重要意义。核心挑战在于分离相关几何与收益优化，揭示量子纠缠在实现与经典方法本质不同的协调机制中的作用。

Method: 开发具有相同信息访问和无信号约束的HFC模型，运用信息论诊断工具对比分析经典共享随机性基线与采用多体W态及自发领导者选举的量子策略。

Result: 经典策略增加相关性主要通过动作对齐（复制）实现，导致碰撞增加；而量子策略在保持全局依赖的同时将碰撞降至独立基线以下，形成几何分离——经典策略概率集中于对角线（动作相等），量子策略则占据偏移对角线区域（关系角色）。纠缠特征体现为依赖几何的改变而非相关强度的提升。

Conclusion: 量子纠缠通过改变联合动作分布的几何结构，实现了支持稳健反协调的新机制，挑战了"量子优势源于更高相关强度"的传统认知。

Abstract: We study decentralized multi-agent coordination where agents must correlate actions against an unobserved field and cannot communicate. To isolate correlation geometry from payoff optimization, we introduce the Hidden-Field Coordination (HFC) model, which enforces identical information access and no-signaling constraints across strategies. Using information-theoretic diagnostics, we compare classical shared-randomness baselines with an entanglement-mediated strategy based on multipartite W states and a strictly local Spontaneous Leader Election rule. Within the restricted symmetric shared-latent baseline studied here, increasing total correlation is achieved primarily by driving actions toward alignment (copying), which also increases pairwise coincidence (collisions). By contrast, the quantum strategy realizes a collision-suppressing coordination regime: it preserves global dependence while reducing pairwise coincidence below the independent (product) baseline induced by the common marginal distribution. This produces a geometric separation in the joint-action distribution. Classical baselines concentrate probability near the diagonal of action equality, whereas the entanglement-mediated mapping occupies an offset-diagonal region associated with relational roles. Accordingly, the entanglement signature in this setting is not higher correlation magnitude; total-correlation differentials can be negative relative to the classical copying optimum. Instead, it reflects a change in dependence geometry that supports robust anti-coordination.

Abstract: We study the extraction of quantum coherence by three static Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors that interact locally with a massless scalar vacuum field in the vicinity of an infinite perfectly reflecting boundary. Depending on the setup, the detectors are positioned either parallel or orthogonal to the boundary, with their energy gaps chosen to satisfy the hierarchy $Ω_C\geq Ω_B\geq Ω_A$. Our analysis reveals that decreasing the detector-boundary separation leads to a monotonic degradation of quantum coherence, whereas the same boundary effect can simultaneously preserve and even amplify the harvested quantum entanglement. Moreover, when the detectors possess distinct energy gaps, coherence extraction is further inhibited; strikingly, such non-identical configurations substantially enhance the efficiency of entanglement harvesting and markedly extend the range of detector separations over which non-negligible entanglement can be generated. Nevertheless, the harvesting of nonlocal quantum coherence is achievable over a significantly broader range of detector separations than that of quantum entanglement. Despite exhibiting similar overall behavior, orthogonal detector configurations outperform parallel ones in coherence harvesting, highlighting the quantitative influence of detector geometry. Overall, our study reveals a hierarchical distinction between quantum coherence and entanglement as operational resources in structured vacuum fields: quantum coherence is not only more readily accessible across space but also more robust than entanglement, whereas entanglement exhibits richer features and can be selectively activated and enhanced through boundary effects and detector non-uniformity.

Abstract: Photons are among the most important carriers of quantum information owing to their rich degrees of freedom (DoFs), including various spatiotemporal structures. The ability to characterize these DoFs, as well as the hidden correlations among them, directly determines whether they can be exploited for quantum tasks. While various methods have been developed for measuring the spatiotemporal structure of classical light fields, owing to the technical challenges posed by weak photon flux, there have so far been no reports of observing such structures in their quantum counterparts, except for a few studies limited to correlations within individual DoFs. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a self-referenced, high-efficiency, and all-optical method, termed 3D imaging of photonic wave packets, for comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal structure of a quantum light field, i.e., the biphoton spatiotemporal wave packet. Benefiting from this developed method, we successfully observe the spatial-spatial, spectral-spectral, and spatiotemporal correlations of biphotons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, revealing rich local and nonlocal spatiotemporal structure in quantum light fields. This method will further advance the understanding of the dynamics in nonlinear quantum optics and expand the potential of photons for applications in quantum communication and quantum computing.

TL;DR: The paper develops two approximate numerical methods with offset corrections to calculate photon statistics of superradiant emission in large quantum emitter ensembles, overcoming exponential scaling problems of exact methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential scaling of Hilbert space dimension makes exact calculation of the two-time quantum correlation function g^(2)(t,τ) intractable for large ensembles of quantum emitters, despite superradiance's importance in quantum optics.

Method: The authors analyze and benchmark two approximate numerical sampling methods for emitter arrays in electromagnetic environments that provide upper and lower bounds for g^(2)(t,0), and introduce offset corrections to improve accuracy.

Result: The methods, especially with offset corrections, provide accurate descriptions of superradiance across a broad range of regimes, with optimal choice depending on emitter count.

Conclusion: This work provides new theoretical tools for studying superradiance in large quantum emitter ensembles, enabling analysis previously computationally intractable.

Abstract: Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon in which coherence between emitters results in enhanced and directional radiative emission. Many quantum optical phenomena can be characterized by the two-time quantum correlation function $g^{(2)}(t,τ)$, which describes the photon statistics of emitted radiation. However, the critical task of determining $g^{(2)}(t,τ)$ becomes intractable for large emitter ensembles due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of emitters. Here, we analyse and benchmark two approximate numerical sampling methods applicable to emitter arrays embedded within electromagnetic environments, which generally provide upper and lower bounds for $g^{(2)}(t,0)$. We also introduce corrections to these methods (termed offset corrections) that significantly improve the quality of the predictions. The optimal choice of method depends on the total number of emitters, such that taken together, the two approaches provide accurate descriptions across a broad range of important regimes. This work therefore provides new theoretical tools for studying the well-known yet complex phenomenon of superradiance in large ensembles of quantum emitters.

Abstract: We study the localization and scattering of a single photon in a waveguide coupled to qubit arrays with quasiperiodic spacings. As the quasiperiodic strength increases, localized subradiant states with extremely long lifetime appear around the resonant frequency and form a continuum band. In stark contrast to the fully disordered waveguide QED where all states are localized, we analytically find that the fraction of localized states is up to $(3-\sqrt{5})/2$ when the modulation frequency is $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$. The localized and delocalized states can be related to excitation in flat and curved inverse energy bands under the approximation of large-period modulation. When the quasiperiodic strength is weak, an extended subradiant state can support the transmission of a photon. However, as the quasiperiodic strength increases, localized subradiant states can completely block the transmission of a single photon in resonance with the subradiant states, and enhance the overall reflection. At a fixed quasiperiodic strength, we also find mobility edge in transmission spectrum, below and above which the transmission is either turned on and off as system size increases. Our work give new insights into the localization in non-Hermitian systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续入侵检测需在严格操作约束（有限算力/量子比特预算、隐私规则禁止原始遥测数据长期存储）下，既要吸收新攻击阶段又要保持旧检测能力

Method: 1) Q-FISH：通过敏感度加权参数约束和保真度功能锚定项，用紧凑锚定共置强制保留历史流量决策能力；2) 隐私保护量子生成重放：通过冻结的任务条件生成器快照合成边界重放样本，在不存储敏感流的情况下恢复可塑性

Result: 在UNSW-NB15和CICIDS2017的三阶段攻击流测试中：QCL-IDS达到最佳保留-适应权衡，平均Attack-F1=0.941(UNSW)/0.944(CIC)，遗忘率仅0.005/0.004；而顺序微调基线仅为0.800/0.138和0.803/0.128

Conclusion: 量子中心化持续学习框架QCL-IDS能有效平衡新攻击适应与旧知识保留，在NISQ时代管道中实现高检测性能与极低遗忘的实用化部署

Abstract: Continual intrusion detection must absorb newly emerging attack stages while retaining legacy detection capability under strict operational constraints, including bounded compute and qubit budgets and privacy rules that preclude long-term storage of raw telemetry. We propose QCL-IDS, a quantum-centric continual-learning framework that co-designs stability and privacy-governed rehearsal for NISQ-era pipelines. Its core component, Q-FISH (Quantum Fisher Anchors), enforces retention using a compact anchor coreset through (i) sensitivity-weighted parameter constraints and (ii) a fidelity-based functional anchoring term that directly limits decision drift on representative historical traffic. To regain plasticity without retaining sensitive flows, QCL-IDS further introduces privacy-preserved quantum generative replay (QGR) via frozen, task-conditioned generator snapshots that synthesize bounded rehearsal samples. Across a three-stage attack stream on UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017, QCL-IDS consistently attains the best retention-adaptation trade-off: the gradient-anchor configuration achieves mean Attack-F1 = 0.941 with forgetting = 0.005 on UNSW-NB15 and mean Attack-F1 = 0.944 with forgetting = 0.004 on CICIDS2017, versus 0.800/0.138 and 0.803/0.128 for sequential fine-tuning, respectively.

TL;DR: 本研究揭示了一维离散时间量子行走中斐波那契调制下的全局拓扑相图，发现拓扑边缘态不仅出现在零能，也出现在准能量边界π处，且准周期无序下拓扑保护依然稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索准周期无序系统中非平衡拓扑相的鲁棒性，为实验观测奇异拓扑相提供新路径。传统拓扑相在无序下易被破坏，而准周期势场（如斐波那契调制）介于周期与随机之间，研究其如何影响Floquet拓扑保护机制具有重要理论和实验价值。

Method: 利用平均手征位移（MCD）作为动力学探针，系统研究斐波那契调制硬币参数的一维离散时间量子行走模型，计算拓扑不变量（绕数ν）和边缘态局域特性。

Result: 1. 识别出稳定的拓扑相，绕数严格量子化为ν=-1；2. 发现指数局域的边缘态存在于零能(E=0)和准能量区边界(E=π)；3. 尽管体谱呈分形结构，边缘态仍保持相同局域鲁棒性；4. 证明Floquet拓扑保护在准周期无序下保持完整。

Conclusion: 准周期无序不会破坏拓扑保护，反而在更丰富的能谱结构中产生多重拓扑边缘态，为在光子实验平台上实现和观测非平衡拓扑相提供了具体可行的方案，拓展了非厄米拓扑物理的研究维度。

Abstract: We uncover the global topological phase diagram of one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks driven by Fibonacci-modulated coin parameters. Utilizing the mean chiral displacement (MCD) as dynamical probe, we identify robust topological phases defined by a strictly quantized winding number $ν=-1$ and exponentially localized edge states. Crucially, we discover that these topological edge modes emerges not only at zero energy but also at the quasienergy zone boundary $E=π$, exhibiting identical localization robustness despite the fractal nature of the bulk spectrum. These results demonstrate that Floquet topological protection remains intact amidst quasiperiodic disorder, offering a concrete route to observing exotic non-equilibrium phases in photonic experiments.

Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of a free-electron beam interacting with quantized bound systems in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. This expands the quantum optics toolbox to incorporate free-electron beams for applications in highly tunable quantum control, imaging, and spectroscopy at the nanoscale. The framework recovers previously studied results and shows that electromagnetic environments can amplify the intrinsically weak coupling between a free-electron and a bound electron to reach previously inaccessible interaction regimes. We leverage this enhanced coupling for experimentally feasible protocols in coherent qubit control and towards the nondestructive readout and projective control of the electron beam's quantum-number statistics. Our framework is broadly applicable to microwave-frequency qubits, optical nanophotonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and emerging platforms at the interface of electron microscopy and quantum information.

Abstract: This study investigates the role of EPR steering in characterizing the energy dynamics of quantum batteries (QBs) within \textcolor{black}{a charging system that features shared reservoirs. After optimizing parameter configurations to achieve high-energy systems, we observe across a variety of charging scenarios with low-dissipation regimes that steering serves as a vital resource: it is initially stored until the system reaches energy equilibrium, and then subsequently utilized to sustain the enhancement of energy storage. Furthermore, steering acts as a witness to battery population balance and a consumable that enhances extractable work. Additionally, we discuss the contribution of the steering potential to energy upon high-dissipation charging in details. These findings establish a novel indicator for monitoring QB energy variations, which will be beneficial to achieve the high-performance quantum batteries.

Conclusion: OAI协议突破了传统线性淬火的时间限制，在保持临界动力学标度律的同时实现效率提升；建立的ζ参数体系为量子绝热演化的精确控制提供了新框架，尤其适用于含噪声实际量子系统的优化设计。

Abstract: We propose an optimized adiabatic-impulse (OAI) protocol that achieves much shorter evolution time while preserving the Kibble-Zurek scaling. Near the critical regime, the control field is linearly ramped across the quantum critical point at a rate characterized by a quench time $τ_Q$. Away from the critical regime, the evolution is designed to follow the threshold of adiabatic breakdown, which we characterize by an adiabatic coefficient $ζ\proptoτ_Q^α$. As a consequence, the total evolution time exhibits a sublinear power-law dependence on $τ_Q$, and the conventional linear quench protocol is recovered in the limit $α\rightarrow\infty$. We apply the OAI protocol to the transverse Ising chain and numerically determine the minimum value of $ζ$. We further investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics in the presence of a noisy field that can induce anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior, leading to more defects for slower ramps. Within the OAI protocol, the optimal quench time that minimizes defects obeys an altered universal power-law scaling with the noise strength. Finally, we generalize the OAI protocol to incorporate nonlinear Kibble-Zurek scaling.

Motivation: 随着容错量子计算的发展，对物理设备和逻辑算法进行基准测试和验证变得至关重要。现有协议通常在运行实际算法前对设备进行基准测试，但缺乏在位（in-situ）表征能力。

Abstract: Benchmarking physical devices and verifying logical algorithms are important tasks for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing. Numerous protocols exist for benchmarking devices before running actual algorithms. In this work, we show that both physical and logical errors of fault-tolerant circuits can even be characterized in-situ using syndrome data. To achieve this, we map general fault-tolerant Clifford circuits to subsystem codes using the spacetime code formalism and develop a scheme for estimating Pauli noise in Clifford circuits using syndrome data. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the learnability of physical and logical noise from given syndrome data, and show that we can accurately predict logical fidelities from the same data. Importantly, our approach requires only a polynomial sample size, even when the logical error rate is exponentially suppressed by the code distance, and thus gives an exponential advantage against methods that use only logical data such as direct fidelity estimation. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our methods in various scenarios using synthetic data as well as the experimental data from a recent demonstration of fault-tolerant circuits by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. Our methods provide an efficient, in-situ way of characterizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer to help gate calibration, improve decoding accuracy, and verify logical circuits.

Abstract: Color centers that enable nuclear-spin control without RF fields offer a powerful route towards simplified and scalable quantum devices. Such capabilities are especially valuable for quantum sensing and computing platforms that already find applications in biology, materials science, and geophysics. A key challenge is the coherent manipulation of nearby nuclear spins, which serve as quantum memories and auxiliary qubits but conventionally require additional high-power RF fields which increase the experimental complexity and overall power consumption. Finding systems where both electron and nuclear spins can be controlled using a single MW source is therefore highly desirable. Here, using a modified divacancy center in silicon carbide, we show that coherent control of a coupled nuclear spin is possible without any RF fields. Instead, MW pulses driving the electron spin also manipulate the nuclear spin through hyperfineenhanced effects, activated by a precisely tilted external magnetic field. We demonstrate high-fidelity nuclear-spin control, achieving 89% two-qubit tomography fidelity and nearly T1-limited nuclear coherence times. This approach offers a simplified and scalable route for future quantum applications.

Abstract: Fluxonium superconducting circuits were originally proposed to realize highly coherent qubits. In this work, we explore how these circuits can be used to implement and harness qutrits, by tuning their energy levels and matrix elements via an external flux bias. In particular, we investigate the distinctive features of arrays of fluxonium qutrits, and their potential for the quantum simulation of exotic quantum matter. We identify four different operational regimes, classified according to the plasmon-like versus fluxon-like nature of the qutrit excitations. Highly tunable on-site interactions are complemented by correlated single-particle hopping, pair hopping and non-local interactions, which naturally emerge and have different weights in the four regimes. Dispersive corrections and decoherence are also analyzed. We investigate the rich ground-state phase diagram of qutrit arrays and propose practical dynamical experiments to probe the different regimes. Altogether, fluxonium qutrit arrays emerge as a versatile and experimentally accessible platform to explore strongly correlated bosonic matter beyond the Bose-Hubbard paradigm, and with a potential toward simulating lattice gauge theories and non-Abelian topological states.

Abstract: High-coherence, fault-tolerant and scalable quantum computing architectures with unprecedented long coherence times, faster gates, low losses and low bit-flip errors may be one of the only ways forward to achieve the true quantum advantage. In this context, high-frequency high-coherence (HCQC) qubits with new high-performance topologies could be a significant step towards efficient and high-fidelity quantum computing by facilitating compact size, higher scalability and higher than conventional operating temperatures. Although transmon type qubits are designed and manufactured routinely in the range of a few Giga-Hertz, normally from 4 to 6 GHz (and, at times, up to around 10GHz), achieving higher-frequency operation has challenges and entails special design and manufacturing considerations. This report presents the proposal and preliminary design of an 8-qubit transmon (with possible upgrade to up to 72 qubits on a chip) architecture working beyond an operation frequency of 10GHz, as well as presents a new connection topology. The current design spans a range of around 11 to 13.5 GHz (with a possible full range of 9-12GHz at the moment), with a central optimal operating frequency of 12.0 GHz, with the aim to possibly achieve a stable, compact and low-charge-noise operation, as lowest as possible as per the existing fabrication techniques. The aim is to achieve average relaxation times of up to 1.9ms with average quality factors of up to 2.75 x 10^7 after trials, while exploiting the new advances in superconducting junction manufacturing using tantalum and niobium/aluminum/aluminum oxide tri-layer structures on high-resistivity silicon substrates (carried out elsewhere by other groups and referred in this report).

TL;DR: 该论文证明在混合van Hove理论框架下，量子态可通过经典介质产生纠缠，这挑战了现有"不可能定理"的普适性，并表明纠缠研究无法排除包含经典引力的自洽量子理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子态能否通过经典介质产生纠缠存在争议，这一问题与"纠缠研究能否证明引力量子性"密切相关。由于答案取决于具体混合量子-经典理论，现有"不可能定理"可能并不普适，需要检验不同理论框架下的纠缠生成能力。

Method: 在混合van Hove理论框架下，以经典谐振子为介质耦合两个量子自旋，推导该混合系统的自旋密度矩阵，并与全量子系统等价情形进行对比分析。

Result: 在混合van Hove理论和全量子系统中，两个自旋之间均能产生纠缠。通过计算自旋系统的纯度与并发度(concurrence)作为纠缠判据，证实了两自旋间存在纠缠。

Conclusion: 混合van Hove理论允许经典介质传递纠缠，表明现有"不可能定理"不适用于所有混合理论。因此，仅凭量子纠缠实验无法排除经典引力存在的可能性，挑战了"纠缠可证明引力量子性"的传统观点。

Abstract: It is a matter of ongoing discussion whether quantum states can become entangled while only interacting via a classical mediator. This lively debate is deeply interwoven with the question of whether entanglement studies can prove the quantum nature of gravity. However, the answer to this fundamental question depends crucially on which hybrid quantum-classical theory is used. In this letter, we demonstrate that entanglement by a classical mediator is possible within the framework of hybrid van Hove theory, showing that existing no-go theorems on that matter do not universally apply to hybrid theories in general. After briefly recapitulating the key features of the hybrid van Hove theory, we show this using the example of two quantum spins coupled by a classical harmonic oscillator. By deriving the spin density matrix for this scenario and comparing it to its equivalent for a pure quantum system, we show that entanglement between the two spins is generated in both cases. Conclusively, this is illustrated by presenting the purity and concurrence of the spin-spin system as a decisive measure for entanglement. Our results further imply that quantum entanglement studies cannot rule out consistent quantum theories featuring classical gravity.

Conclusion: 该工作建立了紧凑且硬件高效的偏置擦除量子比特平台，有望级联到外部稳定子码中，为实现容错量子计算提供前景。

Abstract: Erasure qubits are beneficial for quantum error correction due to their relaxed threshold requirements. While dual-rail erasure qubits have been demonstrated with a strong error hierarchy in circuit quantum electrodynamics, biased-erasure qubits -- where erasures originate predominantly from one logical basis state -- offer further advantages. Here, we realize a hardware-efficient biased-erasure qubit encoded in the vacuum and two-photon Fock states of a single microwave cavity. The qubit exhibits an erasure bias ratio of over 265. By using a transmon ancilla for logical measurements and mid-circuit erasure detections, we achieve logical state assignment errors below 1% and convert over 99.3% leakage errors into detected erasures. After postselection against erasures, we achieve effective logical relaxation and dephasing rates of $(6.2~\mathrm{ms})^{-1}$ and $(3.1~\mathrm{ms})^{-1}$, respectively, which exceed the erasure error rate by factors of 31 and 15, establishing a strong error hierarchy within the logical subspace. These postselected error rates indicate a coherence gain of about 6.0 beyond the break-even point set by the best physical qubit encoded in the two lowest Fock states in the cavity. Moreover, randomized benchmarking with interleaved erasure detections reveals a residual logical gate error of 0.29%. This work establishes a compact and hardware-efficient platform for biased-erasure qubits, promising concatenations into outer-level stabilizer codes toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: Many quantum software development kits provide a suite of circuit optimisation passes. These passes have been highly optimised and tested in isolation. However, the order in which they are applied is left to the user, or else defined in general-purpose default pass sequences. While general-purpose sequences miss opportunities for optimisation which are particular to individual circuits, designing pass sequences bespoke to particular circuits requires exceptional knowledge about quantum circuit design and optimisation. Here we propose and demonstrate training a reinforcement learning agent to compose optimisation-pass sequences. In particular the agent's action space consists of passes for two-qubit gate count reduction used in default PyTKET pass sequences. For the circuits in our diverse test set, the (mean, median) fraction of two-qubit gates removed by the agent is $(57.7\%, \ 56.7 \%)$, compared to $(41.8 \%, \ 50.0 \%)$ for the next best default pass sequence.

Motivation: 量子纠错解码器是容错量子计算的核心，但最优解码属于NP难问题。现有近似解码器虽运行速度快，但依赖缺乏理论保证的启发式策略，亟需一种在效率与精度间可平衡且具备严格最优性保证的解码方案。

Conclusion: 该研究成功架起了快速启发式解码与严格最优解码之间的桥梁，提供了一种具有可调性能权衡且保留最优性保证的量子解码新方法。

Abstract: Decoders are a critical component of fault-tolerant quantum computing. They must identify errors based on syndrome measurements to correct quantum states. While finding the optimal correction is NP-hard and thus extremely difficult, approximate decoders with faster runtime often rely on uncontrolled heuristics. In this work, we propose a family of hierarchical quantum decoders with a tunable trade-off between speed and accuracy while retaining guarantees of optimality. We use the Lasserre Sum-of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy from optimization theory to relax the decoding problem. This approach creates a sequence of Semidefinite Programs (SDPs). Lower levels of the hierarchy are faster but approximate, while higher levels are slower but more accurate. We demonstrate that even low levels of this hierarchy significantly outperform standard Linear Programming relaxations. Our results on rotated surface codes and honeycomb color codes show that the SOS decoder approaches the performance of exact decoding. We find that Levels 2 and 3 of our hierarchy perform nearly as well as the exact solver. We analyze the convergence using rank-loop criteria and compare the method against other relaxation schemes.

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum machine learning models require deep parameterized circuits to capture complex frequency components, which limits their scalability and practical implementation on near-term quantum hardware.

Method: Proposes Quantum Random Features (QRF) and Quantum Dynamical Random Features (QDRF), reservoir-based models inspired by classical random Fourier features that use Z-rotation encoding with random permutations or Hamiltonian dynamics to create N_f-dimensional feature maps at O(log(N_f)) preprocessing cost.

Result: Spectral analysis confirms QRF/QDRF reproduce classical RFF behavior, while simulations on Fashion-MNIST achieve up to 89.3% accuracy, matching or surpassing classical baselines with scalable qubit requirements.

Conclusion: This work provides a compact, hardware-compatible pathway to scalable quantum learning by connecting spectral theory with experimentally feasible quantum dynamics.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models often require deep, parameterized circuits to capture complex frequency components, limiting their scalability and near-term implementation. We introduce \textit{Quantum Random Features} (QRF) and \textit{Quantum Dynamical Random Features} (QDRF), lightweight quantum reservoir models inspired by classical random Fourier features (RFF) that generate high-dimensional spectral representations without variational optimization. Using $Z$-rotation encoding combined with random permutations or Hamiltonian dynamics, these models achieve $N_f$-dimensional feature maps at preprocessing cost $O(\log(N_f))$. Spectral analysis shows that QRF and QDRF reproduce the behavior of RFF, while simulations on Fashion-MNIST reach up to 89.3\% accuracy-matching or surpassing classical baselines with scalable qubit requirements. By linking spectral theory with experimentally feasible quantum dynamics, this work provides a compact and hardware-compatible route to scalable quantum learning.

### [135] [A geometric criterion for optimal measurements in multiparameter quantum metrology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21801)
*Jing Yang,Satoya Imai,Luca Pezzè*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper establishes that multiparameter quantum Cramér-Rao bound saturation requires simultaneous "hollowization" of traceless operators, enabling geometric construction of optimal measurements and refuting prior partial commutativity conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving the central open problem in quantum metrology: determining when multiparameter QCRB is saturable with experimentally feasible single-copy measurements.

Method: Formulating equivalence between QCRB saturation and simultaneous hollowization of estimation model's traceless operators (vanishing diagonal elements in complete bases).

Result: Optimal rank-one measurements are confined to subspaces orthogonal to state-determined Hermitian spans; provides direct criterion for constructing optimal POVMs.

Conclusion: Partial commutativity condition (Phys. Rev. A 100, 032104) is not always sufficient for QCRB saturation; informationally-complete POVMs are counter-intuitively useless for achieving the bound.

Abstract: Determining when the multiparameter quantum Cramér--Rao bound (QCRB) is saturable with experimentally relevant single-copy measurements is a central open problem in quantum metrology. Here we establish an equivalence between QCRB saturation and the simultaneous hollowization of a set of traceless operators associated with the estimation model, i.e., the existence of complete (generally nonorthogonal) bases in which all corresponding diagonal matrix elements vanish. This formulation yields a geometric characterization: optimal rank-one measurement vectors are confined to a subspace orthogonal to a state-determined Hermitian span. This provides a direct criterion to construct optimal Positive Operator-Valued Measures(POVMs). We then identify conditions under which the partial commutativity condition proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 100, 032104(2019)] becomes necessary and sufficient for the saturation of the QCRB, demonstrate that this condition is not always sufficient, and prove the counter-intuitive uselessness of informationally-complete POVMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决量子力学中EPR定域性悖论的问题，证明其在哥本哈根解释中不存在，从而澄清量子力学的基础问题。

Method: 引入薛定谔1935年论文中隐含的原理，以两个自旋1/2的纠缠态为例，假设测量导致波包坍缩，并考虑Araki和Yanase的 objections。

Result: 证明EPR定域性悖论在哥本哈根解释中不存在，该悖论在简单纠缠态中也是 well-posed 的，且独立于Araki和Yanase的 objections。

Conclusion: EPR定域性悖论在哥本哈根解释中不成立，这支持了量子力学的自洽性。

Abstract: We introduce a principle, implicitly contained in Schroedinger's paper (Schr35), which allows a proof of the non-existence of the EPR-locality paradox in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The paradox is shown to be well-posed already in the simplest example of an entangled state of two spins one-half, independently of the (well-taken) objections by Araki and Yanase that the measurement of spin is not a local measurement. We assume that any measurement results in the collapse of the wave-packet.

Conclusion: 研究证实辅助量子比特操作错误是当前量子纠错性能的主要限制因素，所提方法显著提升纠错增益，为基于玻色模式的容错量子计算提供了可行技术路径，推动量子计算向实用化迈进。

Abstract: Protecting quantum information through quantum error correction (QEC) is a cornerstone of future fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, current QEC-protected logical qubits have only achieved coherence times about twice those of their best physical constituents. Here, we show that the primary barrier to higher QEC gains is ancilla-induced operational errors rather than intrinsic cavity coherence. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce error-detectable universal control of bosonic modes, wherein ancilla relaxation events are detected and the corresponding trajectories discarded, thereby suppressing operational errors on logical qubits. For binomial codes, we demonstrate universal gates with fidelities exceeding $99.6\%$ and QEC gains of $8.33\times$ beyond break-even. Our results establish that gains beyond $10\times$ are achievable with state-of-the-art devices, establishing a path toward fault-tolerant bosonic quantum computing.

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floquet码作为新型动态测量基量子纠错码，其短深度逻辑操作是否受Bravyi-König定理约束尚不明确，需验证该定理在动态生成码空间场景下的普适性

Method: 基于局部共轭稳定子群定义Floquet码，引入与测量组合构成有效逻辑操作的广义酉算子，推导其标准形式，并证明BK定理对两者均成立

Result: 证明了BK定理对局部共轭稳定子Floquet码成立，且对不保持每步码空间的广义酉算子同样成立，这些操作均属于Clifford层级第D级

Conclusion: 动态Floquet码继承了静态拓扑稳定子码的计算限制，短深度操作无法实现超越Clifford层级的高阶逻辑门，为Floquet码的容错计算能力划定了理论边界

Abstract: The Bravyi-König (BK) theorem is an important no-go theorem for the dynamics of topological stabiliser quantum error correcting codes. It states that any logical operation on a $D$-dimensional topological stabiliser code that can be implemented by a short-depth circuit acts on the codespace as an element of the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. In recent years, a new type of quantum error correcting codes based on Pauli stabilisers, dubbed Floquet codes, has been introduced. In Floquet codes, syndrome measurements are arranged such that they dynamically generate a codespace at each time step. Here, we show that the BK theorem holds for a definition of Floquet codes based on locally conjugate stabiliser groups. Moreover, we introduce and define a class of generalised unitaries in Floquet codes that need not preserve the codespace at each time step, but that combined with the measurements constitute a valid logical operation. We derive a canonical form of these generalised unitaries and show that the BK theorem holds for them too.

Result: 核心发现包括：（1）在低光子数极限下，容量区域退化为矩形，且随着多用户干扰消失而渐近逼近点对点容量；（2）纠缠辅助使双用户聚合隐蔽吞吐量达到 O(√n log n) 量级，超越平方根律；（3）联合隐蔽性约束导致用户间吞吐量呈线性此消彼长关系。

Conclusion: 纠缠辅助为多用户隐蔽通信带来显著性能提升，不仅突破经典极限，还揭示了多用户场景下隐蔽性约束带来的基本速率权衡机制。

Abstract: We consider the problem of covert communication over the entanglement-assisted (EA) bosonic multiple access channel (MAC). We derive a closed-form achievable rate region for the general EA bosonic MAC using high-order phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the low-photon regime the capacity region collapses into a rectangle, asymptotically matching the point-to-point capacity as multi-user interference vanishes. We also characterize an achievable covert throughput region, showing that entanglement assistance enables an aggregate throughput scaling of \(O(\sqrt{n} \log n)\) covert bits with the block length $n$ for both senders, surpassing the square-root law as in the point-to-point case. Our analysis reveals that the joint covertness constraint imposes a linear trade-off between the senders throughput.

Conclusion: 该方法突破了半导体量子计算的温度和速度限制，可推广至其他具有太赫兹激发态的固态量子系统，具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Each cycle of a quantum computation requires a quantum state initialisation. For semiconductor-based quantum platforms, initialisation is typically performed via slow microwave processes and usually requires cooling to temperatures where only the lowest quantum level is occupied. In silicon, boron atoms are the most common impurities. They bind holes in orbitals including an effective spin-3/2 ground state as well as excited states analogous to the Rydberg series for hydrogen. Here we show that initialisation temperature demands may be relaxed and speeds increased over a thousand-fold by importing, from atomic physics, the procedure of optical pumping via excited orbital states to preferentially occupy a target ground state spin. Spin relaxation within the orbital ground state of unstrained silicon is too fast to measure for conventional pulsed microwave technology, except at temperatures below 2 K, implying a need not only for fast state preparation but also fast state readout. Circularly polarised ~10 THz photon pulses from a free electron laser meet both needs at temperatures above 3 K: a 9 ps pulse enhances the population of one spin eigenstate for the "1s"-like ground state orbital, and the second interrogates this imbalance in spin population. Using parameters given by our data, we calculate that it should be possible to initialise 99% of spins for boron in strained silicon within 250 ps at 3 K. The speedup of both state preparation and measurement gained for THz rather than microwave photons should be explored for the many other solid state quantum systems hosting THz excitations potentially useful as intermediate states.

*Guillaume Théret,Dominique Sugny,Camille L. Latune*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper compares multiple entropy production rate definitions in quantum systems, finding they converge at weak coupling but diverge at strong coupling except for two specific definitions that remain identical; it also links memory effects (P-divisibility) to entropy sign at weak coupling and extends entropy production to dynamical maps for strong-coupling equivalence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve discrepancies among various entropy production rate definitions in quantum thermodynamics and clarify their relationship with memory effects (non-Markovianity) across different coupling regimes.

Method: Analytical comparison of entropy production definitions using a qubit-bosonic mode model (finite bath), validated with phase-covariant master equations and numerical/analytical verification of P-divisibility and dynamical map extensions.

Result: (1) All definitions coincide at weak coupling; (2) Significant discrepancies emerge at strong coupling except for two definitions (local vs. non-local) that remain identical; (3) P-divisibility correlates with entropy sign at weak coupling but degrades at strong coupling; (4) Extended entropy production via dynamical maps achieves perfect equivalence with P-divisibility in phase-covariant systems.

Conclusion: Entropy production definitions unify under weak coupling and dynamical map extensions, but strong coupling requires context-specific definitions; the dynamical map framework resolves strong-coupling discrepancies and fully characterizes non-Markovian memory effects via entropy sign.

Abstract: We compare several definitions of entropy production rate introduced in the literature from a large variety of situations and motivations, and then analyze their relations with memory effects. Considering a relevant experimental example of a qubit interacting with a single bosonic mode playing the role of a finite bath, we show that all definitions of entropy production coincide at weak coupling. In the strong coupling regime, significant discrepancies emerge between the different entropy production rates, although some similarities in the overall behaviour remain. However, surprisingly, two of these definitions -- one based on local quantities of the system and the other on non-local quantities -- coincide exactly, even in the case of strong coupling. Finally, a high degree of correspondence is observed when memory effects characterized by P-divisibility are compared with the sign of all entropy production rates in the case of weak coupling. Such correspondence degrades at strong coupling, leading us to extend the concept of entropy production to the dynamical map. We show a perfect equivalence between the sign of this enlarged concept of entropy production and P-divisibility, both numerically and analytically, in the case of phase-covariant master equations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MMD-$k$, a hierarchy of quantum distance metrics that generalize maximum mean discrepancy, revealing a trade-off between discriminative power and statistical efficiency with applications in quantum machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distances between ensembles of quantum states remain poorly understood due to fundamental quantum measurement constraints, despite being central to machine learning.

Method: Introducing a hierarchy of integral probability metrics termed MMD-$k$ that generalizes the maximum mean discrepancy to quantum ensembles, using experimentally feasible SWAP-test-based estimators.

Result: For pure-state ensembles of size N: MMD-$k$ requires Θ(N^{2-2/k}) samples for constant k, and Θ(N^3) samples for full discriminative power at k=N; quantum Wasserstein distance achieves full discriminative power with Θ(N^2 log N) samples.

Conclusion: These results provide principled guidance for designing loss functions in quantum machine learning, demonstrated through training quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models.

Abstract: Distance metrics are central to machine learning, yet distances between ensembles of quantum states remain poorly understood due to fundamental quantum measurement constraints. We introduce a hierarchy of integral probability metrics, termed MMD-$k$, which generalizes the maximum mean discrepancy to quantum ensembles and exhibit a strict trade-off between discriminative power and statistical efficiency as the moment order $k$ increases. For pure-state ensembles of size $N$, estimating MMD-$k$ using experimentally feasible SWAP-test-based estimators requires $Θ(N^{2-2/k})$ samples for constant $k$, and $Θ(N^3)$ samples to achieve full discriminative power at $k = N$. In contrast, the quantum Wasserstein distance attains full discriminative power with $Θ(N^2 \log N)$ samples. These results provide principled guidance for the design of loss functions in quantum machine learning, which we illustrate in the training quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models.

Conclusion: 即使在训练期间才使用的最小化量子特征提取也能产生显著的量子优势，且标准的经典算法（如SVM+）可以有效利用量子增强的数据。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is often listed as a promising candidate for useful applications of quantum computers, in part due to numerous proofs of possible quantum advantages. A central question is how small a role quantum computers can play while still enabling provable learning advantages over classical methods. We study an especially restricted setting in which a quantum computer is used only as a feature extractor: it acts independently on individual data points, without access to labels or global dataset information, is available only to augment the training set, and is not available at deployment. Training and deployment are therefore carried out by fully classical learners on a dataset augmented with quantum-generated features. We formalize this model by adapting the classical framework of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) to the quantum case, which we call Learning Under Quantum Privileged Information (LUQPI). Within this framework, we show that even such minimally involved quantum feature extraction, available only during training, can yield exponential quantum-classical separations for suitable concept classes and data distributions under reasonable computational assumptions. We further situate LUQPI within a taxonomy of related quantum and classical learning settings and show how standard classical machinery, most notably the SVM+ algorithm, can exploit quantum-augmented data. Finally, we present numerical experiments in a physically motivated many-body setting, where privileged quantum features are expectation values of observables on ground states, and observe consistent performance gains for LUQPI-style models over strong classical baselines.

Abstract: A growing variety of optically accessible spin qubits have emerged in recent years as key components for quantum sensors, qubits, and quantum memories. However, the scalability of conventional spin-based quantum architectures remains limited by direct microwave delivery, which introduces thermal noise, electromagnetic cross-talk, and design constraints for cryogenic, high-field, and distributed systems. In this work, we present a unified framework for RF-over-fiber (RFoF) control of optically accessible spins through RFoF optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The RFoF platform relies on an electro-optically modulated telecom-band laser that transmits microwave signals over fiber and a high-speed photodiode that recovers the RF waveform to drive NV center spin transitions. We obtain an RFoF efficiency of 1.81\% at 2.90~GHz, corresponding to $P_{\mathrm{RF,out}}=-0.7$~dBm. The RFoF architecture provides a path toward low-noise, thermally isolated, and cryo-compatible ODMR systems bridging conventional spin-based quantum sensing protocols with emerging distributed quantum technologies.

Abstract: Open quantum systems interact with their environment, leading to nonunitary dynamics. We investigate the thermodynamics of linear Open Quantum Walks (OQWs), a class of quantum walks whose dynamics is entirely driven by the environment. We define an equilibrium temperature, identify a population inversion near a finite critical value of a control parameter, analyze the thermalization process, and develop the statistical mechanics needed to describe the thermodynamical properties of linear OQWs. We also study nonequilibrium thermodynamics by analyzing the time evolution of entropy, energy, and temperature, while providing analytical tools to understand the system's evolution as it converges to the thermalized state. We examine the validity of the second and third laws of thermodynamics in this setting. Finally, we employ these developments to shed light on dissipative quantum computation within the OQW framework.

Abstract: Interacting spin systems in solids underpin a wide range of quantum technologies, from quantum sensors and single-photon sources to spin-defect-based quantum registers and processors. We develop a quantum-computer-aided framework for simulating such devices using a general electron spin resonance Hamiltonian incorporating zero-field splitting, the Zeeman effect, hyperfine interactions, dipole-dipole spin-spin terms, and electron-phonon decoherence. Within this model, we combine Gray-encoded qudit-to-qubit mappings, qubit-wise commuting aggregation, and a multi-reference selected quantum Krylov fast-forwarding (sQKFF) hybrid algorithm to access long-time dynamics while remaining compatible with NISQ and early fault-tolerant hardware constraints. Numerical simulations demonstrate the computation of autocorrelation functions up to $\sim100$ ns, together with microwave absorption spectra and the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence, achieving 18-30$\%$ reductions in gate counts and circuit depth for Trotterized time-evolution circuits compared to unoptimized implementations. Using the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond as a testbed, we benchmark the framework against classical simulations and identify the reference-state selection in sQKFF as the primary factor governing accuracy at fixed hardware cost. This methodology provides a flexible blueprint for using quantum computers to design, compare, and optimize solid-state spin-qubit technologies under experimentally realistic conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ising machines suffer from solution quality heavily dependent on heuristic parameter tuning due to lack of systematic understanding of dynamics and phase behaviors.

Method: Analyzing phase diagrams of spin distributions in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model to identify optimal operational phases for Ising machines.

Result: Found that ground states are achieved when spin distribution becomes binary, and optimal solutions occur at the coexistence region of binary and gapless phases; digitization operation expands this critical phase region.

Conclusion: Proposed digCIM algorithm demonstrates that Ising machines can achieve superior performance by leveraging the expanded phase coexistence region through strategic digitization operations.

Abstract: Ising machines, which are dynamical systems designed to operate in a parallel and iterative manner, have emerged as a new paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Despite computational advantages, the quality of solutions depends heavily on the form of dynamics and tuning of parameters, which are in general set heuristically due to the lack of systematic insights. Here, we focus on optimal Ising machine design by analyzing phase diagrams of spin distributions in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. We find that that the ground state can be achieved in the phase where the spin distribution becomes binary, and optimal solutions are produced where the binary phase and gapless phase coexist. Our analysis shows that such coexistence phase region can be expanded by carefully placing a digitization operation, giving rise to a family of superior Ising machines, as illustrated by the proposed algorithm digCIM.

Result: 1) 获得纠缠膜和算符扩散的精确结果；2) 发现自由行为与相互作用行为间存在大交叉长度尺度；3) 揭示纠缠膜作为双行波束缚态的特性；4) 观察到纠缠膜速度接近蝴蝶速度时的解绑现象。

Conclusion: 该理论框架与随机幺正电路方法有本质区别，为相互作用量子系统中的信息 scrambling 提供了新的连续描述范式，特别揭示了纠缠膜的独特动力学行为。

Abstract: We develop an effective continuum description for information scrambling in a chain of randomly interacting Majorana fermions. The approach is based on the semiclassical treatment of the path integral for an effective spin chain that describes "two-replica" observables such as the entanglement purity and the OTOC. This formalism gives exact results for the entanglement membrane and for operator spreading in the limit of weak interactions. In this limit there is a large crossover lengthscale between free and interacting behavior, and this large lengthscale allows for a continuum limit and a controlled saddle-point calculation. The formalism is also somewhat different from that known from random unitary circuits. The entanglement membrane emerges as a kind of bound state of two travelling waves, and shows an interesting unbinding phenomenon as the velocity of the entanglement membrane approaches the butterfly velocity.

TL;DR: 本研究通过开发动态pebble game算法，揭示了三角晶格刚性逾渗过程中被忽视的时间自相似性和级联合并事件，显著提升了临界点和临界指数的测量精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注固定占据概率下的静态性质，而刚性逾渗的动力学演化过程（如刚性簇如何随键序添加而涌现和演化）尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出一种动态pebble game算法，以与静态方法相当的效率模拟键序逐次添加过程，监测刚性簇的动态演化行为。

Result: 发现时间自相似性：包括团簇尺寸变化、合并团簇尺寸及同时合并团簇数均呈现标度行为；识别出大尺度级联事件（单键添加触发与系统尺寸相关的多团簇合并），测得临界点p_c=0.6602778(10)、逆相关长度指数1/ν=0.850(3)和分形维数d_f=1.850(2)。

Conclusion: 该动态方法不仅揭示了刚性逾渗的动力学标度律和级联机制，更将临界参数测量精度提升至新水平，为理解无序材料中力学稳定性的动态起源提供了新框架。

Abstract: Rigidity percolation provides an important basis for understanding the onset of mechanical stability in disordered materials. While most studies on the triangular lattice have focused on static properties at fixed bond~(site) occupation probabilities, the dynamics of the rigidity transition remain less explored. In this work, we formulate a dynamic pebble game algorithm that monitors how rigid clusters emerge and evolve as bonds are added sequentially to an empty lattice, with computational efficiency comparable to the standard static pebble game. We uncover a previously overlooked temporal self-similarity exhibited in multiple quantities, including the cluster size changes and merged cluster sizes during bond addition, as well as the number of simultaneously merging clusters. We identify large-scale cascade events in which a single bond addition triggers the merger of an extensive number of clusters that scales with system size with inverse correlation-length exponent. Using an event-based ensemble approach, we obtain high-precision estimates of the critical point $p_c = 0.660\,277\,8(10)$, the inverse correlation-length exponent $1/ν= 0.850(3)$, and the fractal dimension $d_f = 1.850(2)$, representing substantial improvements over existing values.

TL;DR: 本文通过费米子表述和复平面围道积分方法，研究了二维经典伊辛模型自对偶临界线上交叉帽重叠的有限尺寸修正，发现其随系统尺寸指数衰减，并给出了衰减常数的精确解析公式。

Motivation: 理解临界系统中有限尺寸效应对拓扑或边界相关物理量的影响，对于深入认识相变机制和普适性类具有重要意义。

Method: 采用费米子表述将晶格交叉帽重叠转化为Bogoliubov角，并通过将晶格动量解析延拓至复平面发展围道积分方法。

Result: 获得了交叉帽重叠的简洁表达式，证实有限尺寸修正呈指数衰减，并推导出由Bogoliubov角复奇点结构决定的衰减常数精确公式。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅简化了相关物理量的计算，还揭示了奇点结构对有限尺寸行为的决定性作用，为类似问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: We analyze the finite-size corrections to the crosscap overlap in the two-dimensional classical Ising model along its self-dual critical line. Using a fermionic formulation, we express the lattice crosscap overlap in terms of Bogoliubov angles and develop a contour-integral approach by analytically continuing the lattice momentum to the complex plane. This leads to a remarkably simple expression for the crosscap overlap, which demonstrates that the finite-size corrections decay exponentially with system size. We further derive an exact analytical formula for the corresponding decay constant and show that it is determined by the complex singularity structure of the Bogoliubov angle.

Conclusion: 该研究系统计算了模型的三临界性质，验证了φ⁴项作为复合算符处理的有效性，为三临界现象提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We investigate the $λ\ph^4+g\ph^6$ model using the renormalization group method and the $\ep$ expansion. This model is used in a situation where the coefficients $λ$, $g$ and the coefficient $τ$ of the term $τ\ph^2$ depend on two parameters $T$ and $P$, and there is a point ($T_c,P_c$) at which $τ$ and $λ$ are zero. This point is named the tricritical point. The description of a system depends on a trajectory that leads to the tricritical point on the plane ($T,P$). In the trajectories, when $λ$ goes to zero fast enough, the description is defined by the $\ph^6$ interaction and then the $\ph^4$ term can be considered as a composite operator. In this case, the logarithmic dimension is $d=3$, and the $\ep$ expansion is carried out in the dimension $d=3-2\ep$. The main exponents of the \textit{tricritical} model have been calculated in the third order of the $\ep$ expansion. Taking into account the $\ph^4$ interaction, we were able to calculate the value of the parameter that determines the required decrease rate in $λ$ to implement the tricritical behavior. The tricritical dimensions of the composite operators $\ph^k$ for $k=1, 2, 4, 6$ have been computed. The resulting values are compared to those known from a conformal field theory and non-perturbative renormalization group.

Motivation: 探索耦合可激发系统产生多样斑图的机制，特别是不同耦合方式对环状与螺旋斑图形成、演化及失稳的影响，为可激发介质（如神经/心脏组织）的动力学提供新理解

Method: 采用二维Chialvo映射模型，施加两种近邻耦合（环形耦合与螺旋耦合）；创新性引入速度梯度张量判别式的类比指标，分析其符号持续性以量化斑图结构稳定性

Result: 环状斑图随耦合增强而扩展，符号持续性呈幂律/拉伸指数慢衰减；螺旋斑图在强耦合下湍流化并耗散，未破坏时持续性饱和并出现周期性振荡（暗示早期复杂指数行为）

Conclusion: 符号持续性行为与系统底层动力学存在深刻关联：环状结构反映慢衰减记忆效应，螺旋振荡揭示内在周期性，为斑图稳定性分析提供新理论框架

Abstract: Coupled excitable systems can generate a variety of patterns. In this work, we investigate coupled Chialvo maps in two dimensions under two types of nearest-neighbor couplings. One coupling produces ringlike patterns, while the other produces spirals. The rings expand with increasing coupling, whereas spirals evolve into turbulence and dissipate at stronger coupling. To quantify these patterns, we introduce an analogue of the discriminant of the velocity gradient tensor and examine the persistence of its sign. For ring-type patterns, the persistence decays more slowly than exponentially, often following a power law or stretched exponential. When spiral structures remain intact, persistence saturates asymptotically and can exhibit superposed periodic oscillations, suggesting complex exponents at early times. These behaviors highlight deep connections with the underlying dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种在训练过程中工作的新型灵活量化方法，替代后处理量化。

Method: 在训练过程中引入权重间的短程吸引耦合，仅使用两个超参数即可快速诱导权重分布离散化，实现混合精度量化。

Result: 在适当超参数范围内，软量化方案在ResNet-20/CIFAR-10上优于直方图均衡化后训练量化。

Conclusion: 软量化为机器学习模型的灵活压缩提供了新流程，并为研究高维损失景观中压缩与泛化的权衡提供了新工具。

Abstract: We show that introducing short-range attractive couplings between the weights of a neural network during training provides a novel avenue for model quantization. These couplings rapidly induce the discretization of a model's weight distribution, and they do so in a mixed-precision manner despite only relying on two additional hyperparameters. We demonstrate that, within an appropriate range of hyperparameters, our "soft quantization'' scheme outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10. Soft quantization provides both a new pipeline for the flexible compression of machine learning models and a new tool for investigating the trade-off between compression and generalization in high-dimensional loss landscapes.

*Rongzheng Wang,Yihong Huang,Muquan Li,Jiakai Li,Di Liang,Bob Simons,Pei Ke,Shuang Liang,Ke Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes DASH, a dynamics-aware framework for LLM-driven heuristic design that co-optimizes solver search and runtime schedules using a convergence-aware metric, and incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval to reduce adaptation costs by over 90% while improving runtime efficiency by 3x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LHD frameworks suffer from endpoint-only evaluation that ignores convergence/runtime efficiency, and high adaptation costs when facing distribution shifts requiring re-adaptation for new instance groups.

Method: The DASH framework co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric. It also includes Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR) that archives specialized solvers during evolution to enable cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions.

Result: Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems show DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3x, surpasses state-of-the-art solution quality across diverse scales, and cuts LLM adaptation costs by over 90% while maintaining superior accuracy under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: DASH successfully addresses key limitations of LHD by simultaneously improving solver efficiency, quality, and adaptation cost-effectiveness through dynamics-aware optimization and profiling-based retrieval.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the field of Combinatorial Optimization through automated heuristic generation. Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.

### [155] [More Bang for the Buck: Improving the Inference of Large Language Models at a Fixed Budget using Reset and Discard (ReD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21522)
*Sagi Meir,Tommer D. Keidar,Noam Levi,Shlomi Reuveni,Barak Hirshberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a method that improves LLM coverage per unit cost by addressing sublinear growth from power-law behavior in pass@k metrics, substantially reducing computational expenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pass@k metrics don't reflect budget constraints. Coverage@cost better captures performance at fixed budgets, but suffers from diminishing returns due to power-law behavior in pass@k, making optimization inefficient.

Method: The authors propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query strategy that boosts coverage@cost for any budget, can predict attempt savings given pass@k, and infer power-law exponents when pass@k is unknown.

Result: On HumanEval with three LLMs, ReD dramatically cuts required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach desired coverage, and provides efficient power-law measurement.

Conclusion: ReD offers a superior approach for budget-constrained LLM inference, overcoming diminishing returns with quantifiable cost savings and efficient metric estimation.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准多模态预训练对所有模态均等处理，但实际下游任务常仅重度使用单一模态，导致对关键模态的表征学习不充分

Method: FIP（Finetune-Informed Pretraining）：对目标模态采用更高掩码难度、更强损失权重和更大解码器容量，保持共享编码器不变且无需额外监督

Result: 在无线信号星座图掩码建模任务中，FIP持续提升下游微调性能，无需额外数据或计算资源

Conclusion: FIP实现简单、兼容现有架构，适用于各类多模态掩码建模流程，能有效优化关键模态表征

Abstract: Multimodal pretraining is effective for building general-purpose representations, but in many practical deployments, only one modality is heavily used during downstream fine-tuning. Standard pretraining strategies treat all modalities uniformly, which can lead to under-optimized representations for the modality that actually matters. We propose Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a model-agnostic method that biases representation learning toward a designated target modality needed at fine-tuning time. FIP combines higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently improves downstream fine-tuned performance with no extra data or compute. FIP is simple to implement, architecture-compatible, and broadly applicable across multimodal masked modeling pipelines.

Abstract: Developing new metal hydrides is a critical step toward efficient hydrogen storage in carbon-neutral energy systems. However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.

Result: 大量分析和实验结果表明，该方法在有效性和效率上持续优于现有静态分配策略。

Conclusion: 通过动态提示共享和协作优化，可以在保持任务特定特征的同时提高参数利用率并减轻知识遗忘。

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, most existing methods assign a fixed set of prompts to each task, completely isolating knowledge across tasks and resulting in suboptimal parameter utilization. To address this, we consider the practical needs of continual learning and propose a prompt-sharing framework. This framework constructs a global prompt pool and introduces a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts to achieve dynamic decoupling and collaborative optimization of task-specific feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a history-aware modulator that leverages cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, thereby mitigating inefficient parameter usage and knowledge forgetting. Extensive analysis and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing static allocation strategies in effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Precision oncology requires forecasting clinical events and trajectories, yet modeling sparse, multi-modal clinical time series remains a critical challenge. We introduce TwinWeaver, an open-source framework that serializes longitudinal patient histories into text, enabling unified event prediction as well as forecasting with large language models, and use it to build Genie Digital Twin (GDT) on 93,054 patients across 20 cancer types. In benchmarks, GDT significantly reduces forecasting error, achieving a median Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) of 0.87 compared to 0.97 for the strongest time-series baseline (p<0.001). Furthermore, GDT improves risk stratification, achieving an average concordance index (C-index) of 0.703 across survival, progression, and therapy switching tasks, surpassing the best baseline of 0.662. GDT also generalizes to out-of-distribution clinical trials, matching trained baselines at zero-shot and surpassing them with fine-tuning, achieving a median MASE of 0.75-0.88 and outperforming the strongest baseline in event prediction with an average C-index of 0.672 versus 0.648. Finally, TwinWeaver enables an interpretable clinical reasoning extension, providing a scalable and transparent foundation for longitudinal clinical modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM认证至关重要但充满挑战，因为LLM-as-a-Judge虽具可扩展性，但其评判器的缺陷、噪声和偏见会破坏统计保证，使得安全阈值验证难以可靠实现。

Method: 该框架利用小规模人工标注校准集估计评判器的TPR/FPR，推导出方差校正的临界阈值并应用于大规模评判器标注数据，将评判器行为显式建模为诊断工具而非黑箱估计器。

Abstract: Reliable certification of Large Language Models (LLMs)-verifying that failure rates are below a safety threshold-is critical yet challenging. While "LLM-as-a-Judge" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a "Noisy but Valid" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical "Oracle" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.

Motivation: 准确的无创颅内压（ICP）估计在重症监护中仍然是一个重大挑战，对于急性脑损伤患者具有重要临床意义。

Method: 提出机器学习框架：1）使用子空间系统辨识算法，利用动脉血压、脑血流速度和R-R间期信号识别脑血流动力学模型；2）通过凸优化学习无创信号特征与估计误差之间的映射函数，采用创新的排序约束。将多临床中心的患者数据随机分为训练集和测试集进行性能评估。

Result: 非线性约束映射结果显示：31.88%的测试样本估计误差在2 mmHg以内，34.07%在2-6 mmHg之间，合计约66%的估计误差控制在6 mmHg以内。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了所提无创ICP估计方法的可行性，为安全、广泛可及的ICP监测奠定了基础，但在临床应用前需要进一步验证和技术改进。

Abstract: Objective: Accurate noninvasive estimation of intracranial pressure (ICP) remains a major challenge in critical care. We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noninvasive ICP estimation approach. Significance: Further validation and technical refinement are required before clinical deployment, but this work lays the foundation for safe and broadly accessible ICP monitoring in patients with acute brain injury and related conditions.

Motivation: 二元分类是学习理论的基本问题。虽然可实现情形下的最优速率已明确，但不可知情形缺乏完整理论。本文旨在移除可实现性假设，填补这一空白。

Method: 作者通过移除可实现性假设，扩展了先前的分析，识别出最优速率的基本四分法，并发现概念类的简单组合性质决定了其所属速率类别。

Result: 论文证明，任何概念类的最优通用超额错误率必属四类之一：指数速率$e^{-n}$、超指数速率$e^{-o(n)}$、多项式速率$o(n^{-1/2)}$或任意慢速，并给出了相应的组合判定准则。

Conclusion: 不可知二元分类的最优通用速率完全由概念类的组合结构决定，呈现出根本性的四分法特征。

Abstract: We provide a complete theory of optimal universal rates for binary classification in the agnostic setting. This extends the realizable-case theory of Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van Handel, and Yehudayoff (2021) by removing the realizability assumption on the distribution. We identify a fundamental tetrachotomy of optimal rates: for every concept class, the optimal universal rate of convergence of the excess error rate is one of $e^{-n}$, $e^{-o(n)}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We further identify simple combinatorial structures which determine which of these categories any given concept class falls into.

### [163] [Monotone Optimisation with Learned Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20983)
*Ahmed Rashwan,Keith Briggs,Chris Budd,Lisa Kreusser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes HM-RI networks, a learning-based approach that integrates neural predictors into the Polyblock Outer Approximation algorithm for monotone optimization by directly estimating radial inverse projections, achieving substantial speed-ups while maintaining solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monotone optimization problems have specialized solvers like POA, but these require explicit functions that are often only available through data. Standard POA uses costly bisection for projections, making it difficult to apply directly in data-driven settings.

Method: Introduces algorithm-aware learning that integrates learned models into POA by predicting its projection primitive via radial inverse. Proposes Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks that enforce monotonicity and homogeneity properties, along with relaxed conditions to reduce training overhead.

Result: Provides theoretical characterization showing HM-RI predictors correspond to valid radial inverses. Achieves substantial speed-ups on benchmarks (indefinite quadratic programming, multiplicative programming, transmit power optimization) while maintaining strong solution quality and outperforming non-structure-exploiting baselines.

Conclusion: HM-RI networks successfully combine learning with POA for data-driven monotone optimization, enabling fast projection estimation while preserving monotonicity properties and solution quality.

Abstract: Monotone optimisation problems admit specialised global solvers such as the Polyblock Outer Approximation (POA) algorithm, but these methods typically require explicit objective and constraint functions. In many applications, these functions are only available through data, making POA difficult to apply directly. We introduce an algorithm-aware learning approach that integrates learned models into POA by directly predicting its projection primitive via the radial inverse, avoiding the costly bisection procedure used in standard POA. We propose Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks, structured neural architectures that enforce key monotonicity and homogeneity properties, enabling fast projection estimation. We provide a theoretical characterisation of radial inverse functions and show that, under mild structural conditions, a HM-RI predictor corresponds to the radial inverse of a valid set of monotone constraints. To reduce training overhead, we further develop relaxed monotonicity conditions that remain compatible with POA. Across multiple monotone optimisation benchmarks (indefinite quadratic programming, multiplicative programming, and transmit power optimisation), our approach yields substantial speed-ups in comparison to direct function estimation while maintaining strong solution quality, outperforming baselines that do not exploit monotonic structure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel abstraction integrates active inference into distributional reinforcement learning, enabling sample-efficient robotic control without explicit transition dynamics modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning is sample-inefficient and only addresses action planning, not sensory organization; active inference from neuroscience handles both but has been limited to model-based AI approaches.

Method: Proposes a formal abstraction unifying model-based, distributional, and model-free RL approaches to seamlessly embed active inference into distributional RL frameworks.

Result: Enables active inference's performance benefits in robotic control without requiring transition dynamics modeling.

Conclusion: Successfully bridges active inference with distributional RL, providing a more biologically plausible and sample-efficient solution for complex environment control.

Abstract: Optimal control of complex environments with robotic systems faces two complementary and intertwined challenges: efficient organization of sensory state information and far-sighted action planning. Because the reinforcement learning framework addresses only the latter, it tends to deliver sample-inefficient solutions. Active inference is the state-of-the-art process theory that explains how biological brains handle this dual problem. However, its applications to artificial intelligence have thus far been limited to extensions of existing model-based approaches. We present a formal abstraction of reinforcement learning algorithms that spans model-based, distributional, and model-free approaches. This abstraction seamlessly integrates active inference into the distributional reinforcement learning framework, making its performance advantages accessible without transition dynamics modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球大量儿童面临可预防发育延迟，但机器学习在新国家部署受限于数据瓶颈：可靠模型需数千样本，而新项目初始样本不足100

Method: 基于UNICEF调查数据，在44国357,709名儿童上预训练编码器；采用迁移学习边界理论解释预训练多样性如何促进小样本泛化

Result: 50样本时平均AUC 0.65（95%CI:0.56-0.72），超越冷启动梯度提升模型8-12%；500样本时AUC升至0.73；零样本迁移至新国家AUC最高达0.84

Conclusion: 预训练编码器显著提升资源受限场景下ML对SDG 4.2.1（儿童早期发展）监测的可行性，突破数据稀缺限制

Abstract: A large number of children experience preventable developmental delays each year, yet the deployment of machine learning in new countries has been stymied by a data bottleneck: reliable models require thousands of samples, while new programs begin with fewer than 100. We introduce the first pre-trained encoder for global child development, trained on 357,709 children across 44 countries using UNICEF survey data. With only 50 training samples, the pre-trained encoder achieves an average AUC of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.56-0.72), outperforming cold-start gradient boosting at 0.61 by 8-12% across regions. At N=500, the encoder achieves an AUC of 0.73. Zero-shot deployment to unseen countries achieves AUCs up to 0.84. We apply a transfer learning bound to explain why pre-training diversity enables few-shot generalization. These results establish that pre-trained encoders can transform the feasibility of ML for SDG 4.2.1 monitoring in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 针对精确评估代价高昂的场景，研究双预言机模型下的top-k项识别问题，提出自适应算法ACE和ACE-W，通过聚焦边界项和动态分配预算来减少高成本强预言机调用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要识别top-k项的场景中，精确评估（强预言机）代价昂贵且稀缺，而快速近似评估（弱预言机）存在噪声。如何在这种双预言机设置下最小化昂贵的强预言机调用次数是一个基本但具有挑战性的问题

Method: 首先分析screen-then-certify基准方法；建立条件化下界；提出ACE自适应认证算法，将强查询聚焦在临界边界项；进一步提出ACE-W两阶段方法，在运行ACE前自适应分配弱预言机预算

Result: 证明STC最多需要m(4ε_max)次强调用；建立Ω(m(ε_max))的条件化下界；ACE达到相同O(m(4ε_max))理论界且在实践中减少强调用；ACE-W进一步降低强预言机成本

Conclusion: 提出的自适应算法ACE和ACE-W通过智能地聚焦边界项和动态预算分配，在保持理论最优性的同时显著减少了昂贵强预言机的调用次数，实现了双预言机设置下的高效top-k识别

Abstract: Identifying the top-$k$ items is fundamental but often prohibitive when exact valuations are expensive. We study a two-oracle setting with a fast, noisy weak oracle and a scarce, high-fidelity strong oracle (e.g., human expert verification or expensive simulation). We first analyze a simple screen-then-certify baseline (STC) and prove it makes at most $m(4\varepsilon_{\max})$ strong calls given jointly valid weak confidence intervals with maximum radius $\varepsilon_{\max}$, where $m(\cdot)$ denotes the near-tie mass around the top-$k$ threshold. We establish a conditional lower bound of $Ω(m(\varepsilon_{\max}))$ for any algorithm given the same weak uncertainty. Our main contribution is ACE, an adaptive certification algorithm that focuses strong queries on critical boundary items, achieving the same $O(m(4\varepsilon_{\max}))$ bound while reducing strong calls in practice. We then introduce ACE-W, a fully adaptive two-phase method that allocates weak budget adaptively before running ACE, further reducing strong costs.

### [167] [The Depth Delusion: Why Transformers Should Be Wider, Not Deeper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20994)
*Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim,Md Rezaul Karim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals that optimal transformer architecture scaling follows distinct laws: width should grow 2.8x faster than depth, and beyond a critical depth (sublinear in width), adding layers actually increases loss despite adding parameters—a phenomenon called "Depth Delusion" that persists at 7B parameter scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard neural scaling laws treat architecture as interchangeable, ignoring that identical parameter counts can be achieved through different depth-width combinations. The paper aims to decompose these dependencies to understand optimal architecture scaling.

Method: Proposed architecture-conditioned scaling laws that explicitly model how optimal depth (D) and width (W) scale with compute budget (C). Empirically validated across 30 transformer architectures (17M to 7B parameters) with high-compute training samples.

Result: Found optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34 (2.8x faster). Discovered critical depth D_crit ~ W^0.44 beyond which adding layers increases loss (Depth Delusion). At 7B scale, a 64-layer model underperforms a 32-layer model by 0.12 nats despite having fewer parameters. Model achieved R² = 0.922.

Conclusion: Optimal depth-width tradeoffs persist at production scale, demonstrating that simply increasing depth beyond a critical point harms performance, and width should be prioritized over depth in large-scale transformer design.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws describe how language model loss decreases with parameters and data, but treat architecture as interchangeable--a billion parameters could arise from a shallow-wide model (10 layers & 8,192 hidden dimension) or a deep-narrow one (80 layers & 2,048 hidden dimension). We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth. We discover a critical depth phenomenon: beyond D_crit ~ W^0.44 (sublinear in W), adding layers increases loss despite adding parameters--the Depth Delusion. Empirically, we validate these findings across 30 transformer architectures spanning 17M to 7B parameters, each trained on representative high-compute samples, achieving R^2 = 0.922. Our central finding: at 7B scale, a 64-layer model (6.38B params) underperforms a 32-layer model (6.86B params) by 0.12 nats, despite being significantly deeper. This demonstrates that optimal depth-width tradeoffs persist at the production scale.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for computational materials discovery primarily evaluate static predictive tasks or isolated computational sub-tasks. While valuable, these evaluations neglect the inherently iterative and adaptive nature of scientific discovery. We introduce MAterials Discovery Environments (MADE), a novel framework for benchmarking end-to-end autonomous materials discovery pipelines. MADE simulates closed-loop discovery campaigns in which an agent or algorithm proposes, evaluates, and refines candidate materials under a constrained oracle budget, capturing the sequential and resource-limited nature of real discovery workflows. We formalize discovery as a search for thermodynamically stable compounds relative to a given convex hull, and evaluate efficacy and efficiency via comparison to baseline algorithms. The framework is flexible; users can compose discovery agents from interchangeable components such as generative models, filters, and planners, enabling the study of arbitrary workflows ranging from fixed pipelines to fully agentic systems with tool use and adaptive decision making. We demonstrate this by conducting systematic experiments across a family of systems, enabling ablation of components in discovery pipelines, and comparison of how methods scale with system complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出两个新基准测试ORDebug和ORBias，用于评估大语言模型在运筹学中的迭代调试能力和行为理性，发现领域特定的RLVR训练可使8B参数模型在性能上超越前沿API。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在运筹学领域的基准测试仅评估从问题描述到求解代码的一次性翻译，忽略了实际运筹学从业者通过迭代分析不可行子系统（IIS）来调试不可行模型的诊断循环过程，无法反映真实工作场景。

Method: 创建ORDebug基准（5000+问题，9种错误类型），评估迭代自我修正能力，提供可验证反馈；创建ORBias基准（2000个报童问题），测量系统性偏差；测试26个模型12000+样本；采用领域特定的RLVR训练和课程学习策略。

Result: 在ORDebug上，RLVR训练的8B模型超越前沿API：恢复率95.3% vs 86.2%（+9.1%），诊断准确率62.4% vs 47.8%（+14.6%），解决步数2.25 vs 3.78（快1.7倍）。在ORBias上，课程学习实现负向ID→OOD偏差漂移（-9.6%），系统性偏差从20.0%降至10.4%（减少48%）。

Conclusion: 基于可验证oracle的过程级评估能让针对性训练的效果超越单纯扩大模型规模，表明在运筹学领域，关注迭代调试过程比仅优化一次性生成更有效。

Abstract: Operations Research practitioners routinely debug infeasible models through an iterative process: analyzing Irreducible Infeasible Subsystems (\IIS{}), identifying constraint conflicts, and systematically repairing formulations until feasibility is achieved. Yet existing LLM benchmarks evaluate OR as one-shot translation -- given a problem description, generate solver code -- ignoring this diagnostic loop entirely. We introduce two benchmarks that place the \textbf{solver in the evaluation loop}. \textbf{\ORDebug{}} evaluates iterative self-correction through 5,000+ problems spanning 9 error types; each repair action triggers solver re-execution and \IIS{} recomputation, providing deterministic, verifiable feedback. \textbf{\ORBias{}} evaluates behavioral rationality through 2,000 newsvendor instances (1,000 ID + 1,000 OOD), measuring systematic deviations from closed-form optimal policies. Across 26 models and 12,000+ samples, we find that domain-specific RLVR training enables an 8B model to surpass frontier APIs: 95.3\% vs 86.2\% recovery rate (+9.1\%), 62.4\% vs 47.8\% diagnostic accuracy (+14.6\%), and 2.25 vs 3.78 steps to resolution (1.7$\times$ faster). On \ORBias{}, curriculum training achieves the only negative ID$\rightarrow$OOD bias drift among models evaluated (-9.6\%), reducing systematic bias by 48\% (from 20.0\% to 10.4\%). These results demonstrate that process-level evaluation with verifiable oracles enables targeted training that outperforms scale.

Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法将测试流视为独立样本，忽略了时序动态中蕴含的监督信号，无法充分利用数据的时间结构信息。

Method: 提出顺序感知测试时适应(OATTA)，将测试时适应建模为无梯度递归贝叶斯估计任务，使用学习的动态转移矩阵作为时序先验来优化基础模型预测；引入似然比门控(LLR)在无时序证据时回退到基础预测器，确保弱结构流中的安全性。该方法轻量、与模型无关，计算开销可忽略。

Result: 在图像分类、可穿戴生理信号分析和语言情感分析等广泛实验中，OATTA展现出通用性，一致提升现有基线方法，准确率最高提升6.35%。

Conclusion: 建模时序动态为测试时适应提供了超越传统顺序无关方法的关键正交信号，证明了利用时间结构信息的重要性。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enables pre-trained models to adjust to distribution shift by learning from unlabeled test-time streams. However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%. Our findings establish that modeling temporal dynamics provides a critical, orthogonal signal beyond standard order-agnostic TTA approaches.

*José Afonso,Pedro Viegas,Rodrigo Ventura,Vasco Guerra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Conditional Denoising Model (CDM) that learns physical manifold geometry for surrogate modeling, achieving superior physical consistency and efficiency compared to explicit physics-constrained methods without directly using governing equations during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surrogate modeling for complex physical systems faces a trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency, with existing approaches either failing to guarantee strict adherence to governing equations or not learning the underlying solution geometry.

Method: Introduces a generative Conditional Denoising Model trained to restore clean states from noisy ones, learning a vector field pointing toward valid solution subspaces. Uses a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into deterministic fixed-point iteration to project noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold.

Result: Validated on a low-temperature plasma benchmark, CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. The denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer, making the model adhere to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses, despite never seeing the governing equations during training.

Conclusion: CDM effectively learns physical manifold geometry and provides superior physical consistency through implicit regularization, offering a more efficient and effective alternative to explicit physics-constrained surrogate modeling approaches.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for complex physical systems typically faces a trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency. Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.

Conclusion: SIGMA-PPG有效解决了PPG信号的噪声和冗余挑战，为生理信号分析建立了强大的生成式基础模型框架

Abstract: Current foundation model for photoplethysmography (PPG) signals is challenged by the intrinsic redundancy and noise of the signal. Standard masked modeling often yields trivial solutions while contrastive methods lack morphological precision. To address these limitations, we propose a Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA-PPG), a generative foundation model featuring a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, where a reinforcement learning-driven teacher leverages statistical priors to create challenging learning paths that prevent overfitting to noise. We also incorporate a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to ensure that physiologically identical waveforms (even those altered by recording artifacts or minor perturbations) map to shared indices. This enhances codebook semantic density and eliminates redundant feature structures. Pre-trained on over 120,000 hours of data, SIGMA-PPG achieves superior average performance compared to five state-of-the-art baselines across 12 diverse downstream tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ZonghengGuo/SigmaPPG.

TL;DR: A constrained sampling framework (PPR) enforces physical laws in diffusion-based neural emulators during generation, reducing constraint violations by 10x while improving sample accuracy across scientific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla diffusion models for scientific emulation cannot guarantee physical accuracy or constraint satisfaction, risking invalid simulation results for critical applications like weather forecasting or PDE solving.

Method: Introduces a constrained forward diffusion process limited to feasible solutions, paired with Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR) - an iterative sampling algorithm alternating denoising, projection onto constraint sets, and renoising.

Result: PPR reduces constraint violations by over 10x compared to baselines while generating samples that better match true constrained distributions and improve consistency in 2D distributions, PDEs, and weather forecasting.

Conclusion: The framework ensures hard constraint satisfaction during generation, making neural emulators physically reliable for scientific applications without sacrificing sample quality.

Abstract: Neural emulators based on diffusion models show promise for scientific applications, but vanilla models cannot guarantee physical accuracy or constraint satisfaction. We address this by introducing a constrained sampling framework that enforces hard constraints, such as physical laws or observational consistency, at generation time. Our approach defines a constrained forward process that diffuses only over the feasible set of constraint-satisfying samples, inducing constrained marginal distributions. To reverse this, we propose Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR), an iterative algorithm that samples from the constrained marginals by alternating between denoising predictions, projecting onto the feasible set, and renoising. Experiments on 2D distributions, PDEs, and global weather forecasting demonstrate that PPR reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude while improving sample consistency and better matching the true constrained distribution compared to baselines.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在文本推理方面表现出色，但在细粒度空间理解和连续动作规划方面存在困难，无法模拟复杂视觉推理所需的动态过程。

Method: 研究者将视觉推理形式化为视频生成问题，提出生成的帧可以作为初始状态和解决方案之间的中间推理步骤。他们在两个不同任务上评估模型：迷宫导航（离散规划，低视觉变化）和七巧板拼图（连续操作，高视觉变化）。

Result: 实验揭示了三个关键发现：(1) 强大的零样本泛化能力；(2) 有效利用视觉上下文作为显式控制；(3) 在序列规划中存在测试时缩放定律，增加生成视频长度可以提升对复杂时空路径的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视频生成不仅是媒体工具，而是可扩展、可泛化的视觉推理范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models have excelled at textual reasoning, but they often struggle with fine-grained spatial understanding and continuous action planning, failing to simulate the dynamics required for complex visual reasoning. In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely a media tool, but a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning.

Motivation: 现有无监督神经组合优化方法存在根本矛盾：泛化模型推理高效但缺乏实例适应性，实例特定模型灵活但无法利用学习到的归纳结构且易陷入局部最优。此外，泛化模型作为测试时微调的暖启动效果不佳。

Method: TACO（Test-time Adaptation for Combinatorial Optimization）是一个模型无关框架，采用策略性热启动部分放松训练参数同时保持归纳偏置，在推理时实现快速无监督自适应。

Result: 在最小顶点覆盖和最大团等典型组合优化问题上，TACO在静态、分布偏移和动态场景中均优于naive微调泛化模型和从头训练实例特定模型，且计算成本可忽略不计。

Conclusion: TACO成功弥合了可泛化与实例特定无监督NCO范式之间的鸿沟，成为实际组合优化问题的实用框架。

Abstract: Unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) enables learning powerful solvers without access to ground-truth solutions. Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.

Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as accelerators for combinatorial optimization. To enable practical deployment, this work aims to reduce time-to-solution by addressing three challenges: (1) hardware topology, (2) spin selection and update algorithms, and (3) scalable coupling-coefficient precision. Restricted topologies require minor embedding; naive parallel updates can oscillate or stall; and limited precision can preclude feasible mappings or degrade solution quality.
  This work presents Snowball, a digital, scalable, all-to-all coupled Ising machine that integrates dual-mode Markov chain Monte Carlo spin selection with asynchronous spin updates to promote convergence and reduce time-to-solution. The digital architecture supports wide, configurable coupling precision, unlike many analog realizations at high bit widths. A prototype on an AMD Alveo U250 accelerator card achieves an 8$\times$ reduction in time-to-solution relative to a state-of-the-art Ising machine on the same benchmark instance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate feature engineering in tabular learning. Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations. Our evaluations on both the synthetic study and the real user study demonstrate that the proposed framework improves feature engineering performance across a variety of tabular datasets and reduces users' cognitive load during the feature engineering process.

TL;DR: 提出Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP)方法，通过局部优化和正向信号传播替代全局反向反馈，解决深度AI系统中文本梯度爆炸/消失问题，在长程工作流中实现更好的准确率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度复合AI系统中，全局文本反馈传播方法（如TextGrad）在系统深度增加时会出现性能下降，表现为文本梯度爆炸（反馈指数级增长）和梯度消失（长上下文能力限制导致信息丢失）两种失效模式。

Method: 提出文本平衡传播(TEP)，受能量模型平衡传播启发。包含两个阶段：1)自由阶段，局部LLM评论器迭代优化提示直至达到平衡；2)推动阶段，使用有界修改强度的近端提示编辑，通过正向信号而非反向反馈链传播任务级目标。

Result: 在长程QA基准和多智能体工具使用数据集上，TEP相比TextGrad等全局传播方法持续提升准确率和效率，且优势随深度增加而扩大，同时保持了黑盒LLM组件的实用性。

Conclusion: TEP有效缓解了深度扩展的失效模式，无需全局反向传播的計算负担和信号退化，即可实现局部优化与全局目标的受控适应，为深度复合AI系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as part of compound AI systems that coordinate multiple modules (e.g., retrievers, tools, verifiers) over long-horizon workflows. Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains. This design supports local prompt optimization followed by controlled adaptation toward global goals without the computational burden and signal degradation of global textual backpropagation. Across long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use dataset, TEP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency over global propagation methods such as TextGrad. The gains grows with depth, while preserving the practicality of black-box LLM components in deep compound AI system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This survey reviews graph foundation models (GFMs) from an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization perspective, categorizing approaches by task specification flexibility and summarizing strategies for handling distribution shifts in graph learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph learning models suffer from limited generalization when facing distribution shifts arising from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations.

Method: The survey organizes existing GFM approaches based on whether they operate under fixed task specifications or support heterogeneous task formulations, summarizes corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives, and reviews common evaluation protocols.

Result: Provides a unified problem setting for OOD generalization in graph learning, categorizes existing approaches, and identifies open research directions for future work.

Conclusion: This paper presents the first comprehensive survey specifically focused on OOD generalization in graph foundation models.

Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental data structure for representing relational information in domains such as social networks, molecular systems, and knowledge graphs. However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for OOD generalization in GFMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MapPFN is a prior-data fitted network pretrained on synthetic gene knockout data that uses in-context learning to predict post-perturbation gene expression distributions, matching the performance of models trained on real single-cell data without requiring gradient-based optimization at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-cell perturbation datasets cover limited biological contexts, and existing methods cannot adapt to new contexts or leverage new evidence during inference, making it difficult to plan effective biological interventions.

Method: Proposes MapPFN, a prior-data fitted network (PFN) meta-learned on synthetic data from a causal perturbation prior. It uses in-context learning to predict post-perturbation distributions without gradient-based optimization during inference.

Result: Despite being pretrained only on in silico gene knockouts, MapPFN successfully identifies differentially expressed genes and matches the performance of models trained on real single-cell perturbation data.

Conclusion: MapPFN demonstrates that meta-learning on synthetic data enables effective adaptation to unseen biological contexts at inference time, providing a powerful approach for predicting perturbation effects beyond training data limitations.

Abstract: Planning effective interventions in biological systems requires treatment-effect models that adapt to unseen biological contexts by identifying their specific underlying mechanisms. Yet single-cell perturbation datasets span only a handful of biological contexts, and existing methods cannot leverage new interventional evidence at inference time to adapt beyond their training data. To meta-learn a perturbation effect estimator, we present MapPFN, a prior-data fitted network (PFN) pretrained on synthetic data generated from a prior over causal perturbations. Given a set of experiments, MapPFN uses in-context learning to predict post-perturbation distributions, without gradient-based optimization. Despite being pretrained on in silico gene knockouts alone, MapPFN identifies differentially expressed genes, matching the performance of models trained on real single-cell data.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了安全强化学习算法在部署时存在安全泛化差距，并提出测试时屏蔽机制有效提升糖尿病管理场景下的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全强化学习算法通常在固定训练条件下评估，但实际部署时面临分布偏移问题，导致训练时安全策略在真实场景中可能失效，尤其在糖尿病管理等安全关键领域。

Method: 在统一临床模拟器上基准测试多种安全RL算法，提出测试时屏蔽机制（利用学习到的动力学模型过滤不安全动作），并在八种算法、三种糖尿病类型和三个年龄组中验证。

Result: 发现安全泛化差距：训练满足约束的策略在未见患者上频繁违反安全要求。测试时屏蔽使强基线（如PPO-Lag和CPO）的血糖达标时间提升13-14%，同时降低临床风险指数和血糖变异性。

Conclusion: 测试时屏蔽能有效恢复跨算法和患者群体的安全性，提供的模拟器与基准为研究安全关键控制领域的分布偏移问题提供了平台。

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are typically evaluated under fixed training conditions. We investigate whether training-time safety guarantees transfer to deployment under distribution shift, using diabetes management as a safety-critical testbed. We benchmark safe RL algorithms on a unified clinical simulator and reveal a safety generalization gap: policies satisfying constraints during training frequently violate safety requirements on unseen patients. We demonstrate that test-time shielding, which filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models, effectively restores safety across algorithms and patient populations. Across eight safe RL algorithms, three diabetes types, and three age groups, shielding achieves Time-in-Range gains of 13--14\% for strong baselines such as PPO-Lag and CPO while reducing clinical risk index and glucose variability. Our simulator and benchmark provide a platform for studying safety under distribution shift in safety-critical control domains.

*Shicheng Fan,Kun Zhang,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TRACE框架解决时序因果表征学习中的连续机制转换问题，通过混合专家模型和凸组合建模，实现未观测中间状态的因果变量与混合轨迹的联合识别，在合成和真实数据上达到0.99的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序因果表征学习方法假设因果机制在离散域间瞬时切换，但真实世界系统（如车辆转向、步态转换）往往呈现连续平滑过渡。这种离散假设限制了模型对实际动态系统的建模能力，无法捕捉机制间的渐变过程。

Method: 将过渡机制形式化为有限原子机制的凸组合，由时变混合系数控制；提出TRACE混合专家框架，每个专家学习一个原子机制，通过训练实现测试时机制轨迹的恢复。该方法可泛化到训练中未观测的中间机制状态。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据上，TRACE恢复的混合轨迹相关性高达0.99，显著优于离散切换基线方法，证明了连续机制建模的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 理论证明了潜在因果变量与连续混合轨迹的联合可识别性，TRACE框架为真实世界连续动态系统的因果表征学习提供了新范式，拓展了时序因果推断的应用边界。

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning methods assume that causal mechanisms switch instantaneously between discrete domains, yet real-world systems often exhibit continuous mechanism transitions. For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.

TL;DR: 针对机器学习原子间势能(MLIPs)的推理时间和内存消耗瓶颈，本文提出动态截断半径方法，通过靶向每个原子特定数量的邻居，实现2.26倍内存减少和2.04倍推理加速，同时保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLIPs在药物和材料发现中应用广泛，但面临推理时间和内存消耗两大瓶颈，限制了其应用于真实模拟尺度。传统固定截断半径的假设限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出动态截断半径公式，通过为每个原子靶向特定数量的邻居，在原子图上引入稀疏性，从而解决内存和推理时间问题。

Result: 在MACE、Nequip、Orbv3和TensorNet四种先进MLIPs上实现，内存消耗降低2.26倍，推理速度提升2.04倍，且在材料和分子数据集上精度下降极小。

Conclusion: 动态截断方法有效解决了MLIPs的两大瓶颈，在不显著损失精度的情况下实现了稳定的大规模分子动力学模拟，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have proven to be wildly useful for molecular dynamics simulations, powering countless drug and materials discovery applications. However, MLIPs face two primary bottlenecks preventing them from reaching realistic simulation scales: inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we address both issues by challenging the long-held belief that the cutoff radius for the MLIP must be held to a fixed, constant value. For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system. We also perform an extensive error analysis and find that the dynamic cutoff models exhibit minimal accuracy dropoff compared to their fixed cutoff counterparts on both materials and molecular datasets. All model implementations and training code will be fully open sourced.

TL;DR: 提出ME-POIs框架，通过融合大规模人类移动数据与语言模型生成的POI嵌入，同时学习地点的身份和功能表示，在五项地图增强任务中均优于现有方法，证明功能信息对通用POI表征至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地理空间基础模型主要关注静态文本元数据或轨迹上下文，无法捕捉POI的实际使用方式（即功能）。POI功能是一般化POI表征中缺失但关键的信号。

Method: ME-POIs框架将语言模型生成的POI嵌入与人类移动数据结合：1) 将个体访问编码为时序情境化嵌入；2) 通过对比学习将其与可学习的POI表征对齐以捕捉跨用户和时间的 usage patterns；3) 提出跨多空间尺度传播邻近高频访问POI的时序模式机制来解决长尾稀疏性问题。

Result: 在五项新提出的地图增强任务上，增强文本嵌入的ME-POIs始终优于纯文本和纯移动基线。仅基于移动数据训练的ME-POIs在某些任务上甚至超过纯文本模型。

Conclusion: POI功能信息是准确且可泛化的POI表征的关键组成部分，补充了传统的基于文本的身份信息，对构建通用地理空间基础模型具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent progress in geospatial foundation models highlights the importance of learning general-purpose representations for real-world locations, particularly points-of-interest (POIs) where human activity concentrates. Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.

Abstract: We study the problem of federated clustering when the total number of clusters $K$ across clients is unknown, and the clients have heterogeneous but potentially overlapping cluster sets in their local data. To that end, we develop FedGEM: a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for the training of mixture models with an unknown number of components. Our proposed algorithm relies on each of the clients performing EM steps locally, and constructing an uncertainty set around the maximizer associated with each local component. The central server utilizes the uncertainty sets to learn potential cluster overlaps between clients, and infer the global number of clusters via closed-form computations. We perform a thorough theoretical study of our algorithm, presenting probabilistic convergence guarantees under common assumptions. Subsequently, we study the specific setting of isotropic GMMs, providing tractable, low-complexity computations to be performed by each client during each iteration of the algorithm, as well as rigorously verifying assumptions required for algorithm convergence. We perform various numerical experiments, where we empirically demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to centralized EM, and that it outperforms various existing federated clustering methods.

Abstract: We study stochastic contextual logistic bandits under the simple regret objective. While simple regret guarantees have been established for the linear case, no such results were previously known for the logistic setting. Building on ideas from contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis, we propose the first algorithm that achieves simple regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\sqrt{T})$. Notably, the leading term of our regret bound is free of the constant $κ= \mathcal O(\exp(S))$, where $S$ is a bound on the magnitude of the unknown parameter vector. The algorithm is shown to be fully tractable when the action set is finite. We also introduce a new variant of Thompson Sampling tailored to the simple-regret setting. This yields the first simple regret guarantee for randomized algorithms in stochastic contextual linear bandits, with regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$. Extending this method to the logistic case, we obtain a similarly structured Thompson Sampling algorithm that achieves the same regret bound -- $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$ -- again with no dependence on $κ$ in the leading term. The randomized algorithms, as expected, are cheaper to run than their deterministic counterparts. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments to empirically validate these theoretical guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning method for early detection of emergent phenomena (seizures, churn, pandemics) that learns optimal features from covariance/precision matrix powers, proving structural consistency and achieving competitive results while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of emergent phenomena like epileptic seizures, customer churn, or pandemic outbreaks is challenging because they arise from hidden causal interactions in complex systems where the data-generating process is unknown and only partially observed.

Method: The method learns an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators (powers of empirical covariance or precision matrix) to tune into the underlying structure, followed by a supervised learning module for classification.

Result: The paper proves structural consistency of the family and demonstrates empirical success on seizure detection and churn prediction with competitive results. The approach shows good identifiability and captures structural signatures.

Conclusion: The method successfully reconciles predictive performance with interpretable statistical structure, enabling both accurate early detection of emergent phenomena and explainability of the underlying causal mechanisms.

Abstract: Emergent phenomena -- onset of epileptic seizures, sudden customer churn, or pandemic outbreaks -- often arise from hidden causal interactions in complex systems. We propose a machine learning method for their early detection that addresses a core challenge: unveiling and harnessing a system's latent causal structure despite the data-generating process being unknown and partially observed. The method learns an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators -- powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix -- offering a principled way to tune in to the underlying structure driving the emergence of critical events. A supervised learning module then classifies the learned representation. We prove structural consistency of the family and demonstrate the empirical soundness of our approach on seizure detection and churn prediction, attaining competitive results in both. Beyond prediction, and toward explainability, we ascertain that the optimal covariance power exhibits evidence of good identifiability while capturing structural signatures, thus reconciling predictive performance with interpretable statistical structure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes AC2L-GAD, an active counterfactual contrastive learning framework for graph anomaly detection that uses information-theoretic active selection and counterfactual reasoning to address limitations of random augmentations and naive negative sampling, achieving competitive performance while reducing computational cost by 65%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph anomaly detection struggles with label scarcity and extreme class imbalance. Existing graph contrastive learning methods have critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency, and naive negative sampling produces trivial contrasts, hindering effective anomaly detection.

Method: The authors propose AC2L-GAD, which combines information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation. It identifies structurally complex nodes, generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations and hard normal negative contrasts, and strategically restricts expensive counterfactual generation to a selected subset.

Result: Experiments on nine benchmark datasets (including GADBench financial transaction graphs) show AC2L-GAD achieves competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art baselines, with significant gains on datasets with complex attribute-structure anomaly interactions, while reducing computational overhead by approximately 65%.

Conclusion: AC2L-GAD effectively addresses the limitations of existing graph contrastive learning methods through principled counterfactual reasoning and active selection, delivering strong anomaly detection performance with substantially reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal patterns in networks, but faces significant challenges from label scarcity and extreme class imbalance. While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including real-world financial transaction graphs from GADBench, show that AC2L-GAD achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with notable gains in datasets where anomalies exhibit complex attribute-structure interactions.

TL;DR: 针对现有实体对齐模型缺乏迁移性、无法对齐未见知识图谱的问题，该文提出一种基于并行编码的实体对齐基础模型，利用种子实体对作为锚点引导信息流动，通过锚点条件消息传递缩短推理路径，并结合融合关系图和可学习交互模块实现跨知识图谱的实体对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实体对齐模型缺乏迁移性，无法在未重新训练的情况下对齐未见知识图谱；尽管图基础模型提供了解决方案，但直接适配效果不佳，存在"推理视距鸿沟"——实体对齐需要捕获稀疏异构知识图谱间的长程依赖关系，而非图基础模型所擅长的链接预测。

Method: 提出并行编码策略，以种子实体对齐对作为局部锚点引导信息流，同时初始化和编码两个并行流，实现锚点条件消息传递，利用局部结构邻近性替代全局搜索以缩短推理轨迹；同时引入融合关系图建模全局依赖关系，并设计可学习交互模块进行精确匹配。

Result: 大量实验验证了该框架的有效性，并展现出对未见知识图谱的强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该实体对齐基础模型通过并行编码策略有效弥合了推理视距鸿沟，实现了跨未见知识图谱的强迁移性实体对齐。

Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) is critical for knowledge graph (KG) fusion. Existing EA models lack transferability and are incapable of aligning unseen KGs without retraining. While using graph foundation models (GFMs) offer a solution, we find that directly adapting GFMs to EA remains largely ineffective. This stems from a critical "reasoning horizon gap": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its strong generalizability to unseen KGs.

### [190] [Flow Perturbation++: Multi-Step Unbiased Jacobian Estimation for High-Dimensional Boltzmann Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21177)
*Xin Peng,Ang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flow Perturbation++通过在概率流ODE中引入离散化步骤，在每个积分步进行无偏的雅可比估计，从而在保持无偏性的同时显著降低估计方差，进而提升高维系统（如1000维高斯混合模型和Chignolin蛋白）的平衡采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续归一化流（CNF）在无偏Boltzmann采样中因雅可比行列式计算需要D次反向传播而难以扩展到高维；现有随机雅可比估计器如Hutchinson虽然降低计算量但引入偏差，而Flow Perturbation虽无偏但方差高。

Method: 将概率流ODE离散化，在每个积分步执行无偏的逐步雅可比估计，形成多步构造，以保持无偏性并降低方差。

Result: 在1000维高斯混合模型和全原子Chignolin蛋白上，与Hutchinson基线和单步Flow Perturbation相比，Flow Perturbation++实现了显著更好的平衡采样性能。

Conclusion: Flow Perturbation++为CNF提供了一种方差降低的无偏雅可比估计方法，能够在高维系统中更高效地进行无偏Boltzmann采样。

Abstract: The scalability of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) for unbiased Boltzmann sampling remains limited in high-dimensional systems due to the cost of Jacobian-determinant evaluation, which requires $D$ backpropagation passes through the flow layers. Existing stochastic Jacobian estimators such as the Hutchinson trace estimator reduce computation but introduce bias, while the recently proposed Flow Perturbation method is unbiased yet suffers from high variance. We present \textbf{Flow Perturbation++}, a variance-reduced extension of Flow Perturbation that discretizes the probability-flow ODE and performs unbiased stepwise Jacobian estimation at each integration step. This multi-step construction retains the unbiasedness of Flow Perturbation while achieves substantially lower estimator variance. Integrated into a Sequential Monte Carlo framework, Flow Perturbation++ achieves significantly improved equilibrium sampling on a 1000D Gaussian Mixture Model and the all-atom Chignolin protein compared with Hutchinson-based and single-step Flow Perturbation baselines.

*Xin Peng,Ang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR), a post-hoc bias correction method for generative models that improves sample quality without altering the sampling trajectory, achieving state-of-the-art FID of 1.46 on MNIST with just one additional function evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models suffer from systematic biases that degrade sample quality, particularly in high-dimensional settings, and existing refinement methods often require noise injection or multi-step resampling which can be computationally expensive or alter the sampling dynamics.

Method: The authors propose a flow-matching-based Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR) framework with two strategies: (1) latent space alignment for approximately invertible generators, and (2) data space refinement trained with lightweight augmentations. The method preserves the original ODE trajectory and applies deterministic corrections to generated samples.

Result: Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ (256x256) show consistent improvements in fidelity and coverage. Specifically, starting from base samples with FID 3.95, latent space refinement achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.46 on MNIST using only a single additional function evaluation (1-NFE), while maintaining sample diversity.

Conclusion: Effective bias correction can be achieved as a post-hoc procedure without perturbing sampling dynamics, demonstrating that lightweight, deterministic refinement strategies can significantly improve generative model quality with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Generative models, including diffusion and flow-based models, often exhibit systematic biases that degrade sample quality, particularly in high-dimensional settings. We revisit refinement methods and show that effective bias correction can be achieved as a post-hoc procedure, without noise injection or multi-step resampling of the sampling process. We propose a flow-matching-based \textbf{Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR)} framework with two refinement strategies operating at different stages: latent space alignment for approximately invertible generators and data space refinement trained with lightweight augmentations. Unlike previous refiners that perturb sampling dynamics, BFR preserves the original ODE trajectory and applies deterministic corrections to generated samples. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ at 256x256 resolution demonstrate consistent improvements in fidelity and coverage; notably, starting from base samples with FID 3.95, latent space refinement achieves a \textbf{state-of-the-art} FID of \textbf{1.46} on MNIST using only a single additional function evaluation (1-NFE), while maintaining sample diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSVEP信号在不同被试间存在差异，且用户特定标注成本高昂，限制了识别性能。

Method: 提出跨被试自训练（CSST）框架，包含滤波器组欧氏对齐（FBEA）、对抗学习预训练（PTAL）、双集成自训练（DEST）以及时频增强对比学习（TFA-CL）模块。

Result: 在Benchmark和BETA数据集上，在不同信号长度下均达到先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了SSVEP-BCI中的跨被试变异性问题，降低了标注成本，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely used due to their high signal-to-noise ratio and user-friendliness. Accurate decoding of SSVEP signals is crucial for interpreting user intentions in BCI applications. However, signal variability across subjects and the costly user-specific annotation limit recognition performance. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method built upon the self-training paradigm. Specifically, a Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) strategy is designed to exploit frequency information from SSVEP filter banks. Then, we propose a Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) framework consisting of two stages: Pre-Training with Adversarial Learning (PTAL), which aligns the source and target distributions, and Dual-Ensemble Self-Training (DEST), which refines pseudo-label quality. Moreover, we introduce a Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL) module to enhance feature discriminability across multiple augmented views. Extensive experiments on the Benchmark and BETA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying signal lengths, highlighting its superiority.

TL;DR: The paper develops a cellular sheaf theoretic framework to analyze feature diffusion in geometric and topological deep learning, providing a topological perspective on local consistency and harmonicity with multiscale extensions for hierarchical feature interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training remains an open and underexplored problem, creating a gap in understanding how these architectures aggregate and propagate features.

Method: Introduces a cellular sheaf theoretic framework that tracks local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, plus a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis.

Result: The framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation, enabling joint characterization of GDL/TDL architectures based on their underlying geometric/topological structures and learned signals.

Conclusion: This approach provides insights for future studies on conventional tasks like node classification, substructure detection, and community detection.

Abstract: Combinatorial and topological structures, such as graphs, simplicial complexes, and cell complexes, form the foundation of geometric and topological deep learning (GDL and TDL) architectures. These models aggregate signals over such domains, integrate local features, and generate representations for diverse real-world applications. However, the distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training remains an open and underexplored problem. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models. This approach enables a joint characterization of GDL and TDL architectures based on their underlying geometric and topological structures and the learned signals defined on them, providing insights for future studies on conventional tasks such as node classification, substructure detection, and community detection.

*Mehmet Ergezer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了EEG解码中模型效率与鲁棒性的权衡：S5架构在长时序下实现高精度且参数高效，但跨任务泛化时过于自信；EEGXF架构虽精度略低却更保守稳定，适用于对不确定性敏感的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究自然场景EEG解码中模型架构与时序上下文的交互机制，解决实际应用中模型在跨被试、跨频率、跨任务场景下的鲁棒性挑战。

Method: 基于HBN电影观看数据集，在8s-128s多段长下对比CNN/LSTM/EEGXF/S4/S5五种架构的四分类性能；通过零样本跨频率迁移、跨任务分布外(OOD)测试和留一被试交叉验证评估鲁棒性。

Result: ① 长时序显著提升精度：64s时S5达98.7%±0.6（参数比CNN少20倍），CNN为98.3%±0.3；② S5跨被试精度最优但OOD任务产生过度自信错误；③ EEGXF在频率偏移下更保守稳定但分布内校准性较差。

Conclusion: 提出实践中的效率-鲁棒性权衡策略：追求峰值精度选S5，需稳健不确定性估计时选EEGXF，为真实场景EEG系统设计提供关键架构选择依据。

Abstract: We study how model architecture and temporal context interact in naturalistic EEG decoding. Using the HBN movie-watching dataset, we benchmark five architectures, CNN, LSTM, a stabilized Transformer (EEGXF), S4, and S5, on a 4-class task across segment lengths from 8s to 128s. Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution. These results reveal a practical efficiency-robustness trade-off: S5 for parameter-efficient peak accuracy; EEGXF when robustness and conservative uncertainty are critical.

*Kaiyuan Tan,Kendra Givens,Peilun Li,Thomas Beckers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHDME: a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework that combines Gaussian process physics models with diffusion models to forecast dynamical systems accurately even with sparse data and incomplete governing equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are unreliable with sparse data, while physics-informed ML requires explicit governing equations that are often only partially known due to complex nonlinear dynamics.

Method: A five-step framework: (1) Train GP-dPHS on limited observations to learn energy-based dynamics representation; (2) Generate physically consistent synthetic data for diffusion training; (3) Guide diffusion with structured physics residual loss; (4) Use trained diffusion model as amortized sampler/forecaster; (5) Apply split conformal calibration for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Experiments on PDE benchmarks and real-world spring system demonstrate improved forecasting accuracy and physical consistency under data scarcity.

Conclusion: PHDME successfully integrates data-driven diffusion models with physics-based port-Hamiltonian priors, enabling reliable trajectory forecasting without requiring complete governing equations.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide expressive priors for forecasting trajectories of dynamical systems, but are typically unreliable in the sparse data regime. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) improves reliability in such settings; however, most methods require \emph{explicit governing equations} during training, which are often only partially known due to complex and nonlinear dynamics. We introduce \textbf{PHDME}, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework designed for \emph{sparse observations} and \emph{incomplete physics}. PHDME leverages port-Hamiltonian structural prior but does not require full knowledge of the closed-form governing equations. Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss. After training, the diffusion model acts as an amortized sampler and forecaster for fast trajectory generation. Finally, we apply split conformal calibration to provide uncertainty statements for the generated predictions. Experiments on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system show improved accuracy and physical consistency under data scarcity.

TL;DR: 针对RLVR在有限rollout预算下探索效率低下的问题，本文提出LENS框架，通过识别并移除提示中的干扰token，将净化过程的成功经验迁移到原始噪声提示上，显著提升性能和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR虽提升了LLM推理能力，但在复杂任务中面临有限rollout预算下的低效探索问题，导致采样成功率低且训练不稳定。研究发现，许多探索失败源于少量引入干扰的提示token，而非问题本身难度。

Method: 提出Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS)，首先识别并移除提示中的干扰token，然后将净化过程中的成功rollout用于监督原始噪声提示上的策略优化，使模型学会在真实噪声环境中忽略干扰。

Result: LENS显著优于GRPO，平均性能提升3.88%，收敛速度提升超过1.6倍。

Conclusion: 去除干扰token对提升rollout效率至关重要，为RLVR研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning, but remains constrained by inefficient exploration under limited rollout budgets, leading to low sampling success and unstable training in complex tasks. We find that many exploration failures arise not from problem difficulty, but from a small number of prompt tokens that introduce interference. Building on this insight, we propose the Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS), which first prompts by identifying and removing interference tokens. then transfers successful rollouts from the purification process to supervise policy optimization on the original noisy prompts, enabling the model to learn to ignore interference in the real-world, noisy prompting settings. Experimental results show that LENS significantly outperforms GRPO, delivering higher performance and faster convergence, with a 3.88% average gain and over 1.6$\times$ speedup. Our work highlights the critical role of pruning interference tokens in improving rollout efficiency, offering a new perspective for RLVR research.

Motivation: 现有图注意力模型(GAM)仅考虑节点特征，在处理复杂图结构时存在局限性，无法充分利用边信息来提升路由问题求解性能。

Method: 泛化图注意力机制，提出EGAM模型：采用多头点积注意力同时更新节点和边嵌入；使用自回归编码器-解码器架构；通过带特殊基线的策略梯度算法进行强化学习训练。

Result: 在各类路由问题上，EGAM性能达到或超过现有方法，特别是在高约束问题上表现突出，验证了其在处理复杂图结构时的高效性。

Conclusion: EGAM通过整合边特征信息，显著提升了神经组合优化求解器的性能，为复杂约束路由问题提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) solvers, implemented with graph neural networks (GNNs), have introduced new approaches for solving routing problems. Trained with reinforcement learning (RL), the state-of-the-art graph attention model (GAM) achieves near-optimal solutions without requiring expert knowledge or labeled data. In this work, we generalize the existing graph attention mechanism and propose the extended graph attention model (EGAM). Our model utilizes multi-head dot-product attention to update both node and edge embeddings, addressing the limitations of the conventional GAM, which considers only node features. We employ an autoregressive encoder-decoder architecture and train it with policy gradient algorithms that incorporate a specially designed baseline. Experiments show that EGAM matches or outperforms existing methods across various routing problems. Notably, the proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance on highly constrained problems, highlighting its efficiency in handling complex graph structures.

Method: DUET采用知识蒸馏框架，训练学生模型模仿一个被特殊提示引导的教师模型，该教师能有效拒绝不良知识生成同时保留通用领域知识。

Result: 在现有基准测试和增强评估协议下，DUET在遗忘性能和效用保持方面均表现更优，且比最新去学习方法数据效率高数个数量级。

Conclusion: DUET通过蒸馏策略成功融合了调优式和上下文去学习的优点，为构建可信AI提供了高效实用的去学习解决方案。

Abstract: LLM unlearning is a technique to remove the impacts of undesirable knowledge from the model without retraining from scratch, which is indispensable towards trustworthy AI. Existing unlearning methods face significant limitations: conventional tuning-based unlearning is computationally heavy and prone to catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, in-contextualized unlearning is lightweight for precise unlearning but vulnerable to prompt removal or reverse engineering attacks. In response, we propose Distilled Unlearning from an Efficient Teacher (DUET), a novel distillation-based unlearning method that combines the merits of these two lines of work. It learns a student model to imitate the behavior of a prompt-steered teacher that effectively refuses undesirable knowledge generation while preserving general domain knowledge. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks with our enriched evaluation protocols demonstrate that DUET achieves higher performance in both forgetting and utility preservation, while being orders of magnitude more data-efficient than state-of-the-art unlearning methods.

Conclusion: Zenith是一种可扩展且高效的排序架构，能以最小运行时开销学习复杂特征交互，在工业级应用中验证了有效性。

Abstract: Accurately capturing feature interactions is essential in recommender systems, and recent trends show that scaling up model capacity could be a key driver for next-level predictive performance. While prior work has explored various model architectures to capture multi-granularity feature interactions, relatively little attention has been paid to efficient feature handling and scaling model capacity without incurring excessive inference latency. In this paper, we address this by presenting Zenith, a scalable and efficient ranking architecture that learns complex feature interactions with minimal runtime overhead. Zenith is designed to handle a few high-dimensional Prime Tokens with Token Fusion and Token Boost modules, which exhibits superior scaling laws compared to other state-of-the-art ranking methods, thanks to its improved token heterogeneity. Its real-world effectiveness is demonstrated by deploying the architecture to TikTok Live, a leading online livestreaming platform that attracts billions of users globally. Our A/B test shows that Zenith achieves +1.05%/-1.10% in online CTR AUC and Logloss, and realizes +9.93% gains in Quality Watch Session / User and +8.11% in Quality Watch Duration / User.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents TimeSliver, a novel explainable AI framework for time-series classification that jointly uses raw data and symbolic abstraction to create a representation where each element linearly encodes the contribution of temporal segments, achieving superior explainability and competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-hoc explainable methods for time-series suffer from reference state sensitivity and ignore sequential dependencies, while self-attention mechanisms often fail to provide faithful temporal importance measures, limiting transparency and model understanding.

Method: TimeSliver is an explainability-driven deep learning framework that jointly processes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation preserving temporal structure, where each element linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to predictions.

Result: TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 synthetic/real-world datasets and achieves predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines across 26 UEA benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: TimeSliver is positioned as a strong and explainable framework for general time-series classification, successfully balancing model performance with interpretability.

Abstract: Identifying the extent to which every temporal segment influences a model's predictions is essential for explaining model decisions and increasing transparency. While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure. Each element in this representation linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to the final prediction, allowing us to assign a meaningful importance score to every time point. For time-series classification, TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 distinct synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets. TimeSliver also achieves predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines across 26 UEA benchmark datasets, positioning it as a strong and explainable framework for general time-series classification.

Motivation: 旋转机械可靠性预测面临非平稳工况、跨域漂移和严重类别不平衡等挑战，需要保持低且可预测的误报率，同时提供准确的早期预警信号。

Conclusion: 通过物理对齐表征与EVT校准决策规则的结合，PG-TMT为可靠性中心的预测健康管理提供了校准、可解释且可部署的早期预警解决方案。

Abstract: Reliability-centered prognostics for rotating machinery requires early warning signals that remain accurate under nonstationary operating conditions, domain shifts across speed/load/sensors, and severe class imbalance, while keeping the false-alarm rate small and predictable. We propose the Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer (PG-TMT), a compact tri-branch encoder tailored for online condition monitoring. A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility and provides physics-grounded explanations. To ensure decision reliability, healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter. Under a leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring of missed detections on CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot, PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC (primary under imbalance), competitive or better ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, together with strong cross-domain transfer. By coupling physics-aligned representations with EVT-calibrated decision rules, PG-TMT delivers calibrated, interpretable, and deployment-ready early warnings for reliability-centric prognostics and health management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid quantum-classical models suffer from tightly coupled architectures and task-specific encoders, limiting conceptual clarity, generality, and transferability across learning settings.

Method: Introduces a modular, architecture-agnostic framework treating classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks: a pre-trained frozen classical neural network as a feature block, and a variational quantum circuit (VQC) as a trainable adaptive module operating on structured representations rather than raw inputs.

Result: Develops block-wise generalization theory decomposing error into approximation and estimation components; identifies conditions for quantum representational advantages; empirical validation shows stable optimization, reduced qubit sensitivity, and noise robustness on quantum dot classification.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models, enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources, and demonstrates practical benefits through systematic block-swap experiments and improved performance characteristics.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical learning models increasingly integrate neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to exploit complementary inductive biases. However, many existing approaches rely on tightly coupled architectures or task-specific encoders, limiting conceptual clarity, generality, and transferability across learning settings. In this work, we introduce Quantum LEGO Learning, a modular and architecture-agnostic learning framework that treats classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks with well-defined roles. Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs. This separation enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources and provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models. We develop a block-wise generalization theory that decomposes learning error into approximation and estimation components, explicitly characterizing how the complexity and training status of each block influence overall performance. Our analysis generalizes prior tensor-network-specific results and identifies conditions under which quantum modules provide representational advantages over comparably sized classical heads. Empirically, we validate the framework through systematic block-swap experiments across frozen feature extractors and both quantum and classical adaptive heads. Experiments on quantum dot classification demonstrate stable optimization, reduced sensitivity to qubit count, and robustness to realistic noise.

Conclusion: 该理论能准确预测不同条件下的恢复性能，为PLS能否从不完整多模态数据中可靠提取共享信号提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) learns shared structure from paired data via the top singular vectors of the empirical cross-covariance (PLS-SVD), but multimodal datasets often have missing entries in both views. We study PLS-SVD under independent entry-wise missing-completely-at-random masking in a proportional high-dimensional spiked model. After appropriate normalization, the masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix whose effective signal strength is attenuated by $\sqrtρ$, where $ρ$ is the joint entry retention probability. As a result, PLS-SVD exhibits a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a critical signal-to-noise threshold the leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative, while above it they achieve nontrivial alignment with the latent shared directions, with closed-form asymptotic overlap formulas. Simulations and semi-synthetic multimodal experiments corroborate the predicted phase diagram and recovery curves across aspect ratios, signal strengths, and missingness levels.

Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) seeks to create a compact dataset from a large, real-world dataset. While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 6.1\% performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach on ImageNet-1K dataset using ResNet-18.

TL;DR: 本文通过引入懒惰动态变换和实例依赖的半范数，建立了同步和异步Q-learning在平均奖励马尔可夫决策过程中的最优样本复杂度界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平均奖励MDP中贝尔曼算子缺乏收缩性是一个根本性挑战，现有方法要么需要强假设来强制半范数收缩，要么依赖折扣或回合制MDP作为近似，导致次优的样本复杂度。

Method: 作者提出一种懒惰MDP变换（系统以固定概率保持在当前状态），并构造一个实例依赖的半范数，证明在此半范数下贝尔曼算子具有一步收缩性，从而分析从懒惰动态中采样的同步和异步Q-learning变体。

Conclusion: 该研究为平均奖励Q-learning提供了首个最优样本复杂度界，表明懒惰动态与实例依赖半范数分析的结合能够克服该领域的根本性收缩性挑战。

Abstract: We present the convergence rates of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning for average-reward Markov decision processes, where the absence of contraction poses a fundamental challenge. Existing non-asymptotic results overcome this challenge by either imposing strong assumptions to enforce seminorm contraction or relying on discounted or episodic Markov decision processes as successive approximations, which either require unknown parameters or result in suboptimal sample complexity. In this work, under a reachability assumption, we establish optimal $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees (up to logarithmic factors) for a simple variant of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning that samples from the lazified dynamics, where the system remains in the current state with some fixed probability. At the core of our analysis is the construction of an instance-dependent seminorm and showing that, after a lazy transformation of the Markov decision process, the Bellman operator becomes one-step contractive under this seminorm.

Abstract: This paper investigates search in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). Conventional wisdom holds that long-term predictions and compounding errors are the primary obstacles for model-based RL. We challenge this view, showing that search is not a plug-and-play replacement for a learned policy. Surprisingly, we find that search can harm performance even when the model is highly accurate. Instead, we show that mitigating distribution shift matters more than improving model or value function accuracy. Building on this insight, we identify key techniques for enabling effective search, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple popular benchmark domains.

Conclusion: TGCC通过因果不变性机制有效提升了图数据压缩的可迁移性和泛化能力，为大规模图数据的实际应用提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing scale of graph datasets has significantly improved the performance of graph representation learning methods, but it has also introduced substantial training challenges. Graph dataset condensation techniques have emerged to compress large datasets into smaller yet information-rich datasets, while maintaining similar test performance. However, these methods strictly require downstream applications to match the original dataset and task, which often fails in cross-task and cross-domain scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel causal-invariance-based and transferable graph dataset condensation method, named \textbf{TGCC}, providing effective and transferable condensed datasets. Specifically, to preserve domain-invariant knowledge, we first extract domain causal-invariant features from the spatial domain of the graph using causal interventions. Then, to fully capture the structural and feature information of the original graph, we perform enhanced condensation operations. Finally, through spectral-domain enhanced contrastive learning, we inject the causal-invariant features into the condensed graph, ensuring that the compressed graph retains the causal information of the original graph. Experimental results on five public datasets and our novel \textbf{FinReport} dataset demonstrate that TGCC achieves up to a 13.41\% improvement in cross-task and cross-domain complex scenarios compared to existing methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 out of 6 datasets in the single dataset and task scenario.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between theoretical models and real-world AET fleet operations by enabling adaptive management under dynamic charging infrastructure conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, the effective management of Autonomous Electric Taxi (AET) fleets faces a critical challenge in environments with dynamic and uncertain charging availability. While most existing research assumes a static charging network, this simplification creates a significant gap between theoretical models and real-world operations. To bridge this gap, we propose GAT-PEARL, a novel meta-reinforcement learning framework that learns an adaptive operational policy. Our approach integrates a graph attention network (GAT) to effectively extract robust spatial representations under infrastructure layouts and model the complex spatiotemporal relationships of the urban environment, and employs probabilistic embeddings for actor-critic reinforcement learning (PEARL) to enable rapid, inference-based adaptation to changes in charging network layouts without retraining. Through extensive simulations on real-world data in Chengdu, China, we demonstrate that GAT-PEARL significantly outperforms conventional reinforcement learning baselines, showing superior generalization to unseen infrastructure layouts and achieving higher overall operational efficiency in dynamic settings.

Conclusion: 该框架兼具多源和单源域适应场景适用性，为数据稀缺条件下的域适应问题提供了鲁棒解决方案

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a statistical learning problem when the distribution of training (source) data is different from that of test (target) data. In this setting, one has access to labeled data only from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. The central objective is to leverage the source data and the unlabeled target data to build models that generalize to the target domain. Despite its potential, existing UDA approaches often struggle in practice, particularly in scenarios where the target domain offers only limited unlabeled data or spurious correlations dominate the source domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel distributionally robust learning framework that models uncertainty in both the covariate distribution and the conditional label distribution. Our approach is motivated by the multi-source domain adaptation setting but is also directly applicable to the single-source scenario, making it versatile in practice. We develop an efficient learning algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with existing UDA methods. Extensive experiments under various distribution shift scenarios show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, especially when target data are extremely scarce.

Motivation: Urban congestion requires seamless door-to-door travel through integration of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) with ground transportation, but research on optimal integrated routing strategies remains limited and lacks systematic exploration.

Method: A unified optimization model for air-ground strategy selection combined with the UAGMC framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning and V2X communication to optimize vertiport selection and dynamically plan air taxi routes.

Result: The UAGMC framework achieves a 34% reduction in average travel time compared to conventional proportional allocation methods, significantly improving overall travel efficiency.

Conclusion: This work provides novel insights into multimodal transportation system integration and establishes a foundation for intelligent urban mobility solutions through coordinated air-ground transportation, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has emerged as a transformative solution to alleviate urban congestion by utilizing low-altitude airspace, thereby reducing pressure on ground transportation networks. To enable truly efficient and seamless door-to-door travel experiences, UAM requires close integration with existing ground transportation infrastructure. However, current research on optimal integrated routing strategies for passengers in air-ground mobility systems remains limited, with a lack of systematic exploration.To address this gap, we first propose a unified optimization model that integrates strategy selection for both air and ground transportation. This model captures the dynamic characteristics of multimodal transport networks and incorporates real-time traffic conditions alongside passenger decision-making behavior. Building on this model, we propose a Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) framework, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vertiport selection and dynamically plan air taxi routes. Experimental results demonstrate that UAGMC achieves a 34\% reduction in average travel time compared to conventional proportional allocation methods, enhancing overall travel efficiency and providing novel insights into the integration and optimization of multimodal transportation systems. This work lays a solid foundation for advancing intelligent urban mobility solutions through the coordination of air and ground transportation modes.

Motivation: 控制扩散模型的记忆化对于需要生成数据与训练分布紧密匹配的应用至关重要。现有方法主要关注数据或模型层面的修改，将扩散模型视为孤立预测器。而均匀 timestep 采样由于信噪比差异导致去噪步骤间学习贡献不均，使训练偏向记忆化。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性和有效性，为控制扩散模型记忆化提供了新的去噪中心视角。

Abstract: Controlling memorization in diffusion models is critical for applications that require generated data to closely match the training distribution. Existing approaches mainly focus on data centric or model centric modifications, treating the diffusion model as an isolated predictor. In this paper, we study memorization in diffusion models from a denoising centric perspective. We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off. Experiments on image and 1D signal generation tasks demonstrate that shifting learning emphasis toward later denoising steps consistently reduces memorization and improves distributional alignment with training data, validating the generality and effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现代MoE系统采用线性路由器在高维表征空间中存在表征失配、角度集中和尺度敏感评分等问题，这些问题会损害路由判别能力和稳定的专家专业化。

Method: L2R在共享低秩潜路由空间中进行专家分配，引入饱和内积评分(SIPS)显式控制路由函数的Lipschitz行为，并集成参数高效的多锚点路由机制以增强专家表达能力。

Result: 在大规模语言MoE模型和ImageNet视觉MoE设置上的广泛实验表明，L2R持续提升了路由稳定性、专家专业化以及整体模型性能。

Conclusion: L2R是一个统一的、有效的路由框架，通过重塑路由空间和评分几何结构，解决了MoE模型的关键挑战，实现了更优性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale neural networks by conditionally activating a small subset of experts, where the router plays a central role in determining expert specialization and overall model performance. However, many modern MoE systems still adopt linear routers in raw high-dimensional representation spaces, where representation mismatch, angular concentration, and scale-sensitive scoring can jointly undermine routing discriminability and stable expert specialization. In this work, we propose Low-rank \& Lipschitz-controlled Routing (L2R), a unified routing framework that reshapes both the routing space and scoring geometry. L2R performs expert assignment in a shared low-rank latent routing space and introduces Saturated Inner-Product Scoring (SIPS) to explicitly control the Lipschitz behavior of routing functions, yielding smoother and more stable routing geometry. In addition, L2R incorporates a parameter-efficient multi-anchor routing mechanism to enhance expert expressiveness. Extensive experiments on a large-scale language MoE model and a vision MoE setting on ImageNet demonstrate that L2R consistently improves routing stability, expert specialization, and overall model performance.

Abstract: A reliable reward model is essential for aligning large language models with human preferences through reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, standard reward models are susceptible to spurious features that are not causally related to human labels. This can lead to reward hacking, where high predicted reward does not translate into better behavior. In this work, we address this problem from a causal perspective by proposing a factored representation learning framework that decomposes the model's contextual embedding into (1) causal factors that are sufficient for reward prediction and (2) non-causal factors that capture reward-irrelevant attributes such as length or sycophantic bias. The reward head is then constrained to depend only on the causal component. In addition, we introduce an adversarial head trained to predict reward from the non-causal factors, while applying gradient reversal to discourage them from encoding reward-relevant information. Experiments on both mathematical and dialogue tasks demonstrate that our method learns more robust reward models and consistently improves downstream RLHF performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Analyses on length and sycophantic bias further validate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating reward hacking behaviors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework to optimize the resource allocation ratio between Attention and FFN layers in disaggregated LLM architectures (AFD), showing that the derived closed-form solution reduces idle time and improves throughput by matching simulation results within 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Attention-FFN disaggregation (AFD) enables independent scaling of memory and compute resources for LLM decoding, its performance is highly sensitive to the Attention/FFN provisioning ratio. Misconfiguration causes step-level blocking and costly device idle time, creating a critical bottleneck for system efficiency.

Method: The authors develop a tractable analytical framework using a probabilistic workload model to derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio in an rA-1F topology. The model accounts for the nonstationary nature of Attention work (growing token context, random request lengths) versus stable FFN work. Validation is performed using a trace-calibrated AFD simulator.

Result: The theoretical optimal A/F ratio matches the simulation-optimal within 10% across various workloads and consistently reduces device idle time, demonstrating high accuracy and practical effectiveness of the analytical framework.

Conclusion: The proposed analytical framework successfully provides practical, closed-form guidelines for sizing AFD systems to maximize average throughput per instance, addressing the key challenge of resource provisioning in disaggregated LLM architectures.

Abstract: Attention-FFN disaggregation (AFD) is an emerging architecture for LLM decoding that separates state-heavy, KV-cache-dominated Attention computation from stateless, compute-intensive FFN computation, connected by per-step communication. While AFD enables independent scaling of memory and compute resources, its performance is highly sensitive to the Attention/FFN provisioning ratio: mis-sizing induces step-level blocking and costly device idle time. We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch. Using a probabilistic workload model, we derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance across the system. A trace-calibrated AFD simulator validates the theory: across workloads, the theoretical optimal A/F ratio matches the simulation-optimal within 10%, and consistently reduces idle time.

Abstract: The forward pass of a Transformer can be seen as an interacting particle system on the unit sphere: time plays the role of layers, particles that of token embeddings, and the unit sphere idealizes layer normalization. In some weight settings the system can even be seen as a gradient flow for an explicit energy, and one can make sense of the infinite context length (mean-field) limit thanks to Wasserstein gradient flows. In this paper we study the effect of the perceptron block in this setting, and show that critical points are generically atomic and localized on subsets of the sphere.

TL;DR: FedGALA proposes a federated graph foundational model framework that aligns GNNs and frozen PLMs via unsupervised contrastive learning in a continuous space, combined with prompt tuning to avoid quantization loss and achieve up to 14.37% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FedGFMs using vector-quantized backbones suffer irreversible knowledge loss during quantization. There is a need to reconcile semantic-structural orthogonality between PLMs and GNNs while addressing severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints in distributed, privacy-restricted environments.

Method: FedGALA employs unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, then uses a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs for downstream task adaptation.

Result: The framework outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks, achieving up to 14.37% performance improvement.

Conclusion: FedGALA successfully resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity issues in federated settings, capturing robust transferable knowledge while avoiding the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent studies of federated graph foundational models (FedGFMs) break the idealized and untenable assumption of having centralized data storage to train graph foundation models, and accommodate the reality of distributed, privacy-restricted data silos. Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments.
  To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.

Conclusion: 该模型能有效处理多变量时间序列预测问题，通过分离处理不同变量并利用各自信息特征，显著提升了预测精度。

Abstract: Multivariate time-series forecasting, as a typical problem in the field of time series prediction, has a wide range of applications in weather forecasting, traffic flow prediction, and other scenarios. However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, its performance in real-world scenarios is further validated using a private dataset collected by ourselves, which contains the test items' information on laptop motherboards.

TL;DR: Proposes IRPO, a policy optimization framework using multiple intrinsic rewards to directly optimize for extrinsic rewards in sparse-reward environments, avoiding subpolicy pretraining and improving sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse rewards make reinforcement learning exploration difficult; existing intrinsic reward methods suffer from unstable credit assignment (when combined with extrinsic rewards) or sample inefficiency/sub-optimality (in hierarchical subpolicy approaches).

Method: Introduces Intrinsic Reward Policy Optimization (IRPO), a framework leveraging multiple intrinsic rewards via a surrogate policy gradient to provide more informative learning signals for direct extrinsic reward optimization, eliminating the need for pretraining subpolicies.

Result: IRPO demonstrates improved performance and sample efficiency compared to baselines across discrete and continuous environments; formal analysis of the optimization problem is provided.

Conclusion: IRPO effectively addresses sparse-reward exploration by unifying intrinsic rewards into policy optimization, offering a more stable and sample-efficient solution than prior methods.

Abstract: Exploration is essential in reinforcement learning as an agent relies on trial and error to learn an optimal policy. However, when rewards are sparse, naive exploration strategies, like noise injection, are often insufficient. Intrinsic rewards can also provide principled guidance for exploration by, for example, combining them with extrinsic rewards to optimize a policy or using them to train subpolicies for hierarchical learning. However, the former approach suffers from unstable credit assignment, while the latter exhibits sample inefficiency and sub-optimality. We propose a policy optimization framework that leverages multiple intrinsic rewards to directly optimize a policy for an extrinsic reward without pretraining subpolicies. Our algorithm -- intrinsic reward policy optimization (IRPO) -- achieves this by using a surrogate policy gradient that provides a more informative learning signal than the true gradient in sparse-reward environments. We demonstrate that IRPO improves performance and sample efficiency relative to baselines in discrete and continuous environments, and formally analyze the optimization problem solved by IRPO.

TL;DR: 针对大型推理模型在处理简单任务时过度思考导致资源浪费的问题，本文提出基于强化学习的难度感知策略优化框架DiPO，通过模型自推理建模任务复杂度并调整生成偏好，显著减少冗余推理token而不损失性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型(LRMs)在简单任务上会出现过度思考现象，产生不必要的冗长推理和资源浪费，这源于后训练奖励函数引发的生成偏好。现有研究低估了任务难度感知的重要性，难以让模型有效分配推理资源

Method: 提出Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO)强化学习训练框架，包含基于模型自推理的难度建模方法（减少人工标注依赖）和难度信号增强的奖励函数（在考虑推理性能和输出格式的同时惩罚冗长推理）

Result: 实验表明DiPO能促使模型自发调整推理开销，在保持性能的前提下显著减少冗余token生成，实现思考压缩

Conclusion: DiPO框架通过难度感知有效解决了LRMs的过度思考问题，为模型推理资源的智能分配提供了新思路

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve explicit chain-of-thought expansion by imitating deep thinking behaviors of humans, demonstrating excellent performance in complex task scenarios. However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks. This overthinking phenomenon may arise from the generation preference triggered by the reward function during post-training. Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format. Experimental results indicate that DiPO enables the model to spontaneously adjust inference overhead, significantly reducing redundant tokens without losing performance due to thought compression.

### [220] [Revisiting Diffusion Model Predictions Through Dimensionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21419)
*Qing Jin,Chaoyang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于广义预测框架的理论解释，说明在高维设置下直接数据预测(x)优于噪声(ε)和速度(v)预测的原因，并开发了k-Diff框架来自动从数据中学习最优预测目标，在图像生成任务中超越固定目标基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流匹配模型在高维场景中显示出从噪声/速度预测转向直接数据预测的趋势，但缺乏关于最优预测目标为何依赖于数据特性的形式化解释。此外，流形数据的本征维度在实践中难以估计，导致预测目标选择困难。

Method: 1) 建立广义预测框架，将ε、v、x预测统一为特例；2) 推导数据几何结构与最优预测目标之间的解析关系；3) 提出k-Diff框架，采用数据驱动方式直接学习最优预测参数k，绕过显式维度估计。

Result: 理论证明维度是决定最优预测目标的关键因素：当环境维度显著超过本征维度时，x预测更优。在潜空间和像素空间图像生成实验中，k-Diff在不同架构和数据规模下均持续优于固定目标基线。

Conclusion: 工作为预测目标选择提供了严格理论依据，k-Diff提供了一种无需显式维度估计的、原则性的自动化方法来提升生成模型性能，具有普适性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion and flow matching models have highlighted a shift in the preferred prediction target -- moving from noise ($\varepsilon$) and velocity (v) to direct data (x) prediction -- particularly in high-dimensional settings. However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance.

*Zihao Huang,Jundong Zhou,Xingwei Qu,Qiyang Min,Ge Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConceptMoE通过动态合并语义相似的token为概念表示，实现token级别的计算分配，在保持计算量不变的情况下提升性能，同时减少注意力计算和KV缓存，实现显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型对所有token均匀分配计算资源，忽略了部分序列可轻松预测而另一些需要深度推理的事实，导致计算效率低下。

Method: 提出ConceptMoE，通过可学习的chunk模块基于token间相似度识别最优边界，将序列按目标压缩比R压缩后送入概念模型；利用MoE架构重新分配节省的计算量，使其与基线模型的激活FLOPs和总参数量匹配，以隔离架构本身的收益。

Result: 在语言预训练、长上下文理解和多模态任务上分别提升+0.9、+2.3和+0.6分；持续训练结合层循环可达+5.5分；注意力计算减少R²倍，KV缓存减少R倍；R=2时prefill速度提升175%，解码速度提升117%。

Conclusion: 最小化架构修改使其易于集成到现有MoE中，证明自适应概念级处理能从根本上提升大语言模型的效果和效率。

Abstract: Large language models allocate uniform computation across all tokens, ignoring that some sequences are trivially predictable while others require deep reasoning. We introduce ConceptMoE, which dynamically merges semantically similar tokens into concept representations, performing implicit token-level compute allocation. A learnable chunk module identifies optimal boundaries by measuring inter-token similarity, compressing sequences by a target ratio $R$ before they enter the compute-intensive concept model. Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to $R^2\times$ and KV cache by $R\times$. At $R=2$, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175\% and decoding speedups up to 117\% on long sequences. The minimal architectural modifications enable straightforward integration into existing MoE, demonstrating that adaptive concept-level processing fundamentally improves both effectiveness and efficiency of large language models.

*Hang Ni,Weijia Zhang,Fei Wang,Zezhi Shao,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MADI, a multi-modal LLM that enhances time series understanding by aligning numerical data with visual plots through patch-level correspondence, disentangling shared and modality-specific semantics via discrete latents, and highlighting critical tokens, achieving superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective cross-modal integration in MLLMs for time series remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment and entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, hindering localized interpretation and complementary reasoning.

Method: MADI features three components: (1) Patch-level Alignment for fine-grained correspondence across modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction that separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and synergizes modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting to emphasize informative, query-relevant signals.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.

Conclusion: MADI successfully addresses cross-modal integration challenges in time series understanding through its novel alignment and disentanglement mechanisms, demonstrating robust reasoning capabilities and superior performance.

Abstract: Advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have inspired time series understanding and reasoning tasks, that enable natural language querying over time series, producing textual analyses of complex temporal dynamics. Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective cross-modal integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.

*Yu Xie,Xing Kai Ren,Ying Qi,Hu Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出SAGE优化框架，通过重用原生LLM词表并引入非对称自适应动态机制，解决生成式推荐系统中的冷启动和多样性崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作如OneRec在推荐系统中验证了LLM的缩放定律，但依赖独立的词表，阻碍了原生LLM架构的复用，导致维护成本高且扩展性差；同时其GBPO优化策略存在"对称保守主义"问题，静态梯度边界抑制了冷启动项目的更新动量，且无法防止高噪声环境下的多样性崩溃。

Method: 提出SAGE（序列级自适应梯度演化）统一优化框架，包含两个核心创新：(1) 序列级信号解耦：结合几何平均重要性比率与解耦多目标优势，消除token级方差并解决"奖励崩溃"问题；(2) 非对称自适应动态：构建动态梯度流形，对高潜力冷启动项目应用"增强因子"实现超线性更新，并采用"熵感知惩罚"打破信息茧房。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，SAGE能有效释放冷启动流量并维持推荐多样性，同时保留了GBPO的数值稳定性。

Conclusion: SAGE通过创新性的优化框架，成功解决了现有方法在词表复用、冷启动和多样性方面的限制，为生成式推荐系统提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While works such as OneRec have validated the scaling laws of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems, they rely on a cumbersome separate vocabulary. This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a "Symmetric Conservatism" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the "Reward Collapse" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a "Boost Factor" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an "Entropy Aware Penalty" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出HER框架，通过双层思维机制（角色第一人称思维与LLM第三人称思维）、逆向工程构建的推理增强角色扮演数据，以及人类对齐的奖励模型，实现了认知层面的LLM角色扮演，在CoSER和Minimax Role-Play Bench基准上显著超越基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM角色扮演模型虽能捕捉角色语调与知识，但难以模拟行为背后的内在思维，主要受限于高质量推理轨迹数据的缺失和符合人类偏好的可靠奖励信号不足。

Method: HER框架引入双层思维区分角色与LLM的认知过程，通过逆向工程构建推理增强的角色扮演数据集，设计人类对齐的原则与奖励模型，并基于Qwen3-32B采用监督学习与强化学习进行训练。

Result: HER模型显著优于Qwen3-32B基线，在CoSER基准上提升30.26分，在Minimax Role-Play Bench上提升14.97分。

Conclusion: HER框架有效实现了认知级角色模拟，实验验证了其优越性，相关数据集、原则与模型将开源以促进后续研究。

Abstract: LLM role-playing, i.e., using LLMs to simulate specific personas, has emerged as a key capability in various applications, such as companionship, content creation, and digital games. While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train \method models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench. Our datasets, principles, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 提出Large Lookup Layer (L³)，一种新型稀疏层，通过静态token路由聚合上下文相关的学习嵌入，在2.6B参数模型上强于稠密模型和MoE


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏模型依赖MoE的动态硬路由，存在硬件效率低、训练不稳定需辅助损失等问题；而原生稀疏的tokenizer嵌入表缺乏上下文信息

Method: 将嵌入表推广至decoder层，使用静态token路由上下文相关地聚合多个学习嵌入；包含系统友好架构（无开销CPU卸载推理）和信息论嵌入分配算法平衡速度质量

Result: 在2.6B活跃参数量transformer上，L³在语言建模和下游任务中均显著优于稠密模型和等稀疏度MoE

Conclusion: L³开启了新的稀疏维度，通过嵌入缓存信息高效平衡内存与计算，为MoE和稠密模型提供了更优替代方案

Abstract: Modern sparse language models typically achieve sparsity through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, which dynamically route tokens to dense MLP "experts." However, dynamic hard routing has a number of drawbacks, such as potentially poor hardware efficiency and needing auxiliary losses for stable training. In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.

### [226] [Partial Feedback Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21462)
*Shihao Shao,Cong Fang,Zhouchen Lin,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper characterizes partial-feedback online learning by introducing novel complexity measures (PFLdim for deterministic learners and PMSdim for randomized learners) that precisely capture learnability and minimax regret in the set-realizable regime, revealing a sharp separation from non-realizable cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study partial-feedback online learning where multiple correct labels exist but only one is observed per round (e.g., language generation with single reference), and characterize minimax regret for deterministic and randomized learners.

Method: Introduce Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) using a new collection version space viewpoint, and Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) for randomized analysis; identify conditions for inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability.

Result: Near-complete minimax regret characterization: PFLdim precisely governs deterministic learnability; PMSdim gives tight bounds for randomized learners; finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure ensures inseparability; resolves open question on set-valued online learning; shows linear regret possible outside set realizability even for |H|=2.

Conclusion: Provides comprehensive characterization of partial-feedback online learning in set-realizable regime via new complexity measures, highlighting that set realizability is essential and fundamentally new noise-sensitive measures are needed beyond this regime.

Abstract: We study partial-feedback online learning, where each instance admits a set of correct labels, but the learner only observes one correct label per round; any prediction within the correct set is counted as correct. This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$. This highlights the need for fundamentally new, noise-sensitive complexity measures to meaningfully characterize learnability beyond set realizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有块坐标下降(BCD)理论多针对凸优化问题，对非凸优化（如稀疏精度矩阵估计）的理论研究不足，亟需通用框架解决实际大规模非凸问题

Method: 构建通用BCD框架：1) 支持变度量近端梯度/近端牛顿/交替极小化更新；2) 涵盖Graphical Lasso三大求解器(ISTA/GLasso/QUIC)；3) 证明非凸复合优化目标函数下降及收敛性

Conclusion: 该框架成功桥接理论与应用，为非凸优化提供通用收敛分析工具，显著提升大规模优化问题计算效率，特别适用于统计学习中的高维推断任务

Abstract: Block-coordinate descent (BCD) is the method of choice to solve numerous large scale optimization problems, however their theoretical study for non-convex optimization, has received less attention. In this paper, we present a new block-coordinate descent (BCD) framework to tackle non-convex composite optimization problems, ensuring decrease of the objective function and convergence to a solution. This framework is general enough to include variable metric proximal gradient updates, proximal Newton updates, and alternated minimization updates. This generality allows to encompass three versions of the most used solvers in the sparse precision matrix estimation problem, deemed Graphical Lasso: graphical ISTA, Primal GLasso, and QUIC. We demonstrate the value of this new framework on non-convex sparse precision matrix estimation problems, providing convergence guarantees and up to a $100$-fold reduction in the number of iterations required to reach state-of-the-art estimation quality.

TL;DR: 提出PPI-SVRG方法，结合预训练模型预测和参考梯度，解决标签稀缺下的半监督随机优化问题，在保持收敛稳定性的同时提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标签数据稀缺但预训练模型预测可用的场景下，研究半监督随机优化问题，利用控制变量法降低方差

Method: 证明PPI和SVRG在数学上等价，并融合两者提出PPI-SVRG算法；通过收敛性分析揭示预测不确定性对优化过程的影响边界

Result: 收敛界包含标准SVRG速率和预测不确定性的误差下限；预测质量仅影响收敛邻域大小；实验显示在均值估计基准上MSE降低43-52%，MNIST数据集（10%标签）测试准确率提升2.7-2.9个百分点

Conclusion: PPI-SVRG有效结合了预测信息与梯度信息，在标签稀缺时显著提升优化性能，且收敛行为理论分析与实验结果一致

Abstract: We study semi-supervised stochastic optimization when labeled data is scarce but predictions from pre-trained models are available. PPI and SVRG both reduce variance through control variates -- PPI uses predictions, SVRG uses reference gradients. We show they are mathematically equivalent and develop PPI-SVRG, which combines both. Our convergence bound decomposes into the standard SVRG rate plus an error floor from prediction uncertainty. The rate depends only on loss geometry; predictions affect only the neighborhood size. When predictions are perfect, we recover SVRG exactly. When predictions degrade, convergence remains stable but reaches a larger neighborhood. Experiments confirm the theory: PPI-SVRG reduces MSE by 43--52\% under label scarcity on mean estimation benchmarks and improves test accuracy by 2.7--2.9 percentage points on MNIST with only 10\% labeled data.

### [229] [Best Arm Identification with LLM Judges and Limited Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21471)
*Ruicheng Ao,Hongyu Chen,Siyang Gao,Hanwei Li,David Simchi-Levi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: For best-arm identification with biased proxies (e.g., LLM judges) and expensive selective human audits, we develop a bias-corrected estimator using inverse-propensity-weighted residuals, construct anytime-valid confidence sequences, and propose an adaptive auditing algorithm that achieves near-oracle efficiency by focusing on unreliable contexts and close arms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many real-world decision-making problems, we have access to cheap but biased proxies (like LLM-based evaluations) and can only afford expensive ground-truth labels (human audits) selectively. Classical multi-fidelity methods assume unbiased proxies and cannot handle arm- and context-dependent bias with selective observation, leading to mis-selection or inefficient resource use.

Method: We propose an estimator that integrates proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals to correct for bias. We construct anytime-valid confidence sequences for arm means based on this estimator. Using these sequences, we design an adaptive algorithm that dynamically decides which arms to audit, concentrating resources on contexts with high uncertainty and arms that are competitive for the best arm.

Result: We prove that without bias correction, mis-selection probability does not vanish even with infinite proxy data. Our algorithm with a plug-in Neyman rule achieves near-oracle audit efficiency. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate superior empirical performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of biased proxies and selective ground truth in best-arm identification, providing both strong theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency by adaptively allocating audits to where they provide maximal value.

Abstract: We study fixed-confidence best-arm identification (BAI) where a cheap but potentially biased proxy (e.g., LLM judge) is available for every sample, while an expensive ground-truth label can only be acquired selectively when using a human for auditing. Unlike classical multi-fidelity BAI, the proxy is biased (arm- and context-dependent) and ground truth is selectively observed. Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data). We then develop an estimator for the mean of each arm that combines proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and form anytime-valid confidence sequences for that estimator. Based on the estimator and confidence sequence, we propose an algorithm that adaptively selects and audits arms. The algorithm concentrates audits on unreliable contexts and close arms and we prove that a plug-in Neyman rule achieves near-oracle audit efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: A training-free inference method called ETS that samples from optimal RL policy for language models by estimating an energy term via online Monte Carlo, improving generation quality without costly RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL post-training alignment for language models is effective but suffers from high cost and instability due to complex training processes, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: The paper proposes Energy-Guided Test-Time Scaling (ETS), a training-free inference algorithm that combines a reference policy with an energy term in MLM transition probability. It estimates the energy term using online Monte Carlo with provable convergence, leveraging acceleration frameworks and tailored importance sampling to reduce latency while maintaining sampling quality.

Result: Experiments across reasoning, coding, and science benchmarks show ETS consistently improves generation quality for both autoregressive and diffusion language models, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: ETS provides an effective, efficient training-free alternative to traditional RL alignment methods, successfully improving language model outputs at inference time with theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training alignment for language models is effective, but also costly and unstable in practice, owing to its complicated training process. To address this, we propose a training-free inference method to sample directly from the optimal RL policy. The transition probability applied to Masked Language Modeling (MLM) consists of a reference policy model and an energy term. Based on this, our algorithm, Energy-Guided Test-Time Scaling (ETS), estimates the key energy term via online Monte Carlo, with a provable convergence rate. Moreover, to ensure practical efficiency, ETS leverages modern acceleration frameworks alongside tailored importance sampling estimators, substantially reducing inference latency while provably preserving sampling quality. Experiments on MLM (including autoregressive models and diffusion language models) across reasoning, coding, and science benchmarks show that our ETS consistently improves generation quality, validating its effectiveness and design.

Abstract: In many applications of LLMs, natural language responses often have an underlying structure such as representing discrete labels, numerical values, or graphs. Yet, existing decoding and uncertainty estimation methods operate only in language space and largely disregard structural information. We address this by modeling LLM outputs directly in a task-dependent latent structure. By equipping this structure with a dissimilarity measure, we can compute Bayes-optimal responses. These are not selected from sampled generations but are newly synthesized by combining individual responses in the latent space. Across different tasks, Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform standard decoding methods like beam search. Moreover, quantifying uncertainty via the induced Bayesian risk captures variations in terms of the latent structure and improves alignment with output quality and correctness. Our decision-theoretic framework is applicable to any problem that admits a latent response structure and enables reliable task-aware LLM predictions.

Abstract: Many-Task Learning refers to the setting where a large number of related tasks need to be learned, the exact relationships between tasks are not known. We introduce the Cascaded Transfer Learning, a novel many-task transfer learning paradigm where information (e.g. model parameters) cascades hierarchically through tasks that are learned by individual models of the same class, while respecting given budget constraints. The cascade is organized as a rooted tree that specifies the order in which tasks are learned and refined. We design a cascaded transfer mechanism deployed over a minimum spanning tree structure that connects the tasks according to a suitable distance measure, and allocates the available training budget along its branches. Experiments on synthetic and real many-task settings show that the resulting method enables more accurate and cost effective adaptation across large task collections compared to alternative approaches.

*Chi-Sheng Chen,En-Jui Kuo,Guan-Ying Chen,Xinyu Zhang,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper theoretically analyzes embedding choices for SPD EEG covariance matrices on Riemannian manifolds, revealing that Log-Euclidean embeddings achieve state-of-the-art Transformer performance while BWSPD offers competitive accuracy with better gradient conditioning for high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The theoretical connection between embedding geometry and optimization dynamics for SPD manifolds in EEG analysis remains unexplored, limiting understanding of how different embeddings affect model performance and numerical stability.

Method: Formal analysis linking embedding choice to gradient conditioning and numerical stability, establishing three theoretical results about BWSPD and Log-Euclidean embeddings, validated via a unified Transformer framework with 1,500+ runs across three EEG paradigms (motor imagery, ERP, SSVEP).

Result: (1) BWSPD provides √κ gradient conditioning vs κ for Log-Euclidean, beneficial for high-dimensional inputs (d≥22) but less advantageous for low-dimensional (d≤8); (2) BN-Embed yields +26% accuracy on 56-channel ERP data but negligible effect on 8-channel SSVEP data; (3) BWSPD preserves manifold distances with distortion governed by condition ratio κ; (4) Log-Euclidean Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

Conclusion: Log-Euclidean embeddings are optimal for SPD manifold-based EEG Transformers, while BWSPD provides competitive performance with theoretical gradient conditioning advantages for high-dimensional data, offering practical guidance for embedding selection based on input dimensionality and channel count.

Abstract: Spatial covariance matrices of EEG signals are Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) and lie on a Riemannian manifold, yet the theoretical connection between embedding geometry and optimization dynamics remains unexplored. We provide a formal analysis linking embedding choice to gradient conditioning and numerical stability for SPD manifolds, establishing three theoretical results: (1) BWSPD's $\sqrtκ$ gradient conditioning (vs $κ$ for Log-Euclidean) via Daleckii-Kreĭn matrices provides better gradient conditioning on high-dimensional inputs ($d \geq 22$), with this advantage reducing on low-dimensional inputs ($d \leq 8$) where eigendecomposition overhead dominates; (2) Embedding-Space Batch Normalization (BN-Embed) approximates Riemannian normalization up to $O(\varepsilon^2)$ error, yielding $+26\%$ accuracy on 56-channel ERP data but negligible effect on 8-channel SSVEP data, matching the channel-count-dependent prediction; (3) bi-Lipschitz bounds prove BWSPD tokens preserve manifold distances with distortion governed solely by the condition ratio $κ$. We validate these predictions via a unified Transformer framework comparing BWSPD, Log-Euclidean, and Euclidean embeddings within identical architecture across 1,500+ runs on three EEG paradigms (motor imagery, ERP, SSVEP; 36 subjects). Our Log-Euclidean Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, substantially outperforming classical Riemannian classifiers and recent SPD baselines, while BWSPD offers competitive accuracy with similar training time.

*Bang Giang Le,Viet Cuong Ta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a graph-based reward method in Multi-Agent RL that combines global and local rewards for fine-grained credit assignment while maintaining cooperation, outperforming traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global rewards in cooperative MARL are noisy and hard to assign credit, while local rewards cause suboptimal selfish behavior; need a method combining both benefits.

Method: Uses an agent interaction graph to discern fine-grained individual contributions from local rewards, with a practical graph approximation approach.

Result: Experiments show the method is flexible and improves performance over traditional local and global reward settings.

Conclusion: The graph-based approach effectively balances cooperation and credit assignment, providing a superior alternative to conventional MARL reward structures.

Abstract: To promote cooperation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, the reward signals of all agents can be aggregated together, forming global rewards that are commonly known as the fully cooperative setting. However, global rewards are usually noisy because they contain the contributions of all agents, which have to be resolved in the credit assignment process. On the other hand, using local reward benefits from faster learning due to the separation of agents' contributions, but can be suboptimal as agents myopically optimize their own reward while disregarding the global optimality. In this work, we propose a method that combines the merits of both approaches. By using a graph of interaction between agents, our method discerns the individual agent contribution in a more fine-grained manner than a global reward, while alleviating the cooperation problem with agents' local reward. We also introduce a practical approach for approximating such a graph. Our experiments demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, enabling improvements over the traditional local and global reward settings.

Result: 在理论和实验上均证明该方法在多模态时间序列预测任务中有显著性能提升

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态时间序列预测提供了新的有效解决方案，代码已开源

Abstract: Real-world time series exhibit complex and evolving dynamics, making accurate forecasting extremely challenging. Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current histology-based gene expression prediction models are limited to individual cancer types and use variance-based evaluation, lacking exploration of functional biological relevance and pan-cancer generalization needed for clinical impact.

Method: Developed HistoPrism, an efficient transformer-based architecture for pan-cancer gene expression prediction from H&E histology, and introduced a novel pathway-level benchmark to assess biological meaning rather than isolated gene-level variance.

Result: HistoPrism surpasses prior state-of-the-art models on highly variable genes and achieves substantial gains on pathway-level prediction, successfully recovering biologically coherent transcriptomic patterns across cancer types.

Conclusion: HistoPrism establishes a new standard for clinically relevant transcriptomic modeling from routinely available histology, providing a scalable, efficient, and biologically meaningful alternative to sequencing.

Abstract: Predicting spatial gene expression from H&E histology offers a scalable and clinically accessible alternative to sequencing, but realizing clinical impact requires models that generalize across cancer types and capture biologically coherent signals. Prior work is often limited to per-cancer settings and variance-based evaluation, leaving functional relevance underexplored. We introduce HistoPrism, an efficient transformer-based architecture for pan-cancer prediction of gene expression from histology. To evaluate biological meaning, we introduce a pathway-level benchmark, shifting assessment from isolated gene-level variance to coherent functional pathways. HistoPrism not only surpasses prior state-of-the-art models on highly variable genes , but also more importantly, achieves substantial gains on pathway-level prediction, demonstrating its ability to recover biologically coherent transcriptomic patterns. With strong pan-cancer generalization and improved efficiency, HistoPrism establishes a new standard for clinically relevant transcriptomic modeling from routinely available histology.

Conclusion: 表征遗忘是一种有前景的替代方案，通过在表征空间而非参数空间操作，有效克服了传统机器遗忘方法的局限性，在隐私保护和模型鲁棒性方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of specific training data from a model, a need driven by privacy regulations and robustness concerns. Existing approaches typically modify model parameters, but such updates can be unstable, computationally costly, and limited by local approximations. We introduce Representation Unlearning, a framework that performs unlearning directly in the model's representation space. Instead of modifying model parameters, we learn a transformation over representations that imposes an information bottleneck: maximizing mutual information with retained data while suppressing information about data to be forgotten. We derive variational surrogates that make this objective tractable and show how they can be instantiated in two practical regimes: when both retain and forget data are available, and in a zero-shot setting where only forget data can be accessed. Experiments across several benchmarks demonstrate that Representation Unlearning achieves more reliable forgetting, better utility retention, and greater computational efficiency than parameter-centric baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexCausal is a novel CDRL framework that uses block-diagonal covariance VAE and flow-based priors to learn disentangled representations by modeling complex noise distributions and integrating supervised alignment with counterfactual constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CDRL methods rely on restrictive mean-field approximations with diagonal covariance that decorrelates all latent dimensions, and assume simplistic isotropic Gaussian priors for exogenous noise, failing to capture the complex, non-Gaussian statistical properties of real-world causal factors.

Method: The authors propose FlexCausal, which employs a block-diagonal covariance VAE architecture and a Factorized Flow-based Prior to model complex noise densities. It integrates supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints to ensure structural correspondence between latent subspaces and causal relations, and uses a manifold-aware relative intervention strategy for generation.

Result: Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FlexCausal significantly outperforms existing disentanglement methods.

Conclusion: FlexCausal successfully addresses key limitations in causal disentanglement by realistically modeling noise distributions and decoupling causal mechanism learning from distributional statistics, achieving superior performance in learning disentangled representations with accurate causal structure.

Abstract: Causal Disentangled Representation Learning(CDRL) aims to learn and disentangle low dimensional representations and their underlying causal structure from observations. However, existing disentanglement methods rely on a standard mean-field approximation with a diagonal posterior covariance, which decorrelates all latent dimensions. Additionally, these methods often assume isotropic Gaussian priors for exogenous noise, failing to capture the complex, non-Gaussian statistical properties prevalent in real-world causal factors. Therefore, we propose FlexCausal, a novel CDRL framework based on a block-diagonal covariance VAE. FlexCausal utilizes a Factorized Flow-based Prior to realistically model the complex densities of exogenous noise, effectively decoupling the learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics. By integrating supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints, our framework ensures a precise structural correspondence between the learned latent subspaces and the ground-truth causal relations. Finally, we introduce a manifold-aware relative intervention strategy to ensure high-fidelity generation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FlexCausal significantly outperforms other methods.

### [239] [Shaping capabilities with token-level data filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21571)
*Neil Rathi,Alec Radford*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Filtering tokens during pretraining is a simple, effective, and scalable method to remove undesired capabilities from language models, outperforming document-level filtering and becoming more effective at larger model scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post hoc methods for reducing undesired capabilities in language models are easily bypassed by adversaries, necessitating more fundamental approaches during the pretraining phase itself.

Method: The paper proposes filtering pretraining data at the token level rather than document level, using data attribution techniques, sparse autoencoders for token labeling, and distillation of cheap classifiers to remove specific capabilities (medical knowledge as a proxy task).

Result: Token filtering achieves the same reduction in undesired capabilities at lower cost to benign ones; effectiveness increases with scale (7000x compute slowdown on forget domain for largest models); models remain alignable on the forget domain; and the approach is robust to noisy labels with sufficient compute.

Conclusion: Pretraining data filtering, particularly at the token level, provides a robust, inexpensive, and scalable solution for removing undesired capabilities that cannot be easily bypassed, offering a viable alternative to post hoc methods.

Abstract: Current approaches to reducing undesired capabilities in language models are largely post hoc, and can thus be easily bypassed by adversaries. A natural alternative is to shape capabilities during pretraining itself. On the proxy task of removing medical capabilities, we show that the simple intervention of filtering pretraining data is highly effective, robust, and inexpensive at scale. Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain. We also show that models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. Along the way, we introduce a methodology for labeling tokens with sparse autoencoders and distilling cheap, high-quality classifiers. We also demonstrate that filtering can be robust to noisy labels with sufficient pretraining compute.

Conclusion: 梯度相似性是遗忘的根本原因，CNL通过选择性更新协同神经元有效消除灾难性遗忘，为LLM持续学习提供理论基础和实践方案

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting during knowledge injection severely undermines the continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often lack a foundational theoretical explanation. We establish a gradient-based theoretical framework to explain catastrophic forgetting. We first prove that strongly negative gradient similarity is a fundamental cause of forgetting. We then use gradient similarity to identify two types of neurons: conflicting neurons that induce forgetting and account for 50%-75% of neurons, and collaborative neurons that mitigate forgetting and account for 25%-50%. Based on this analysis, we propose a knowledge injection method, Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL). By freezing conflicting neurons and updating only collaborative neurons, CNL theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting under an infinitesimal learning rate eta and an exactly known mastered set. Experiments on five LLMs, four datasets, and four optimizers show that CNL achieves zero forgetting in in-set settings and reduces forgetting by 59.1%-81.7% in out-of-set settings.

Result: BatchEnsemble matches deep ensembles' uncertainty performance and outperforms Monte Carlo dropout. GRUBE achieves comparable or superior prediction and uncertainty estimation. Both methods require fewer parameters and less training/inference time than traditional ensembles.

Conclusion: BatchEnsemble and GRUBE offer a scalable, parameter-efficient alternative to traditional ensembles for uncertainty estimation, maintaining performance while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Deep learning models struggle with uncertainty estimation. Many approaches are either computationally infeasible or underestimate uncertainty. We investigate \textit{BatchEnsemble} as a general and scalable method for uncertainty estimation across both tabular and time series tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CORDS proposes an invertible mapping that transforms variable-sized sets into continuous density and feature fields, enabling models to operate in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets, solving unknown set size prediction challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many learning problems require predicting variable-sized sets where object count is unknown beforehand (e.g., object detection, molecular modeling, astrophysical source detection). Existing methods rely on padded representations or explicit set size inference, which are problematic.

Method: CORDS casts set prediction as a continuous inference problem with an invertible mapping that converts sets into continuous fields: a density field encoding locations and count, and a feature field encoding attributes, allowing models to operate in field space while being exactly decodable.

Result: Evaluated across molecular generation/regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and mathematical tasks, CORDS demonstrates robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: CORDS provides a novel, effective strategy for variable-sized set prediction by leveraging continuous field representations with invertible mappings, overcoming limitations of traditional discrete approaches.

Abstract: Many learning problems require predicting sets of objects when the number of objects is not known beforehand. Examples include object detection, molecular modeling, and scientific inference tasks such as astrophysical source detection. Existing methods often rely on padded representations or must explicitly infer the set size, which often poses challenges. We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: FedSSA addresses feature and structural heterogeneity in Graph Federated Learning by using variational models to align node feature distributions across clusters and spectral GNNs to align structural topology characteristics, achieving superior performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Federated Learning suffers from heterogeneity in node features and structural topologies across clients, which hinders effective knowledge sharing and model performance. Existing methods don't adequately address both types of heterogeneity simultaneously.

Method: The paper proposes FedSSA, which: 1) For feature heterogeneity: Uses a variational model to infer class-wise node distributions, clusters clients, constructs cluster-level distributions, and minimizes divergence between local and cluster-level distributions; 2) For structural heterogeneity: Employs spectral GNNs with a spectral energy measure to characterize structure, clusters clients based on spectral energy, builds cluster-level spectral GNNs, and aligns their spectral characteristics.

Result: Experiments on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets under both non-overlapping and overlapping partitioning show that FedSSA consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FedSSA effectively addresses both node feature and structural heterogeneity in GFL through semantic and structural alignment, demonstrating superior performance across diverse graph datasets and partitioning settings.

Abstract: Graph Federated Learning (GFL) enables distributed graph representation learning while protecting the privacy of graph data. However, GFL suffers from heterogeneity arising from diverse node features and structural topologies across multiple clients. To address both types of heterogeneity, we propose a novel graph Federated learning method via Semantic and Structural Alignment (FedSSA), which shares the knowledge of both node features and structural topologies. For node feature heterogeneity, we propose a novel variational model to infer class-wise node distributions, so that we can cluster clients based on inferred distributions and construct cluster-level representative distributions. We then minimize the divergence between local and cluster-level distributions to facilitate semantic knowledge sharing. For structural heterogeneity, we employ spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and propose a spectral energy measure to characterize structural information, so that we can cluster clients based on spectral energy and build cluster-level spectral GNNs. We then align the spectral characteristics of local spectral GNNs with those of cluster-level spectral GNNs to enable structural knowledge sharing. Experiments on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets under both non-overlapping and overlapping partitioning settings demonstrate that FedSSA consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM分布锐化提供了计算高效、理论扎实的MCMC替代方案，在保持RL方法性能的同时大幅提升实用性

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a dominant approach for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet growing evidence suggests that its gains arise primarily from distribution sharpening rather than the acquisition of new capabilities. Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively. Empirically, we evaluate our method on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, and show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without relying on any external rewards, while reducing inference latency by over 10x compared to MCMC-based sampling.

### [245] [Dynamics Reveals Structure: Challenging the Linear Propagation Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21601)
*Hoyeon Chang,Bálint Mucsányi,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proves fundamental geometric limits of the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA) in neural networks, showing that while negation and converse operations can be preserved through tensor factorization, composition operations lead to an unavoidable obstruction because bilinearity (required for conjunction) is incompatible with negation, forcing feature collapse and explaining failures in knowledge editing and multi-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether first-order parameter updates in neural networks preserve logical coherence under the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA), which posits that local updates should coherently propagate to logical consequences, addressing underlying causes of failures in knowledge editing, the reversal curse, and multi-hop reasoning.

Method: Uses relation algebra formalism to analyze three core logical operations: negation, converse, and composition. Proves mathematical constraints on implementing these operations under LPA, examining tensor factorization requirements and bilinearity conditions through geometric analysis of feature spaces.

Result: (1) For negation and converse, direction-agnostic propagation requires tensor factorization separating entity-pair context from relation content; (2) For composition, a fundamental obstruction exists: composition reduces to conjunction which must be bilinear on linear features, but bilinearity is incompatible with negation, forcing the feature map to collapse.

Conclusion: Failures in knowledge editing, the reversal curse, and multi-hop reasoning likely stem from common structural limitations inherent to the Linear Propagation Assumption, revealing fundamental geometric constraints that prevent neural networks from maintaining logical coherence during parameter updates.

Abstract: Neural networks adapt through first-order parameter updates, yet it remains unclear whether such updates preserve logical coherence. We investigate the geometric limits of the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA), the premise that local updates coherently propagate to logical consequences. To formalize this, we adopt relation algebra and study three core operations on relations: negation flips truth values, converse swaps argument order, and composition chains relations. For negation and converse, we prove that guaranteeing direction-agnostic first-order propagation necessitates a tensor factorization separating entity-pair context from relation content. However, for composition, we identify a fundamental obstruction. We show that composition reduces to conjunction, and prove that any conjunction well-defined on linear features must be bilinear. Since bilinearity is incompatible with negation, this forces the feature map to collapse. These results suggest that failures in knowledge editing, the reversal curse, and multi-hop reasoning may stem from common structural limitations inherent to the LPA.

Method: TTReFT (Test-Time Representation FineTuning) framework that transitions adaptation from model parameters to latent representations through three innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection, (2) low-rank representation interventions to preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder with dynamic masking strategy.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks frequently exhibit significant performance degradation in the out-of-distribution test scenario. While test-time training (TTT) offers a promising solution, existing Parameter Finetuning (PaFT) paradigm suffer from catastrophic forgetting, hindering their real-world applicability. We propose TTReFT, a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework that transitions the adaptation target from model parameters to latent representations. Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme. Theoretically, we establish guarantees for TTReFT in OOD settings. Empirically, extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTReFT achieves consistent and superior performance. Our work establishes representation finetuning as a new paradigm for graph TTT, offering both theoretical grounding and immediate practical utility for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出"过度扩展诅咒"问题：在LLM并行推理中，统一使用高并行度N会导致简单样本资源浪费。设计T2方法通过潜在表示预估各样本最优并行度，实现成本显著降低且性能保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统级并行推理采用全局固定并行度N，忽略样本异质性，导致简单样本产生预算冗余，系统级效率与样本级效能存在根本冲突。

Method: 1) 形式化定义并量化过度扩展诅咒；2) 揭示其普适性与触发机制；3) 提出轻量级方法T2，利用解码前潜在表示动态预估各样本最优并行度N'。

Result: T2在保持模型性能接近全局并行基线的同时，显著降低计算成本，实现更高效的并行推理资源分配。

Conclusion: 过度扩展诅咒是LLM并行推理中的关键效率瓶颈，T2通过样本自适应并行度分配有效打破该诅咒，为资源敏感场景提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Parallel thinking enhances LLM reasoning by multi-path sampling and aggregation. In system-level evaluations, a global parallelism level N is allocated to all samples, typically set large to maximize overall dataset accuracy. However, due to sample heterogeneity, some samples can achieve comparable performance with a smaller N'< N, causing budget redundancy. This incompatibility between system-level efficacy and sample-level efficiency constitutes the overscaling curse. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the overscaling curse, showing its universality and severity in practice, and analyze its trigger mechanism. We then propose a lightweight method, T2, to break the overscaling curse, which utilizes latent representations to estimate the optimal parallelism level for each sample before decoding. Experiments show that T2 significantly reduces cost while maintaining comparable performance, enabling more efficient parallel thinking.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应混合精度策略，通过分析复合函数的舍入误差，选择性地对transformer推理中的小部分组件使用高精度计算，而其余部分使用低精度计算，从而在GPT-2模型上实现高达两个数量级的精度提升。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI发展，混合精度计算成为提升大语言模型效率的关键，但复合函数的浮点计算误差问题尚未得到充分解决，特别是在transformer推理中需要平衡效率与精度。

Method: 基于对复合函数f(g(x))的舍入误差分析，提出自适应策略，选择g(x)的小部分组件进行高精度计算，其余部分使用低精度。将该策略应用于transformer的不同复合结构，并在GPT-2模型上进行数值实验。

Result: 研究表明，极低的重新计算率（即仅对少量组件使用高精度）就能使transformer推理的精度提升高达两个数量级。

Conclusion: 该自适应混合精度策略能有效提升transformer推理的数值稳定性，为高效部署大语言模型提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Mixed-precision computations are a hallmark of the current stage of AI, driving the progress in large language models towards efficient, locally deployable solutions. This article addresses the floating-point computation of compositionally-rich functions, concentrating on transformer inference. Based on the rounding error analysis of a composition $f(g(\mathrm{x}))$, we provide an adaptive strategy that selects a small subset of components of $g(\mathrm{x})$ to be computed more accurately while all other computations can be carried out with lower accuracy. We then explain how this strategy can be applied to different compositions within a transformer and illustrate its overall effect on transformer inference. We study the effectiveness of this algorithm numerically on GPT-2 models and demonstrate that already very low recomputation rates allow for improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in accuracy.

*Vasileios Sevetlidis,George Pavlidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This survey addresses the non-memoryless nature of modern deep-learning training by systematically organizing memory mechanisms and introducing causal estimation frameworks, portable perturbation primitives, and audit artifacts to measure training history effects across different settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern deep-learning training exhibits complex dependencies beyond simple optimization, including optimizer states, data ordering policies, non-convex optimization paths, and auxiliary states like EMA and BatchNorm. These memory effects make it difficult to reproduce, compare, and understand training dynamics across different models and regimes.

Method: The paper organizes memory mechanisms by their source, lifetime, and visibility. It develops seed-paired, function-space causal estimands to quantify training history effects, and introduces portable perturbation primitives (carry/reset operations for momentum/Adam/EMA/BN, data-order window swaps, queue/teacher modifications) to systematically probe these dependencies.

Result: The survey produces a comprehensive reporting checklist with audit artifacts including order hashes, buffer/BN checksums, and RNG contracts. These tools enable systematic tracking and verification of training state dependencies across different experimental configurations.

Conclusion: The authors propose a standardized protocol for portable, causal, and uncertainty-aware measurement that can attribute the influence of training history across models, datasets, and training regimes, enabling more rigorous and reproducible deep learning research.

Abstract: Modern deep-learning training is not memoryless. Updates depend on optimizer moments and averaging, data-order policies (random reshuffling vs with-replacement, staged augmentations and replay), the nonconvex path, and auxiliary state (teacher EMA/SWA, contrastive queues, BatchNorm statistics). This survey organizes mechanisms by source, lifetime, and visibility. It introduces seed-paired, function-space causal estimands; portable perturbation primitives (carry/reset of momentum/Adam/EMA/BN, order-window swaps, queue/teacher tweaks); and a reporting checklist with audit artifacts (order hashes, buffer/BN checksums, RNG contracts). The conclusion is a protocol for portable, causal, uncertainty-aware measurement that attributes how much training history matters across models, data, and regimes.

*Jan Schuchardt,Nikita Kalinin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文针对矩阵分解差分隐私训练中的隐私放大问题，提出了无需采样的Rényi散度与条件组合边界方法，通过动态规划高效计算，避免了先前蒙特卡洛方法的概率性保证和样本量依赖δ的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于采样的隐私放大方法（Choquette-Choo等，2025）存在局限：仅提供高概率保证、需要随机弃权机制，且所需样本量与δ成反比。这限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性和效率。

Method: 开发采样自由的隐私边界：1）基于Rényi散度的动态规划框架，实现高效精确计算；2）条件组合技术补充小ε场景下的更强保证。两者结合处理任意带状/非带状矩阵。

Result: 新方法消除了对随机采样的依赖，提供更紧致的隐私保证，特别是当隐私参数ε较小时。数值实验验证了其在广泛矩阵机制中的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架为差分隐私矩阵分解提供了更可靠、更高效的隐私放大分析工具，适用于研究和实践中的各种矩阵机制，显著提升了隐私-效用权衡。

Abstract: We study privacy amplification for differentially private model training with matrix factorization under random allocation (also known as the balls-in-bins model). Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(ε,δ)$-DP is inversely proportional to $δ$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation. Our framework applies to arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a broad range of matrix mechanisms used in research and practice.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Seg-MoE，一种稀疏混合专家架构，通过路由连续时间步段而非单个标记来进行时间序列预测，利用时间局部性实现了最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的模型在时间序列预测中取得显著进展，但在高效扩展和捕捉长期时间动态方面仍存在困难。现有MoE方法采用标记级路由，未能充分利用时间数据的内在局部性和连续性。

Method: 作者提出Seg-MoE，将连续时间步段作为路由和处理的单位，而非逐标记独立决策。这种方式使每个专家能直接建模段内交互，自然契合时间模式。将Seg-MoE层集成到时间序列Transformer中。

Result: 在多变量长期预测基准测试中，Seg-MoE在几乎所有预测时域上持续实现最先进预测精度，优于密集Transformer和先前标记级MoE模型。消融研究证实段级路由是关键因素。

Conclusion: 研究表明，使MoE路由粒度与时间序列内在结构对齐提供了强大的归纳偏置，为序列数据建模中的条件稀疏架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently made significant advances in accurate time-series forecasting, but even these architectures struggle to scale efficiently while capturing long-term temporal dynamics. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains. Our results show that aligning the MoE routing granularity with the inherent structure of time series provides a powerful, yet previously underexplored, inductive bias, opening new avenues for conditionally sparse architectures in sequential data modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私敏感和资源受限环境需要强大的开放权重小语言模型，但现有任务中心学习(TCL)范式无法解决模型在复杂陌生代码库上的推理时泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出仓库中心学习(RCL)范式，通过四个单元的仓库中心经验将静态代码库转化为交互式学习信号，训练仓库专业化专家模型，使模型通过参数化知识获取内化目标软件环境的"物理规律"。

Result: SWE-Spot-4B系列模型在多个SWE任务上超越Meta的CWM、Qwen3-Coder-30B等更大规模开放权重模型，并匹敌或超越GPT-4.1-mini、GPT-5-nano等商业模型，同时实现更高的训练样本效率和更低的推理成本。

Conclusion: 仓库掌握度是构建高效智能体的独特且必要维度，补充通用编码能力，强调深度代码库内化优于广度任务覆盖。

Abstract: The deployment of coding agents in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments drives the demand for capable open-weight Small Language Models (SLMs). However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the "physics" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabClustPFN is a prior-fitted network that performs amortized Bayesian inference for tabular data clustering, handling heterogeneous features and variable cluster numbers in a single forward pass without retraining or hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering tabular data is challenging due to heterogeneous features and diverse data mechanisms. While prior-fitted networks (PFNs) excel in supervised tabular learning, extending them to unsupervised clustering is difficult because clustering requires inferring cluster assignments, cardinality, and handling permutation-invariant outputs.

Method: The authors propose TabClustPFN, which amortizes Bayesian inference over both cluster assignments and number of clusters. Pretrained on synthetic data from a flexible clustering prior, it processes unseen datasets in one forward pass, naturally handles mixed numerical/categorical features, and adapts to various clustering structures.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world tabular benchmarks demonstrate that TabClustPFN outperforms classical, deep, and amortized clustering baselines while showing strong robustness in out-of-the-box exploratory settings.

Conclusion: TabClustPFN successfully extends the PFN paradigm to unsupervised clustering, providing a robust, general-purpose solution for tabular data clustering that requires no dataset-specific tuning.

Abstract: Clustering tabular data is a fundamental yet challenging problem due to heterogeneous feature types, diverse data-generating mechanisms, and the absence of transferable inductive biases across datasets. Prior-fitted networks (PFNs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization in supervised tabular learning by amortizing Bayesian inference under a broad synthetic prior. Extending this paradigm to clustering is nontrivial: clustering is unsupervised, admits a combinatorial and permutation-invariant output space, and requires inferring the number of clusters. We introduce TabClustPFN, a prior-fitted network for tabular data clustering that performs amortized Bayesian inference over both cluster assignments and cluster cardinality. Pretrained on synthetic datasets drawn from a flexible clustering prior, TabClustPFN clusters unseen datasets in a single forward pass, without dataset-specific retraining or hyperparameter tuning. The model naturally handles heterogeneous numerical and categorical features and adapts to a wide range of clustering structures. Experiments on synthetic data and curated real-world tabular benchmarks show that TabClustPFN outperforms classical, deep, and amortized clustering baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness in out-of-the-box exploratory settings.

### [254] [Expected Return Causes Outcome-Level Mode Collapse in Reinforcement Learning and How to Fix It with Inverse Probability Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21669)
*Abhijeet Sinha,Sundari Elango,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies that mode collapse in reinforcement learning is an inherent flaw of the expected-return objective, not just insufficient exploration. It proposes Inverse Probability Scaling (IPS) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fix this structural issue, demonstrating reduced collapse while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL expected return maximization causes policies to collapse onto a small subset of high-quality outcomes even with ideal exploration, which is a structural problem with the objective itself rather than a limitation of exploration strategies.

Method: Theoretical analysis shows log-probability ratio between outcomes evolves linearly with reward difference, causing exponential divergence. Proposes inverse probability scaling to remove outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, implemented as IPS-GRPO requiring no auxiliary models.

Result: IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance across reasoning and molecular generation tasks, validating that objective correction is more effective than adding exploration heuristics.

Conclusion: Correcting the fundamental RL objective (rather than adding exploration heuristics) is essential for reliable multimodal policy optimization, as mode collapse is an inherent structural pathology of the expected-return objective that can be fixed with minimal modifications.

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning (RL) problems admit multiple terminal solutions of comparable quality, where the goal is not to identify a single optimum but to represent a diverse set of high-quality outcomes. Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes LLM4Fluid, a framework that uses large language models as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy without retraining through physics-informed latent space compression and modality alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for spatio-temporal fluid dynamics modeling suffer from poor generalization and require retraining for new flow conditions, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: The framework compresses high-dimensional flow fields into latent space using reduced-order modeling with physics-informed disentanglement, then uses a pretrained LLM as a temporal processor for autoregressive prediction, with a modality alignment strategy to bridge representational gaps.

Result: LLM4Fluid demonstrates robust zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities across diverse flow scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy without retraining.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as powerful generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics, offering a promising paradigm that overcomes the generalization limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for spatio-temporal modeling of fluid dynamics. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XFactors is a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles specific factors of variation using contrastive supervision (InfoNCE loss) and KL regularization, avoiding unstable adversarial training while achieving state-of-the-art disentanglement on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purely unsupervised disentanglement methods fail on real data, while supervised approaches using adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers are unstable and don't scale well to large attribute sets.

Method: The method decomposes representations into factor-specific subspaces (T₁...Tₖ) and a residual subspace (S) using the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective. It employs contrastive InfoNCE loss to align target factors with their subspaces and KL regularization to impose Gaussian structure, avoiding adversarial training.

Result: Across multiple datasets with constant hyperparameters, XFactors achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores, demonstrates consistent qualitative factor alignment, enables controlled factor swapping via latent replacement, and scales effectively with increased latent capacity on real-world CelebA data.

Conclusion: XFactors provides a stable, scalable weakly-supervised solution for disentangling chosen factors without adversarial training, successfully addressing key limitations of prior approaches while maintaining explicit control over semantic factors.

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to map independent factors of variation to independent representation components. On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers.
  We introduce \textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over a chosen set of factors. Building on the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective, we decompose the representation into a residual subspace $\mathcal{S}$ and factor-specific subspaces $\mathcal{T}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{T}_K$ and a residual subspace $\mathcal{S}$. Each target factor is encoded in its assigned $\mathcal{T}_i$ through contrastive supervision: an InfoNCE loss pulls together latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatched pairs. In parallel, KL regularization imposes a Gaussian structure on both $\mathcal{S}$ and the aggregated factor subspaces, organizing the geometry without additional supervision for non-targeted factors and avoiding adversarial training and classifiers.
  Across multiple datasets, with constant hyperparameters, \textsc{XFactors} achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores and yields consistent qualitative factor alignment in the corresponding subspaces, enabling controlled factor swapping via latent replacement. We further demonstrate that our method scales correctly with increasing latent capacity and evaluate it on the real-world dataset CelebA. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/ICML26-anon/XFactors}{github.com/ICML26-anon/XFactors}.

Conclusion: 通过ResNet/ViT在28个视觉分类任务上数千次实验验证，理论预测超参数对合并模型泛化的影响成立，为模型合并提供理论基础和实践指导

Abstract: Model merging efficiently aggregates capabilities from multiple fine-tuned models into a single one, operating purely in parameter space without original data or expensive re-computation. Despite empirical successes, a unified theory for its effectiveness under heterogeneous finetuning hyperparameters (e.g., varying learning rates, batch sizes) remains missing. Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models makes it difficult to predict merged-model performance, leaving practitioners without guidance on how to fine-tune merge-friendly experts. To address those two challenges, we employ $L_2$-Stability theory under heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to analyze the generalization of the merged model $\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$. This pioneering analysis yields two key contributions: (i) \textit{A unified theoretical framework} is provided to explain existing merging algorithms, revealing how they optimize specific terms in our bound, thus offering a strong theoretical foundation for empirical observations. (ii) \textit{Actionable recommendations} are proposed for practitioners to strategically fine-tune expert models, enabling the construction of merge-friendly models within the pretraining-to-finetuning pipeline. Extensive experiments on the ResNet/Vit family across 20/8 visual classification tasks, involving thousands of finetuning models, robustly confirm the impact of different hyperparameters on the generalization of $\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$ predicted by our theoretical results.

TL;DR: 课程学习主要通过稳定模型在固定学习阶段的优化过程来提升效果，而非创造新的学习阶段；小模型受益更明显，大模型中课程学习优势减弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究课程学习(pre-training数据排序策略)是真正改变了模型的学习轨迹，还是仅重新排列了在固定轨迹上的数据暴露顺序。

Method: 使用Pythia模型(14M-410M参数)进行300B token训练，对比三种语言学驱动的课程(Age-of-Acquisition、词频、动词变化)与随机排序；在1B参数规模下对比随机与动词变化课程。

Result: 所有排序方式共享相同的潜在学习阶段序列；课程主要改变阶段内的数据暴露。小模型(≤160M)随机排序时梯度噪声更高、后期输出层谱饱和更强、最终准确率更低；课程在同等计算量下减轻这些效应。大模型中饱和差异缩小，课程增益减弱。

Conclusion: 课程学习通过稳定阶段内优化过程(而非创建新阶段)来提升效果，其机制与难度节奏和梯度方差控制相关；实际应用中小模型受益更显著。

Abstract: Curriculum learning changes the order of pre-training data, but it remains unclear whether it changes the learning trajectory or mainly reorders exposure over a fixed trajectory. We train Pythia models (14M-410M parameters) for 300B tokens under three linguistically motivated curricula-Age-of-Acquisition, word frequency, and Verb Variation (VV)-and compare each against Random ordering; at 1B parameters we compare Random and VV. Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute. At larger scales, saturation differences are smaller and curriculum gains shrink. We formalize the link between difficulty pacing and optimization stability in an idealized analysis based on gradient-variance control, and our results point to a practical takeaway: curricula help by stabilizing within-phase optimization rather than by creating new phases.

Conclusion: 这一现象具有双重性：若被滥用可能成为隐藏风险，也可成为开发具有更强能力和可控行为模型的宝贵机制。研究结果表明遗忘的意义远超单纯的信息删除。

Abstract: We consider representation misdirection (RM), a class of LLM unlearning methods that achieves forgetting by manipulating the forget-representations, that is, latent representations of forget samples. Despite being important, the roles of target vectors used in RM, however, remain underexplored. Here, we approach and revisit RM through the lens of the linear representation hypothesis. Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability). Our findings reveal that this fairly attractive phenomenon could be either a hidden risk if misused or a mechanism that can be harnessed for developing models that require stronger capabilities and controllable behaviors.

*Nan Lin,Yanbo Wang,Jacco Heres,Peter Palensky,Pedro P. Vergara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified flow matching model that handles multiple smart meter data generative tasks (imputation, super-resolution) with a single training process, outperforming task-specific baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart meter data is essential for distribution network operations but faces limitations from privacy regulations, sensor/transmission failures, and insufficient resolution. Current ML solutions require separate models for each generative task, causing redundancy and inefficiency.

Method: The authors trained a conditional flow matching model on high-dimensional 15-min resolution monthly smart meter data, treating different generative tasks as partial observations injected during the generation process.

Result: The unified model successfully performs imputation and super-resolution without re-training, generating data consistent with observations that outperforms interpolation and task-specific ML baselines.

Conclusion: Flow matching enables efficient multi-task generative modeling for smart meter data, eliminating the need for separate models and improving performance across diverse data generation tasks.

Abstract: Smart meter data is the foundation for planning and operating the distribution network. Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.

TL;DR: 论文从理论上解释了预测性逆动力学模型(PIDM)为何比行为克隆(BC)样本效率更高：通过状态预测引入偏差但大幅降低方差，实验表明BC需要3-5倍数据才能达到相当性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆(BC)在专家演示有限时易失败，尽管预测性逆动力学模型(PIDM)在实践中表现更优，但其优势背后的理论机制尚不清晰。

Method: 提出偏差-方差权衡理论框架，分析PIDM中未来状态预测与逆动力学模型的结合机制，并推导PIDM优于BC的理论条件，最后在2D导航和3D视频游戏环境中进行实证验证。

Result: 理论证明了PIDM在状态预测偏差满足特定条件时可降低预测误差并提升样本效率；2D导航任务中BC平均需3倍数据，3D游戏环境中BC需超过66%更多样本才能达到同等性能。

Conclusion: PIDM通过引入可控的预测偏差来显著降低方差，从而在样本效率上大幅超越BC，且该优势随可用数据源增加而进一步扩大。

Abstract: Behavior cloning (BC) is a practical offline imitation learning method, but it often fails when expert demonstrations are limited. Recent works have introduced a class of architectures named predictive inverse dynamics models (PIDM) that combine a future state predictor with an inverse dynamics model (IDM). While PIDM often outperforms BC, the reasons behind its benefits remain unclear. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation: PIDM introduces a bias-variance tradeoff. While predicting the future state introduces bias, conditioning the IDM on the prediction can significantly reduce variance. We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\% more samples than PIDM.

### [262] [LoRA and Privacy: When Random Projections Help (and When They Don't)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21719)
*Yaxi Hu,Johanna Düngler,Bernhard Schölkopf,Amartya Sanyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the Wishart projection mechanism for differential privacy, showing it provides DP guarantees for vector queries without additive noise but fails for matrix queries (including LoRA) where near-perfect membership inference attacks succeed. Adding noise yields stronger privacy guarantees than standard additive noise alone, and low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether structured randomness alone (Wishart projection) can provide differential privacy guarantees and analyze its implications for low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA in machine learning.

Method: Study the randomized map S ↦ Mf(S) where M follows a Wishart distribution. Analyze DP properties for vector/matrix-valued queries, demonstrate membership inference attacks, examine a noisy variant, and connect the mechanism to LoRA-style updates.

Result: Vector queries: Non-asymptotic DP without additive noise. Matrix queries: Not DP in noise-free setting (AUC > 0.99 membership inference attack). Noisy variant: Privacy amplification in both large/small rank regimes, stronger guarantees than additive noise alone. LoRA: Not inherently private, but low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at same noise level. Experiments: Tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy.

Conclusion: Wishart randomness alone suffices for DP on vector queries but not matrix queries. The noisy Wishart mechanism provides enhanced privacy guarantees, and low-rank fine-tuning offers privacy advantages over full fine-tuning, though LoRA's built-in randomness doesn't guarantee privacy by itself.

Abstract: We introduce the (Wishart) projection mechanism, a randomized map of the form $S \mapsto M f(S)$ with $M \sim W_d(1/r I_d, r)$ and study its differential privacy properties. For vector-valued queries $f$, we prove non-asymptotic DP guarantees without any additive noise, showing that Wishart randomness alone can suffice. For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CIM加速器因位宽限制导致量化支持不足，现有编译器不支持8位以下量化，造成计算周期长、权重存储效率低的问题。

Method: 采用强化学习策略在混合精度训练和编译框架中搜索最优量化配置，平衡延迟与精度。

Result: 相比现有最优方案获得2.48倍加速比，精度损失仅0.086%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了CIM架构的量化挑战，在保持高精度的同时显著提升ML工作负载的加速性能。

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) accelerators are a promising solution for accelerating Machine Learning (ML) workloads, as they perform Matrix-Vector Multiplications (MVMs) on crossbar arrays directly in memory. Although the bit widths of the crossbar inputs and cells are very limited, most CIM compilers do not support quantization below 8 bit. As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters. This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations that balance latency and accuracy. In the best case, our approach achieves up to a 2.48x speedup over existing state-of-the-art solutions, with an accuracy loss of only 0.086 %.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了Adam优化器中β₁=β₂能提升性能的根本原因：此条件使Adam具备一阶梯度尺度不变性，为设计未来优化器提供了新原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Adam在大规模训练中应用广泛，但实证发现当动量参数满足β₁=β₂时，验证分数和训练行为会改善，而此前缺乏理论解释。

Method: 提出"梯度尺度不变性"结构性质，通过理论证明Adam实现一阶梯度尺度不变性当且仅当β₁=β₂，并在视觉和语言任务中跨架构验证梯度重缩放对更新的平滑影响。

Result: 严格证明β₁=β₂是Adam获得一阶梯度尺度不变性的充要条件，实验证实该条件下梯度重缩放对更新的影响更平滑。

Conclusion: 首次从尺度不变性角度解释Adam的β₁=β₂现象，为构建更鲁棒的优化器提供了统一理论框架和设计原则。

Abstract: Adam has been at the core of large-scale training for almost a decade, yet a simple empirical fact remains unaccounted for: both validation scores and the qualitative behaviour of the training runs improve when the momentum parameters satisfy $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Some recent studies have reported this pattern, but there is still no explanation for why this choice helps. We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $β_{1}=β_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Overall, our results offer a coherent explanation for an open question in the behavior of Adam and provide a simple principle that helps guide the design of future optimizers.

TL;DR: A relational ML framework using propositionalisation of EMR temporal data with a naive Bayes classifier provides highly interpretable sepsis prediction with fourfold interpretation types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for sepsis prediction lack interpretability and ignore latent patient sub-phenotypes despite good performance.

Method: Temporal EMR data is represented in a relational schema, propositionalised via aggregation/selection functions to flatten into interpretable features, then classified with a selective naive Bayesian classifier.

Result: The approach is experimentally validated as relevant and extremely interpretable, offering four interpretation types: univariate, global, local, and counterfactual.

Conclusion: The relational approach successfully addresses interpretability limitations in sepsis prediction, providing comprehensive interpretability while maintaining relevance.

Abstract: Sepsis remains one of the most complex and heterogeneous syndromes in intensive care, characterized by diverse physiological trajectories and variable responses to treatment. While deep learning models perform well in the early prediction of sepsis, they often lack interpretability and ignore latent patient sub-phenotypes. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework by opening up a new avenue for addressing this issue: a relational approach. Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to "flatten" the data. Finally, the flattened data is classified using a selective naive Bayesian classifier. Experimental validation demonstrates the relevance of the suggested approach as well as its extreme interpretability. The interpretation is fourfold: univariate, global, local, and counterfactual.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce ECSEL, an explainable classification method that learns formal expressions in the form of signomial equations, motivated by the observation that many symbolic regression benchmarks admit compact signomial structure. ECSEL directly constructs a structural, closed-form expression that serves as both a classifier and an explanation. On standard symbolic regression benchmarks, our method recovers a larger fraction of target equations than competing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring substantially less computation. Leveraging this efficiency, ECSEL achieves classification accuracy competitive with established machine learning models without sacrificing interpretability. Further, we show that ECSEL satisfies some desirable properties regarding global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local feature attributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies i.e., e-commerce and fraud detection, demonstrate that the learned equations expose dataset biases, support counterfactual reasoning, and yield actionable insights.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 6.44% in F1 score, achieves 1.7x higher inference throughput with low memory usage, demonstrates superior few-shot learning, and implements an online system with 261.87 Mb/s throughput.

Conclusion: As the first framework adapting Mamba to network traffic classification, NetMamba+ opens new possibilities for efficient and accurate traffic analysis in complex network environments.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of encrypted network traffic, effective traffic classification has become essential for network security and quality of service management. Current machine learning and deep learning approaches for traffic classification face three critical challenges: computational inefficiency of Transformer architectures, inadequate traffic representations with loss of crucial byte-level features while retaining detrimental biases, and poor handling of long-tail distributions in real-world data. We propose NetMamba+, a framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) an efficient architecture considering Mamba and Flash Attention mechanisms, (2) a multimodal traffic representation scheme that preserves essential traffic information while eliminating biases, and (3) a label distribution-aware fine-tuning strategy. Evaluation experiments on massive datasets encompassing four main classification tasks showcase NetMamba+'s superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 6.44\% in F1 score. Moreover, NetMamba+ demonstrates excellent efficiency, achieving 1.7x higher inference throughput than the best baseline while maintaining comparably low memory usage. Furthermore, NetMamba+ exhibits superior few-shot learning abilities, achieving better classification performance with fewer labeled data. Additionally, we implement an online traffic classification system that demonstrates robust real-world performance with a throughput of 261.87 Mb/s. As the first framework to adapt Mamba architecture for network traffic classification, NetMamba+ opens new possibilities for efficient and accurate traffic analysis in complex network environments.

Result: 在MLLMU和CLEAR基准上实现稳定的遗忘-保留平衡，计算效率显著优于梯度-based和LoRA-based方法

Conclusion: KVW为LVLMs提供高效轻量的遗忘方案，在隐私保护与内容安全领域具备实用价值

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are widely adopted for their strong multimodal capabilities, yet they raise serious concerns such as privacy leakage and harmful content generation. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for removing the influence of specific data from trained models. However, existing approaches largely rely on gradient-based optimization, incurring substantial computational costs for large-scale LVLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Knowledge Vector Weakening (KVW), a training-free unlearning method that directly intervenes in the full model without gradient computation. KVW identifies knowledge vectors that are activated during the model's output generation on the forget set and progressively weakens their contributions, thereby preventing the model from exploiting undesirable knowledge. Experiments on the MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that KVW achieves a stable forget-retain trade-off while significantly improving computational efficiency over gradient-based and LoRA-based unlearning methods.

TL;DR: LORAUTER is a novel routing framework that selects LoRA adapters using task-level embeddings instead of direct query-adapter mapping, achieving superior performance and scalability for large language model adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapidly growing public pool of LoRA adapters for diverse tasks creates a need for efficient routing mechanisms, but existing query-to-adapter approaches don't scale well and require adapter training data.

Method: LORAUTER routes queries via task embeddings derived from small validation sets, operating at the task level rather than adapter level, eliminating the need for adapter training data.

Result: Outperforms baselines consistently, matches Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist, achieves SOTA on unseen tasks (+5.2 points), and scales robustly to 1500+ noisy adapters.

Conclusion: Task-level routing is a more effective and scalable approach for LoRA adapter composition, making LORAUTER a practical solution for real-world large-scale adapter ecosystems.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter efficient specialization of large language models (LLMs) through modular adapters, resulting in rapidly growing public adapter pools spanning diverse tasks. Effectively using these adapters requires routing: selecting and composing the appropriate adapters for a query. We introduce LORAUTER, a novel routing framework that selects and composes LoRA adapters using task representations rather than adapter characteristics. Unlike existing approaches that map queries directly to adapters, LORAUTER routes queries via task embeddings derived from small validation sets and does not require adapter training data. By operating at the task level, LORAUTER achieves efficient routing that scales with the number of tasks rather than the number of adapters. Experiments across multiple tasks show that LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing approaches, matching Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist and achieving state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points). We further demonstrate the robustness of LORAUTER to very large, noisy adapter pools by scaling it to over 1500 adapters.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) from human preference data is crucial for obtaining LLM leaderboards. However, many existing approaches either rely on restrictive parametric assumptions or lack valid uncertainty quantification when flexible machine learning methods are used. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric statistical framework, DMLEval, for comparing and ranking LLMs from preference data using debiased machine learning (DML). For this, we introduce generalized average ranking scores (GARS), which generalize commonly used ranking models, including the Bradley-Terry model or PageRank/ Rank centrality, with complex human responses such as ties. DMLEval comes with the following advantages: (i) It produces statistically efficient estimates of GARS ranking scores. (ii) It naturally allows the incorporation of black-box machine learning methods for estimation. (iii) It can be combined with pre-trained LLM evaluators (e.g., using LLM-as-a-judge). (iv) It suggests optimal policies for collecting preference data under budget constraints. We demonstrate these advantages both theoretically and empirically using both synthetic and real-world preference datasets. In summary, our framework provides practitioners with powerful, state-of-the-art methods for comparing or ranking LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出DASH框架解决LLM训练中确定性注意力机制的性能瓶颈，通过DAG建模和两种调度策略将FlashAttention-3后向传播吞吐量提升最高1.28倍，缩小与不确定性实现的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型训练中确定性对于可复现性至关重要，但FlashAttention-3等主流注意力实现中，确定性后向传播相比非确定性版本会导致高达37.9%的吞吐量下降，主要因梯度累积操作必须串行化以保证数值一致性，造成硬件利用率低下。

Method: 将确定性注意力后向传播建模为有向无环图(DAG)调度问题，提出DASH框架包含两种互补策略：1)降序Q-Tile迭代：反转查询块遍历顺序，减少因果注意力流水线停顿；2)移位调度：在DAG模型内理论最优的调度方案，适用于全掩码和因果掩码。

Result: 在NVIDIA H800 GPU上实证评估显示，DASH策略相比基线将注意力后向传播吞吐量提升最高1.28倍，显著缩小了确定性注意力与不确定性版本的性能差距。

Conclusion: DASH通过优化计算与梯度规约阶段的调度，有效缓解了确定性注意力机制的性能损失，为可复现的大语言模型训练提供了高效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.
  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.
  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

Abstract: Machine learning models are widely regarded as a way forward to tackle multi-query challenges that arise once expensive black-box simulations such as computational fluid dynamics are investigated. However, ensuring the desired level of accuracy for a certain task at minimal computational cost, e.g. as few black-box samples as possible, remains a challenges. Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions. Different specific forms of the above-mentioned approach are introduced and compared to each other as well as only scalar-valued based infill. Results are presented for the NASA common research model for an uncertainty propagation task showcasing high level of accuracy at significantly smaller cost compared to an approach without active learning.

Abstract: Meta reinforcement learning (RL) allows agents to leverage experience across a distribution of tasks on which the agent can train at will, enabling faster learning of optimal policies on new test tasks. Despite its success in improving sample complexity on test tasks, many real-world applications, such as robotics and healthcare, impose safety constraints during testing. Constrained meta RL provides a promising framework for integrating safety into meta RL. An open question in constrained meta RL is how to ensure the safety of the policy on the real-world test task, while reducing the sample complexity and thus, enabling faster learning of optimal policies. To address this gap, we propose an algorithm that refines policies learned during training, with provable safety and sample complexity guarantees for learning a near optimal policy on the test tasks. We further derive a matching lower bound, showing that this sample complexity is tight.

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) is an emerging avenue within Optimization community, where algorithm design policy could be meta-learned by reinforcement learning to enhance optimization performance. So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO.

*Sidney Bender,Marco Morik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE)框架，通过将冻结的基础模型与解耦字典学习相结合，实现无需梯度的高效反事实生成。该方法能生成多样化且解耦的反事实样本，在缓解虚假相关性方面达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基础模型具备强大的零样本能力，但仍易受虚假相关性和"Clever Hans"策略影响。现有缓解方法存在两大局限：依赖不可获得的群体标签，或需要计算昂贵的基于梯度的对抗优化。

Method: 提出视觉解耦扩散自编码器(DiDAE)，通过解耦字典学习在可解释的解耦方向上编辑基础模型的嵌入表示，再利用扩散自编码器进行解码，实现梯度无关的反事实生成。

Result: DiDAE能为每个事实样本生成多个多样化、解耦的反事实样本，速度远超现有基线方法(后者仅生成单一纠缠反事实)。与反事实知识蒸馏(CFKD)结合后，在缓解捷径学习方面达到SOTA性能，并显著提升不平衡数据集上的下游任务表现。

Conclusion: DiDAE提供了一种高效、无梯度的反事实生成方案，能有效缓解基础模型中的虚假相关性，为提高模型在不平衡数据集上的鲁棒性和性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models, despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, remain vulnerable to spurious correlations and 'Clever Hans' strategies. Existing mitigation methods often rely on unavailable group labels or computationally expensive gradient-based adversarial optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE), a novel framework integrating frozen foundation models with disentangled dictionary learning for efficient, gradient-free counterfactual generation directly for the foundation model. DiDAE first edits foundation model embeddings in interpretable disentangled directions of the disentangled dictionary and then decodes them via a diffusion autoencoder. This allows the generation of multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual, much faster than existing baselines, which generate single entangled counterfactuals. When paired with Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation, DiDAE-CFKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating shortcut learning, improving downstream performance on unbalanced datasets.

*Evandro S. Ortigossa,Guy Lutsker,Eran Segal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoHETS is an encoder-only Transformer with heterogeneous expert networks (depthwise-convolution and Fourier-based) for multivariate time series forecasting, achieving 12% MSE reduction over SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multivariate time series have complex multi-scale structures (global trends, local periodicities, non-stationary regimes) that are challenging for long-horizon forecasting, and existing sparse MoE methods using homogeneous MLP experts fail to capture diverse temporal dynamics.

Method: Proposes MoHETS with sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers combining shared depthwise-convolution experts and routed Fourier-based experts, cross-attention for exogenous information, and a lightweight convolutional patch decoder.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across 7 multivariate benchmarks, reducing average MSE by 12% compared to strong recent baselines, with improved parameter efficiency and training stability.

Conclusion: The heterogeneous specialization approach effectively handles diverse temporal patterns in long-term forecasting, demonstrating the value of using specialized expert types rather than homogeneous experts.

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series can exhibit intricate multi-scale structures, including global trends, local periodicities, and non-stationary regimes, which makes long-horizon forecasting challenging. Although sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches improve scalability and specialization, they typically rely on homogeneous MLP experts that poorly capture the diverse temporal dynamics of time series data. We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons. We validate across seven multivariate benchmarks and multiple horizons, with MoHETS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average MSE by $12\%$ compared to strong recent baselines, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting.

*Jinhang Chai,Xuyuan Liu,Elynn Chen,Yujun Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a transfer learning framework for structured matrix estimation under dimension growth, decomposing target parameters into source embeddings, low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, with an anchored alternating projection estimator that achieves improved rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning systems expand features over time, embedding earlier representations into larger spaces with limited new latent structure; the paper addresses how to leverage well-estimated source tasks when both ambient and intrinsic dimensions grow simultaneously.

Method: Proposes a general framework where target parameters decompose into embedded source components, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits; develops an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves transferred subspaces while estimating only low-dimensional innovations and sparse modifications.

Result: Establishes deterministic error bounds separating target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank/sparsity increments are small; applies to Markov transition matrices (with dependent noise guarantees) and covariance estimation (with empirical validation).

Conclusion: The framework provides a theoretically grounded approach for transfer learning in growing representation settings, achieving improved estimation rates by exploiting expansion structure and effectively leveraging source knowledge across canonical matrix estimation problems.

Abstract: Learning systems often expand their ambient features or latent representations over time, embedding earlier representations into larger spaces with limited new latent structure. We study transfer learning for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth of the ambient dimension and the intrinsic representation, where a well-estimated source task is embedded as a subspace of a higher-dimensional target task.
  We propose a general transfer framework in which the target parameter decomposes into an embedded source component, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, and develop an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves transferred subspaces while estimating only low-dimensional innovations and sparse modifications. We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small.
  We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems. For Markov transition matrix estimation from a single trajectory, we derive end-to-end theoretical guarantees under dependent noise. For structured covariance estimation under enlarged dimensions, we provide complementary theoretical analysis in the appendix and empirically validate consistent transfer gains.

Motivation: 决策聚焦学习通过训练模型直接提升决策质量而非仅关注预测准确率，但组合优化问题的微分挑战依赖于扰动近似方法。研究发现，学习阶段扰动强度的波动会导致训练失效，这一问题亟待解决。

Method: 通过建立扰动强度波动与组合优化解稳定性之间的理论联系，提出在估计成本向量中引入正则化项，以增强学习过程对扰动波动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 针对组合优化问题中目标函数系数估计，所提出的正则化策略有效解决了扰动强度波动导致的训练不稳定性问题，为决策聚焦学习提供了更可靠的训练框架。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning integrates predictive modeling and combinatorial optimization by training models to directly improve decision quality rather than prediction accuracy alone. Differentiating through combinatorial optimization problems represents a central challenge, and recent approaches tackle this difficulty by introducing perturbation-based approximations. In this work, we focus on estimating the objective function coefficients of a combinatorial optimization problem. Our study demonstrates that fluctuations in perturbation intensity occurring during the learning phase can lead to ineffective training, by establishing a theoretical link to the notion of solution stability in combinatorial optimization. We propose addressing this issue by introducing a regularization of the estimated cost vectors which improves the robustness and reliability of the learning process, as demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明代码能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但将代码视为通用训练信号，未明确哪些代码特性（如结构复杂度）真正有助于增强推理能力。

Method: 使用圈复杂度和逻辑代码行数指标，研究两种场景：解决方案驱动复杂度（同一问题的不同解法）和问题驱动复杂度（不同任务本身）。构建受控微调数据集，并在多种推理基准上评估开源大语言模型。

Result: 在83%的实验中，将微调数据限制在特定结构复杂度范围比使用结构多样的代码训练表现更优，表明结构特性强烈决定代码对推理提升的有效性。

Conclusion: 代码虽能改善推理能力，但其效果高度依赖结构复杂度，这为超越规模扩展的数据中心改进路径提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to their capacity to generate chain-of-thought-style intermediate reasoning. Recent work suggests that exposure to code can further enhance these skills, but existing studies largely treat code as a generic training signal, leaving open the question of which properties of code actually contribute to improved reasoning. To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling.

Conclusion: PaPP提供实用化高能效mMIMO预编码方案，通过跨站点复用和快速微调解决部署难题，具备工程应用价值

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink precoding offers high spectral efficiency but remains challenging to deploy in practice because near-optimal algorithms such as the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) are computationally expensive, and sensitive to SNR and channel-estimation quality, while existing deep learning (DL)-based solutions often lack robustness and require retraining for each deployment site. This paper proposes a plug-and-play precoder (PaPP), a DL framework with a backbone that can be trained for either fully digital (FDP) or hybrid beamforming (HBF) precoding and reused across sites, transmit-power levels, and with varying amounts of channel estimation error, avoiding the need to train a new model from scratch at each deployment. PaPP combines a high-capacity teacher and a compact student with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate, trained using meta-learning domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Numerical results on ray-tracing data from three unseen sites show that the PaPP FDP and HBF models both outperform conventional and deep learning baselines, after fine-tuning with a small set of local unlabeled samples. Across both architectures, PaPP achieves more than 21$\times$ reduction in modeled computation energy and maintains good performance under channel-estimation errors, making it a practical solution for energy-efficient mMIMO precoding.

Conclusion: 揭示第三方模型的新型攻击向量，并研究防御措施

Abstract: Machine learning models are routinely deployed on a wide range of computing hardware. Although such hardware is typically expected to produce identical results, differences in its design can lead to small numerical variations during inference. In this work, we show that these variations can be exploited to create backdoors in machine learning models. The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware. This effect is achieved by locally moving the decision boundary close to a target input and then refining numerical deviations to flip the prediction on selected hardware. We empirically demonstrate that these hardware-triggered backdoors can be created reliably across common GPU accelerators. Our findings reveal a novel attack vector affecting the use of third-party models, and we investigate different defenses to counter this threat.

### [283] [LoRIF: Low-Rank Influence Functions for Scalable Training Data Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21929)
*Shuangqi Li,Hieu Le,Jingyi Xu,Mathieu Salzmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes LoRIF, a low-rank influence function method that exploits gradient structures to reduce storage from O(D) to O(c√D) and Hessian memory from O(D²) to O(Dr), achieving 20× speedup while maintaining attribution quality for large-scale models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gradient-based training data attribution methods face a scalability-quality tradeoff: random projection techniques require storing O(D) gradients per example and O(D²) memory for Hessian approximation, where increasing projection dimension D improves quality but worsens I/O latency and memory bottlenecks, limiting practicality for large models.

Method: LoRIF exploits low-rank gradient structures through two innovations: (1) storing rank-c factors of projected per-example gradients instead of full matrices, reducing per-layer-per-sample storage to O(c√D); (2) using truncated SVD with Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an r-dimensional subspace, reducing memory to O(Dr).

Result: Evaluated on models from 0.1B to 70B parameters with millions of training examples, LoRIF achieves up to 20× storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA, while matching or exceeding its attribution quality.

Conclusion: LoRIF breaks the quality-scalability tradeoff in gradient-based training data attribution, making it practical for frontier-scale models by leveraging low-rank approximations to dramatically reduce computational and storage overhead.

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) identifies which training examples most influenced a model's prediction. The best-performing TDA methods exploits gradients to define an influence function. To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \emph{(ii)} forming the $D \times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality--scalability tradeoff. We introduce \textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$. On models from 0.1B to 70B parameters trained on datasets with millions of examples, LoRIF achieves up to 20$\times$ storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA, while matching or exceeding its attribution quality. LoRIF makes gradient-based TDA practical at frontier scale.

Conclusion: 理论突破维度限制约束，实践提供高效采样方案，为扩散模型提供更普适的分析工具和优化路径

Abstract: Diffusion generative models synthesize samples by discretizing reverse-time dynamics driven by a learned score (or denoiser). Existing convergence analyses of diffusion models typically scale at least linearly with the ambient dimension, and sharper rates often depend on intrinsic-dimension assumptions or other geometric restrictions on the target distribution. We develop an alternative, information-theoretic approach to dimension-free convergence that avoids any geometric assumptions. Under mild assumptions on the target distribution, we bound KL divergence between the target and generated distributions by $O(H^2/K)$ (up to endpoint factors), where $H$ is the Shannon entropy and $K$ is the number of sampling steps. Moreover, using a reformulation of the KL divergence, we propose a Loss-Adaptive Schedule (LAS) for efficient discretization of reverse SDE which is lightweight and relies only on the training loss, requiring no post-training heavy computation. Empirically, LAS improves sampling quality over common heuristic schedules.

Conclusion: 概念瓶颈模型的设计选择显著影响其可解释性，需要在性能和可解释性间谨慎平衡。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across fields has amplified concerns about model interpretability. Distressingly, these models are often treated as black-boxes, with limited or non-existent investigation of their decision making process. Despite numerous post- and ante-hoc interepretability methods, systematic and objective evaluation of the learned representations remains limited, particularly for sparsity-aware methods that are increasingly considered to "induce interpretability". In this work, we focus on Concept Bottleneck Models and investigate how different modeling decisions affect the emerging representations. We introduce the notion of clarity, a measure, capturing the interplay between the downstream performance and the sparsity and precision of the concept representation, while proposing an interpretability assessment framework using datasets with ground truth concept annotations. We consider both VLM- and attribute predictor-based CBMs, and three different sparsity-inducing strategies: per example $\ell_1, \ell_0$ and Bernoulli-based formulations. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between flexibility and interpretability, under which a given method can exhibit markedly different behaviors even at comparable performance levels. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We propose Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) for medical multimodal learning with missing modalities, which models each modality as a Gaussian distribution to capture uncertainty and uses dynamic message-passing on a patient-modality graph for adaptive aggregation, achieving 2.26% and 2.17% AUC-ROC improvements on MIMIC-IV and eICU mortality prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical multimodal learning faces challenges with missing modalities in clinical practice; existing methods assume equal modality contribution and random missing patterns, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical data acquisition.

Method: AUM explicitly quantifies unimodal aleatoric uncertainty by modeling each modality representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution, then employs a dynamic message-passing mechanism on a bipartite patient-modality graph with uncertainty-aware aggregation to adaptively emphasize reliable information while naturally handling missing modalities.

Result: The framework achieves 2.26% AUC-ROC improvement on MIMIC-IV mortality prediction and 2.17% gain on eICU, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: AUM effectively addresses missing modalities in medical multimodal learning by explicitly modeling aleatoric uncertainty and dynamically weighting reliable modality information through principled uncertainty quantification and aggregation.

Abstract: Medical multimodal learning faces significant challenges with missing modalities prevalent in clinical practice. Existing approaches assume equal contribution of modality and random missing patterns, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical data acquisition. In this regard, we propose the Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) that explicitly quantifies unimodal aleatoric uncertainty to address missing modalities. Specifically, AUM models each unimodal representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to capture aleatoric uncertainty and enable principled modality reliability quantification. To adaptively aggregate captured information, we develop a dynamic message-passing mechanism within a bipartite patient-modality graph using uncertainty-aware aggregation mechanism. Through this process, missing modalities are naturally accommodated, while more reliable information from available modalities is dynamically emphasized to guide representation generation. Our AUM framework achieves an improvement of 2.26% AUC-ROC on MIMIC-IV mortality prediction and 2.17% gain on eICU, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: An agent operating in an unknown dynamical system must learn its dynamics from observations. Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware data-based optimization (UA-DBO) framework that uses a probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate model to quantify prediction uncertainty and penalize high-uncertainty samples during aerodynamic shape optimization, demonstrating improved performance and robustness over standard DBO while being faster than full computational simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-based optimization (DBO) for aerodynamic shape optimization heavily relies on training data quality; samples outside the training distribution cause significant prediction errors that can mislead the optimization process, making uncertainty quantification critical for detecting outliers and enhancing robustness.

Method: The study proposes a UA-DBO framework that develops a probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate model to predict output uncertainties, which are integrated into a model-confidence-aware objective function to penalize samples with large prediction errors during the optimization process.

Result: Evaluated on two multipoint airfoil optimization problems (drag divergence and buffet performance), UA-DBO consistently reduced prediction errors and achieved superior performance gains compared to original DBO, while offering comparable effectiveness to full simulations but with significantly faster optimization speed.

Conclusion: The UA-DBO framework successfully addresses uncertainty issues in DBO, improving robustness and performance of aerodynamic shape optimization while maintaining computational efficiency, making it a promising approach for complex engineering design problems.

Abstract: Data-based optimization (DBO) offers a promising approach for efficiently optimizing shape for better aerodynamic performance by leveraging a pretrained surrogate model for offline evaluations during iterations. However, DBO heavily relies on the quality of the training database. Samples outside the training distribution encountered during optimization can lead to significant prediction errors, potentially misleading the optimization process. Therefore, incorporating uncertainty quantification into optimization is critical for detecting outliers and enhancing robustness. This study proposes an uncertainty-aware data-based optimization (UA-DBO) framework to monitor and minimize surrogate model uncertainty during DBO. A probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate model is developed to predict uncertainties associated with its outputs, and these uncertainties are integrated into a model-confidence-aware objective function to penalize samples with large prediction errors during data-based optimization process. The UA-DBO framework is evaluated on two multipoint optimization problems aimed at improving airfoil drag divergence and buffet performance. Results demonstrate that UA-DBO consistently reduces prediction errors in optimized samples and achieves superior performance gains compared to original DBO. Moreover, compared to multipoint optimization based on full computational simulations, UA-DBO offers comparable optimization effectiveness while significantly accelerating optimization speed.

TL;DR: 提出GANPO方法，通过对抗式潜在空间正则化改进语言模型偏好优化，比传统token级正则化更鲁棒且性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于人类反馈的偏好优化依赖token级正则化，但token空间相似性无法保证语义或行为相似性，导致优化效果受限。

Method: 引入GANPO：采用GAN思想，通过对抗训练最小化策略模型与参考模型的内部表征差异，将潜在空间正则化集成到离线偏好优化目标中。

Result: 在多模型和任务中，潜在空间正则化带来一致提升；GANPO在分布偏移和噪声下提供更强结构反馈，且计算开销小，下游性能与token级相当。

Conclusion: 潜在空间正则化优于token级方法，GANPO能有效提升语言模型偏好优化的鲁棒性，为高效人类反馈学习提供新方向。

Abstract: Learning from human feedback typically relies on preference optimization that constrains policy updates through token-level regularization. However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization. Further, by comparing GANPO-induced inferential biases with those from token-level regularization, we find that GANPO provides more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise while maintaining comparable downstream performance with minor computational overhead.

TL;DR: 提出IGETR混合推理框架，结合GNN的结构化时序建模与LLM的上下文理解能力，通过三阶段流水线解决时序知识图谱推理中结构信息利用不足的问题，在标准基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based时序知识图谱推理方法过度依赖上下文关系而忽视结构关系，导致难以从动态图中提取相关子图，产生结构化信息理解不足和时序不一致的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出IGETR（图与编辑增强时序推理集成）混合框架：1）用时序GNN识别结构-时序一致的候选路径；2）LLM引导路径编辑修正逻辑语义不一致；3）融合优化路径生成可解释预测。

Result: 在ICEWS数据集上实现SOTA性能，Hits@1相对提升5.6%，Hits@3相对提升8.1%；消融实验验证各组件有效性。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效结合了GNN的结构化推理优势与LLM的语义理解能力，为时序知识图谱推理提供了更可靠和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) aims to predict future events by inferring missing entities with dynamic knowledge structures. Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FID广泛用于评估合成图像质量，但其依赖ImageNet预训练模型，在医学图像上效果不佳，且失败程度尚不明确。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛Dropout计算FID预测方差和特征嵌入模型的潜在表示方差，在增强的ImageNet1K验证集及其他外部数据集上测试。

Result: 预测方差大小与测试输入相对于训练数据的分布外程度呈不同程度相关，为将其用作FID可信度指标提供了洞见。

Conclusion: 这些方差指标可用于评估FID的可靠性，特别适用于医学图像等分布外数据。

Abstract: Feature embeddings acquired from pretrained models are widely used in medical applications of deep learning to assess the characteristics of datasets; e.g. to determine the quality of synthetic, generated medical images. The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is one popular synthetic image quality metric that relies on the assumption that the characteristic features of the data can be detected and encoded by an InceptionV3 model pretrained on ImageNet1K (natural images). While it is widely known that this makes it less effective for applications involving medical images, the extent to which the metric fails to capture meaningful differences in image characteristics is not obviously known. Here, we use Monte Carlo dropout to compute the predictive variance in the FID as well as a supplemental estimate of the predictive variance in the feature embedding model's latent representations. We show that the magnitudes of the predictive variances considered exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs (ImageNet1K validation set augmented at various strengths, and other external datasets) are out-of-distribution relative to its training data, providing some insight into the effectiveness of their use as indicators of the trustworthiness of the FID.

TL;DR: StepShield是首个评估AI智能体安全违规检测时机的基准，而非仅评估是否检测到，揭示了早期干预与事后分析的关键差异，并量化了其经济价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体安全基准仅报告二元准确率，混淆了早期干预与事后分析的价值差异，无法衡量检测时机的关键性。

Method: 构建包含9,213条代码智能体轨迹的数据集（1,278条训练对，7,935条测试轨迹），基于六类真实安全事件标注；提出三个时序指标：早期干预率(EIR)、干预间隔和节省令牌数。

Result: LLM评判器达到59% EIR，而静态分析器仅26%，性能差距达2.3倍；级联检测器HybridGuard降低监控成本75%，企业规模五年可节省1.08亿美元。

Conclusion: 通过将评估重点从“是否检测到”转向“何时检测到”，StepShield为构建更安全可靠且经济可行的AI智能体提供了新基础。

Abstract: Existing agent safety benchmarks report binary accuracy, conflating early intervention with post-mortem analysis. A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents.

Abstract: Discovering superior circuit topologies requires navigating an exponentially large design space-a challenge traditionally reserved for human experts.

*Yunyang Li,Lin Huang,Luojia Xia,Wenhe Zhang,Mark Gerstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Elign is a post-training framework that uses a machine-learning force field and reinforcement learning (FED-GRPO) to generate stable 3D molecular conformations with lower energy, while maintaining fast inference speed by amortizing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E(3)-equivariant diffusion models for molecular conformation generation either reproduce training data biases or require expensive, repeated quantum-chemical evaluations during physics-based guidance, making them computationally inefficient.

Method: Elign amortizes costs by: (1) replacing DFT with a pretrained ML force field for physical signals, and (2) formulating reverse diffusion as RL with FED-GRPO, which uses independently optimized energy and stability rewards during training to eliminate runtime queries.

Result: Elign generates conformations with lower DFT energies and forces while improving stability. Crucially, inference is as fast as unguided sampling since no energy evaluations are required during generation.

Conclusion: Elign successfully combines ML efficiency with physical accuracy for molecular conformation generation, achieving higher quality without sacrificing inference speed.

Abstract: Generative models for 3D molecular conformations must respect Euclidean symmetries and concentrate probability mass on thermodynamically favorable, mechanically stable structures. However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出负主导对比学习(NDCL)解决不平衡域泛化问题，通过理论建立泛化边界，并采用增强类间边界分离、类内紧凑性和域间后验一致性的技术方法，在基准测试中验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不平衡域泛化(IDG)同时面临域偏移和标签偏移的双重挑战，在异构长尾分布下极具现实意义但研究不足，主要由于技术复杂性和理论基石的缺乏。

Method: 首先理论建立IDG的泛化边界，揭示后验差异和决策边界的关键作用；进而提出NDCL方法：通过负主导对比学习增强类间边界分离并放大少数类梯度信号，采用重加权交叉熵促进类内紧凑性，并通过预测中心对齐强制域间后验一致性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的严格实验验证了所提NDCL方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文为IDG提供了理论基石，提出的NDCL通过直接调控决策边界有效解决了不平衡域泛化问题，为处理域和标签偏移提供了新思路。

Abstract: Imbalanced Domain Generalization (IDG) focuses on mitigating both domain and label shifts, both of which fundamentally shape the model's decision boundaries, particularly under heterogeneous long-tailed distributions across domains. Despite its practical significance, it remains underexplored, primarily due to the technical complexity of handling their entanglement and the paucity of theoretical foundations. In this paper, we begin by theoretically establishing the generalization bound for IDG, highlighting the role of posterior discrepancy and decision margin. This bound motivates us to focus on directly steering decision boundaries, marking a clear departure from existing methods. Subsequently, we technically propose a novel Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for IDG to enhance discriminability while enforce posterior consistency across domains. Specifically, inter-class decision-boundary separation is enhanced by placing greater emphasis on negatives as the primary signal in our contrastive learning, naturally amplifying gradient signals for minority classes to avoid the decision boundary being biased toward majority classes. Meanwhile, intra-class compactness is encouraged through a re-weighted cross-entropy strategy, and posterior consistency across domains is enforced through a prediction-central alignment strategy. Finally, rigorous yet challenging experiments on benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our NDCL. The code is available at https://github.com/Alrash/NDCL.

Conclusion: 该框架通过原则性压缩实现了高效的Transformer推理，同时通过率失真分析和PAC边界提供了理论可解释性，为理解性能提供了统一视角。

Abstract: Transformers achieve superior performance on many tasks, but impose heavy compute and memory requirements during inference. This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds. We further develop probably approximately correct (PAC)-style bounds for estimating this gap. For different architectures and tasks, we empirically demonstrate that their rates are driven by these bounds, adding to the explainability of the formulation.

Conclusion: STARS通过基于流形的激活引导有效解决了模式崩溃问题，为多样化文本生成提供了实用的无需训练解决方案。

Abstract: Language models often default to a narrow set of high-probability outputs, leaving their generation paths homogeneous and prone to mode collapse. Sampling-based strategies inject randomness but still struggle to guarantee diversity across multiple concurrent generation runs. We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\textbf{R}$ea$\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize. For test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks, STARS consistently outperforms standard sampling methods, achieving greater diversity without sacrificing qualitative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a mechanistic framework that geometrically interprets catastrophic forgetting in continual learning as transformations to individual feature encodings, identifying two mechanisms (capacity reduction and readout disruption), formalizing this through a tractable model, showing depth's detrimental effects, and demonstrating applicability to real models like Vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics for catastrophic forgetting only measure performance or last-layer representations, missing the underlying mechanisms that cause forgetting. A deeper understanding of how features transform during continual learning is needed.

Method: Develop a mechanistic framework with geometric interpretation; analyze a tractable model to formalize mechanisms; conduct experiments to validate analysis; apply framework to practical models using Crosscoders; perform case study on Vision Transformer trained on sequential CIFAR-10.

Result: Identified two mechanisms of forgetting: feature capacity reduction and readout disruption; formalized best- and worst-case scenarios through tractable model analysis; empirically confirmed the analysis; found depth is detrimental to continual learning; successfully applied framework to real Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: The paper provides a new feature-centric vocabulary for understanding catastrophic forgetting, offering deeper mechanistic insights beyond traditional performance metrics, with practical applications to modern architectures.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning is often measured at the performance or last-layer representation level, overlooking the underlying mechanisms. We introduce a mechanistic framework that offers a geometric interpretation of catastrophic forgetting as the result of transformations to the encoding of individual features. These transformations can lead to forgetting by reducing the allocated capacity of features (worse representation) and disrupting their readout by downstream computations. Analysis of a tractable model formalizes this view, allowing us to identify best- and worst-case scenarios. Through experiments on this model, we empirically test our formal analysis and highlight the detrimental effect of depth. Finally, we demonstrate how our framework can be used in the analysis of practical models through the use of Crosscoders. We present a case study of a Vision Transformer trained on sequential CIFAR-10. Our work provides a new, feature-centric vocabulary for continual learning.

Abstract: The quality of machine learning models depends heavily on their training data. Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance. Furthermore, in a comprehensive experimental study, we demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm compared to other classifier-based filtering methods.

Method: 提出Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR)：利用无关视觉输入预测理想后遗忘token分布，以此正则化遗忘过程以优先处理关键token；通过信息熵定义关键token，并从token级梯度重加权角度解释其有效性。

Conclusion: ViKeR通过视觉引导的token级正则化机制，为MLLM遗忘提供了更精细化的解决方案，有效平衡了遗忘效果与模型性能保持。

Abstract: Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the model from revealing private information when queried about target images. Existing MLLM unlearning methods largely adopt approaches developed for LLMs. They treat all answer tokens uniformly, disregarding their varying importance in the unlearning process. Moreover, these methods focus exclusively on the language modality, disregarding visual cues that indicate key tokens in answers. In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens. Further, we define key tokens in unlearning via information entropy and discuss ViKeR's effectiveness through token-level gradient reweighting, which amplifies updates on key tokens. Experiments on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively performs unlearning while mitigating forgetting and maintaining response coherence.

Result: 降低遗忘-保留特征表示纠缠，提升主流遗忘方法效果，且不引入额外隐私风险

Conclusion: 为未来研究提供理论洞察，推动通过重塑表示空间彻底移除遗忘概念的方法发展

Abstract: Most LLM unlearning methods aim to approximate retrain-from-scratch behaviors with minimal distribution shift, often via alignment-style objectives defined in the prediction space. While effective at reducing forgotten content generation, such approaches may act as suppression: forgotten concepts can persist in representations and remain entangled with retained knowledge. We introduce CLReg, a contrastive representation regularizer that identifies forget features while pushing them away from retain features, explicitly reducing forget-retain interference with minimal shifts on retain features. We provide first theoretical insights that relate representation shaping to entanglement reduction. Across unlearning benchmarks and LLMs of different sizes, CLReg decreases forget-retain representation entanglement that facilitates mainstream unlearning methods without positing extra privacy risks, inspiring future work that reshapes the representation space to remove forget concepts.

Abstract: We introduce a new multivariate statistical problem that we refer to as the Ensemble Inverse Problem (EIP). The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors. We benchmark the proposed method on several synthetic and real datasets in inverse imaging, HEP, and FWI. The codes are available at https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/The-Ensemble-Inverse-Problem--Applications-and-Methods.

Motivation: 标准任务算术在移除隐私信息时会导致过度遗忘，破坏了对保留其他信息至关重要的参数。观察到不同参数对遗忘与保留的重要性存在差异。

Method: 提出参数级任务算术(PerTA)机制，通过梯度(PerTA-grad)或对角Fisher信息近似(PerTA-fisher)估计各参数的相对重要性权重，对任务向量进行参数级重缩放调整。

Result: 大量实验表明，PerTA持续优于标准任务算术，在许多情况下在遗忘效果和整体模型效用方面均超越了基于训练的去学习方法。

Conclusion: PerTA在保持任务算术效率的同时有效缓解了过度遗忘问题，为LLM去学习提供了一个原则性且实用的框架。

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) unlearning, private information is required to be removed. Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility. By retaining the efficiency of task arithmetic while mitigating over-forgetting, PerTA offers a principled and practical framework for LLM unlearning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel generative machine learning framework that integrates the AdS/CFT holographic principle from quantum gravity with flow-matching algorithms. By using the bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in anti-de Sitter space, the method achieves faster and higher-quality convergence on toy and MNIST datasets compared to standard flow-matching, offering a physically interpretable approach to generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how fundamental physics concepts, specifically the holographic principle (AdS/CFT correspondence) from quantum gravity, can be leveraged to create novel, physically interpretable paradigms in generative machine learning, potentially leading to more efficient and theoretically grounded AI models.

Method: The method involves representing data flow from a base distribution to a learned distribution using the bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in anti-de Sitter space (AdS). This integrates AdS/CFT physics with deep learning and transport theory to augment flow-matching algorithms, creating a physics-informed generative model.

Result: Experimental results on a checkerboard toy dataset and MNIST show that the proposed AdS-based flow-matching model achieves faster convergence and higher quality results compared to physics-free flow-matching models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that AdS physics and geometry provide a physically interpretable framework for generative modeling, establishing their utility in developing novel machine learning paradigms and opening new avenues for physics-inspired AI research.

Abstract: We present a framework for generative machine learning that leverages the holographic principle of quantum gravity, or to be more precise its manifestation as the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, with techniques for deep learning and transport theory. Our proposal is to represent the flow of data from a base distribution to some learned distribution using the bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in AdS. In the language of machine learning, we are representing and augmenting the flow-matching algorithm with AdS physics. Using a checkerboard toy dataset and MNIST, we find that our model achieves faster and higher quality convergence than comparable physics-free flow-matching models. Our method provides a physically interpretable version of flow matching. More broadly, it establishes the utility of AdS physics and geometry in the development of novel paradigms in generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD)，一种量化表示空间中数据组融合/可分离性的新度量，能区分融合改变与融合保持因素，具有线性复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化表示空间中数据组的融合与可分离性是表示学习的基本问题，尤其域偏移下。现有度量混淆几何位移等融合改变因素与全局缩放等融合保持因素，无法真实反映融合程度。

Method: 提出Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD)，隔离融合改变的几何结构，对融合保持变异保持鲁棒性，具备线性计算复杂度。

Result: 理论表征CFD的不变性与敏感性，合成实验验证；在真实域偏移数据集上，CFD比常用替代方法更准确预测下游泛化性能下降。

Conclusion: CFD为表示学习提供了理论坚实且可解释的距离度量。

Abstract: Quantifying degrees of fusion and separability between data groups in representation space is a fundamental problem in representation learning, particularly under domain shift. A meaningful metric should capture fusion-altering factors like geometric displacement between representation groups, whose variations change the extent of fusion, while remaining invariant to fusion-preserving factors such as global scaling and sampling-induced layout changes, whose variations do not. Existing distributional distance metrics conflate these factors, leading to measures that are not informative of the true extent of fusion between data groups. We introduce Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD), a principled measure that isolates fusion-altering geometry while remaining robust to fusion-preserving variations, with linear computational complexity. We characterize the invariance and sensitivity properties of CFD theoretically and validate them in controlled synthetic experiments. For practical utility on real-world datasets with domain shift, CFD aligns more closely with downstream generalization degradation than commonly used alternatives. Overall, CFD provides a theoretically grounded and interpretable distance measure for representation learning.

TL;DR: 本文通过对46个生成式AI模型、7种任务和1858种配置在NVIDIA H100和B200 GPU上的大规模研究，发现能耗存在数量级差异（任务类型差异达25倍，视频生成比图像多100倍以上），并提出了一个从算法/软件/硬件层面分析时间能耗机制的框架。

Motivation: 能源是机器学习计算的关键资源，测量能耗只是第一步，理解能耗差异的根本原因对于优化至关重要。

Method: 在NVIDIA H100和B200 GPU上，对46个模型、7种任务和1858种配置进行了大规模推理时间和能耗的实证研究。

Result: 发现显著的数量级差异：大语言模型任务类型导致25倍能耗差异，视频生成能耗有时超过图像的100倍，GPU利用率差异导致3-5倍能耗差异。

Conclusion: 提出了一个分析时间与能耗机制的框架，指出时间和能耗由内存和利用率等潜在指标决定，这些指标受算法、软件和硬件各层因素影响，并扩展至数据中心关键指标"每瓦吞吐量"。

Abstract: Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.

TL;DR: 一篇关于Transformer架构中归一化层位置问题的论文，通过流形优化视角重新思考Pre-Norm和Post-Norm，提出了名为GeoNorm的新方法，用测地线更新替代标准归一化，并引入层间更新衰减机制，实验证明其性能优于现有方法且计算成本极低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer架构中归一化层的放置位置（Pre-Norm与Post-Norm）仍是一个开放性问题，现有方法缺乏理论指导。论文从流形优化的角度重新审视这个问题，将FFN和注意力层的输出解释为优化方向，为理解归一化层的作用提供了新的理论框架。

Result: 综合实验表明，GeoNorm在Transformer模型中持续优于现有归一化方法，能够无缝集成到标准Transformer架构中，带来显著的性能提升而几乎不增加额外计算成本。

Conclusion: GeoNorm为Transformer归一化层设计提供了新的理论视角和实践方案，解决了Pre-Norm与Post-Norm的争论问题，是一种高效且易于实现的改进方法。

Abstract: The placement of normalization layers, specifically Pre-Norm and Post-Norm, remains an open question in Transformer architecture design. In this work, we rethink these approaches through the lens of manifold optimization, interpreting the outputs of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) and attention layers as update directions in optimization. Building on this perspective, we introduce GeoNorm, a novel method that replaces standard normalization with geodesic updates on the manifold. Furthermore, analogous to learning rate schedules, we propose a layer-wise update decay for the FFN and attention components. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GeoNorm consistently outperforms existing normalization methods in Transformer models. Crucially, GeoNorm can be seamlessly integrated into standard Transformer architectures, achieving performance improvements with negligible additional computational cost.

### [308] [Boosting CVaR Policy Optimization with Quantile Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22100)
*Yudong Luo,Erick Delage*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes augmenting CVaR optimization with an expected quantile term to improve sample efficiency of policy gradient methods, without changing the original CVaR objective, and shows superior empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CVaR-PG suffers from sample inefficiency because it only uses tail-end trajectories and ignores most sampled data.

Method: Augment CVaR with an expected quantile term that admits a dynamic programming formulation, enabling full use of all sampled trajectories while preserving the CVaR objective (since CVaR is the expectation of quantile over the tail).

Result: Empirical results in risk-averse domains show the algorithm substantially improves upon CVaR-PG and consistently outperforms other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the sample inefficiency problem in CVaR-PG while maintaining the same objective, leading to better performance.

Abstract: Optimizing Conditional Value-at-risk (CVaR) using policy gradient (a.k.a CVaR-PG) faces significant challenges of sample inefficiency. This inefficiency stems from the fact that it focuses on tail-end performance and overlooks many sampled trajectories. We address this problem by augmenting CVaR with an expected quantile term. Quantile optimization admits a dynamic programming formulation that leverages all sampled data, thus improves sample efficiency. This does not alter the CVaR objective since CVaR corresponds to the expectation of quantile over the tail. Empirical results in domains with verifiable risk-averse behavior show that our algorithm within the Markovian policy class substantially improves upon CVaR-PG and consistently outperforms other existing methods.

TL;DR: PIFM将图嵌入先验与流匹配结合，用于图重建，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从部分观测中重建图是一个关键挑战；经典嵌入方法缺乏全局一致性，而现代生成模型难以融入结构先验。

Method: 提出先验信息流匹配(PIFM)，基于置换等变的失真-感知理论，先用图元或GraphSAGE/node2vec等先验基于局部信息生成邻接矩阵的初始估计，再用校正流匹配进行细化，学习全局耦合。

Result: 在不同数据集上的实验表明，PIFM能持续提升经典嵌入方法，在重建精度上优于它们和先进生成基线。

Conclusion: PIFM通过有效整合结构先验，成功弥合了经典嵌入与现代生成模型在图重建中的差距。

Abstract: We introduce Prior-Informed Flow Matching (PIFM), a conditional flow model for graph reconstruction. Reconstructing graphs from partial observations remains a key challenge; classical embedding methods often lack global consistency, while modern generative models struggle to incorporate structural priors. PIFM bridges this gap by integrating embedding-based priors with continuous-time flow matching. Grounded in a permutation equivariant version of the distortion-perception theory, our method first uses a prior, such as graphons or GraphSAGE/node2vec, to form an informed initial estimate of the adjacency matrix based on local information. It then applies rectified flow matching to refine this estimate, transporting it toward the true distribution of clean graphs and learning a global coupling. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that PIFM consistently enhances classical embeddings, outperforming them and state-of-the-art generative baselines in reconstruction accuracy.

### [310] [Physics Informed Reconstruction of Four-Dimensional Atmospheric Wind Fields Using Multi-UAS Swarm Observations in a Synthetic Turbulent Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22111)
*Abdullah Tasim,Wei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for reconstructing 4D atmospheric wind fields using a coordinated UAS swarm, combining Bi-LSTM for local wind estimation with PINN for physics-informed reconstruction, achieving accurate results up to 1000m altitude without dedicated wind sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional instruments have spatio-temporal gaps in lower atmospheric boundary layer measurements, and individual UAS only sample wind along trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery needed for weather forecasting, hazard prediction, and wind energy assessment.

Method: A framework using coordinated UAS swarm measurements, synthetic turbulence environment, and high-fidelity multirotor simulation. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics via a bidirectional LSTM network, then assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct continuous 4D wind fields.

Result: Bi-LSTM local wind estimation achieves RMSE of 0.064-0.062 m/s (low wind), 0.122-0.129 m/s (moderate wind), and 0.271-0.273 m/s (high wind) for horizontal components. The PINN reconstruction recovers dominant wind structure up to 1000m altitude. Under moderate winds, overall RMSE is 0.118-0.154 m/s, with optimal performance from a five-UAS swarm.

Conclusion: Coordinated UAS swarm measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure, offering a promising solution for atmospheric monitoring applications.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of atmospheric wind fields is essential for applications such as weather forecasting, hazard prediction, and wind energy assessment, yet conventional instruments leave spatio-temporal gaps within the lower atmospheric boundary layer. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm. These results demonstrate that coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure.

Motivation: 模拟哈密顿系统的长时间演化受限于数值积分所需的小时间步长，导致计算效率低下，成为模拟长时间尺度的瓶颈。

Method: 引入平均流一致性条件，学习哈密顿流映射来预测选定时间跨度Δt内的平均相空间演化，从而能够直接利用独立的相空间样本进行训练，无需昂贵的轨迹生成。

Result: 在多种哈密顿系统上验证有效，显著改进了基于机器学习力场的分子动力学模拟；模型保持相当的训练和推理成本，但支持更大的积分步长，且可直接使用广泛可用的无轨迹MLFF数据集。

Conclusion: 该框架通过学习流映射克服了经典积分器的稳定性限制，实现了高效的大时间步长哈密顿系统模拟，为长时间尺度动力学研究提供了新途径。

Abstract: Simulating the long-time evolution of Hamiltonian systems is limited by the small timesteps required for stable numerical integration. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $Δt$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 公共模型库中数百万微调模型的使用高度集中在少数基础检查点上，但尚不清楚这是市场高效选择的结果，还是存在系统性忽视优秀模型的问题。

Method: 评估超过2000个模型寻找"隐藏宝石"，将模型发现问题形式化为多臂老虎机问题，并改进Sequential Halving算法，采用共享查询集和激进淘汰策略。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B家族中发现罕见下载的检查点可将数学性能从83.2%提升至96.0%且不增加推理成本；新方法仅需每个候选50次查询即可找到顶尖模型，发现速度提升50倍。

Conclusion: 模型社区确实忽视了众多高性能微调模型，所提出的加速搜索算法能高效发现这些隐藏宝石，解决了穷尽评估的计算不可行性。

Abstract: Public repositories host millions of fine-tuned models, yet community usage remains disproportionately concentrated on a small number of foundation checkpoints. We investigate whether this concentration reflects efficient market selection or if superior models are systematically overlooked. Through an extensive evaluation of over 2,000 models, we show the prevalence of "hidden gems", unpopular fine-tunes that significantly outperform their popular counterparts. Notably, within the Llama-3.1-8B family, we find rarely downloaded checkpoints that improve math performance from 83.2% to 96.0% without increasing inference costs. However, discovering these models through exhaustive evaluation of every uploaded model is computationally infeasible. We therefore formulate model discovery as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and accelerate the Sequential Halving search algorithm by using shared query sets and aggressive elimination schedules. Our method retrieves top models with as few as 50 queries per candidate, accelerating discovery by over 50x.

Conclusion: NGRC+ERT系统通过双次学习实现了多功能记忆任务，避免了繁琐的超参数优化，为类脑多记忆处理提供了新方案，同时揭示了短时记忆缺陷引发长时记忆错误的关键机制

Abstract: The brain combines short- and long-term memory to process, store, and recall multiple different pieces of information. Inspired by this and recent results on multifunctional and parameter-aware learning, we extend a new machine learning technique that combines short- and long-term memory units, specifically, a system consisting of a next-generation reservoir computer (NGRC) and extremely randomized trees (ERT), to process, store, and recall multiple different strange attractors. We train the combined NGRC+ERT system using a two-shot learning approach which significantly improves performance by filtering out unnecessary features, thereby avoiding extensive hyperparameter optimization. We first show that an NGRC+ERT system achieves highly accurate reconstruction of the short- and long-term dynamics of both the Lorenz and Halvorsen chaotic attractors when using an exponential filtering scheme. We validate these finding by training the NGRC+ERT system to reconstruct different pairs of attractors and also a greater number of attractors. We focus on the task of training a single NGRC+ERT system to reconstruct 16 different attractors and show that sufficient index-based separation in feature space suppresses unwanted switching dynamics, thus stabilizing long-term memory recall. Finally, we identify that defects in short-term memory processing can provoke failure modes in long-term memory recall resulting in confabulation.
