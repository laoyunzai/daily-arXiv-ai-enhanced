Extending such self-duality symmetries beyond gauging of abelian groups in tensor-product Hilbert spaces has, however, remained challenging. In this work, we construct a generalized 1+1d Ising model based on a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra $H$ that enjoys an anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry $\\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. We provide an intuitive diagrammatic formulation of both the Hamiltonian and the symmetry operators using a non-(co)commutative generalization of ZX-calculus built from Hopf-algebraic data. When $H$ is self-dual, we further construct a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality operator that exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and becomes a non-invertible symmetry at the self-dual point. This enlarged symmetry mixes with lattice translation and, in the infrared, flows to a weakly integral fusion category given by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of $\\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. Specializing to the Kac-Paljutkin algebra $H_8$, the smallest self-dual Hopf algebra beyond abelian group algebras, we numerically study the phase diagram and identify four of the six $\\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases, separated by Ising critical lines and meeting at a multicritical point.

We discover a large collection of mappings of these models onto three quantum chains: the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a spin-1 chain, and a kinetically constrained fermion chain whose configurations are best described in terms of tilings of a rectangular strip. We show that the twist of boundary conditions in the chains maps onto the transverse momentum of the electric field string, and their Drude weight to the inverse of the string mass per unit length. We numerically determine the phase diagrams for these spin chains, employing DMRG simulations and find global similarities but also many interesting new features in comparison to the full 2D problems. For example, the spin-1 chain we obtain features a continuous family of degenerate ground states at its RK point analogous to a Bloch sphere, but without an underlying microscopic global $SU(2)$ symmetry. We also argue for the existence of a (stable) Landau-forbidden gapless critical point away from the RK point in one of the models we study using bosonization and numerics. This is surprising given that the full 2D problem is generically gapped away from the RK point. The same model also displays extensively many local conserved quantities which fragment the Hilbert space, arising as a consequence of destructive resonances between the electric field lines. Our findings highlight spin-chain mappings as a potent technique for the exploration of unusual dynamics, exotic criticality, and low-energy physics in lattice gauge theories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u51c6\u4e00\u7ef4Rokhsar-Kivelson\u4e8c\u805a\u4f53\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u51b0\u6a21\u578b\uff08U(1)-\u683c\u70b9\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e09\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\uff08XXZ\u94fe\u3001\u81ea\u65cb-1\u94fe\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u94fe\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u5f26\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7DMRG\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5947\u5f02\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u65e0SU(2)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7b80\u5e76\u57fa\u6001\u3001\u8fdc\u79bbRK\u70b9\u5904\u8fdd\u53cd\u6717\u9053\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u788e\u7247\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u6620\u5c04\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u683c\u70b9\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76U(1)-\u683c\u70b9\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u5c11\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u5f26\uff08\u95ed\u5408\u7535\u573a\u7ebf\uff09\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51c6\u4e00\u7ef4\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4f4e\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5c06RK\u4e8c\u805a\u4f53\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u51b0\u6a21\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e09\u7c7b\u91cf\u5b50\u94fe\uff1a1/2\u81ea\u65cbXXZ\u94fe\u3001\u81ea\u65cb-1\u94fe\u548c\u7528\u77e9\u5f62\u6761\u5e26\u5bc6\u94fa\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u94fe\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u626d\u66f2\u4e0e\u7535\u573a\u5f26\u6a2a\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u6620\u5c04Drude\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u5f26\u5355\u4f4d\u957f\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53cd\u6bd4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u91c7\u7528DMRG\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u503c\u786e\u5b9a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u7684\u76f8\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u65b0\u7279\u5f81\uff1a1\uff09\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u81ea\u65cb-1\u94fe\u5728RK\u70b9\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u7b80\u5e76\u57fa\u6001\u65cf\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5e03\u6d1b\u8d6b\u7403\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u5fae\u89c2SU(2)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fdc\u79bbRK\u70b9\u5904\u5b58\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6717\u9053\u7981\u6212\u65e0\u80fd\u9699\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6574\u4e8c\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u5728RK\u70b9\u4e4b\u5916\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5e26\u9699\u7684\uff1b3\uff09\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5927\u91cf\u5c40\u57df\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u7535\u573a\u7ebf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u6d88\u5171\u632f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u6620\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u683c\u70b9\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u53cd\u5e38\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5b8c\u6574\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

Their effective description by nonlinear field theories reflects an energetic frustration that destabilizes uniform order while selecting finite-size, topologically nontrivial configurations as stationary states. Among the most extreme realizations are atomically-sharp domain wall excitations, namely one-dimensional (1D) magnetic solitons, which represent the ultimate scaling limit of magnetic textures. Such solitons may emerge in magnetic systems where effective exchange interactions compete directly with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Here we show that the square-net rare earth compound EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ realizes a very susceptible regime where the magnetic anisotropy competes with highly frustrated exchange interactions stabilizing a rare ferrimagnetic $\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow$ state that, under applied magnetic field, supports the formation of atomically-sharp soliton defects. We confirm the bulk response of the 1D magnetic solitons via magnetization and electrical transport measurements. We establish both the zero- and in-field $\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow$ order via neutron diffraction, while magnetic force microscopy visualizes its real-space evolution into a stripe-like array. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the soliton, we relate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-driven exchange interactions and the magnetic anisotropy through density functional theory, and we construct an effective 1D $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$K$ model whose atomistic spin dynamics simulations reproduce the observed soliton states as a function of external field.

Several theoretical proposals were considered for these systems. The Coulomb interaction between electrons allow a new approach to study this problem. In this paper, we use a usual Hubbard model with a local repulsive interaction to describe a 2D system. The system of equations are solved using the Green's functions method, within a Hubbard-I mean field approximation, which allows to treat the strong interaction limit. We consider both cases of attractive and repulsive interactions and obtain the zero temperature phase diagram of the model. Our results show, in the repulsive case, the existence of a superconducting ground state mediated by the kinetic electronic energy and described by a non-local order parameter. A minimum value of the repulsive interaction $U_{min}$ is required to create a pairing state. At finite temperatures, for strong interactions, the critical temperature $T_c$ shows a saturation similar to the Bose-Einstein condensation observed for strong attractive interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528Hubbard\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Hubbard-I\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b\u6c42\u89e3\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6392\u65a5\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5b50\u52a8\u80fd\u4ecb\u5bfc\u5f62\u6210\u8d85\u5bfc\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u5448\u73b0\u9971\u548c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8d85\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u662f\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7269\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5438\u5f15\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5e93\u4ed1\u6392\u65a5\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u5426\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d85\u5bfc\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u542b\u5c40\u57df\u6392\u65a5\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4Hubbard\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Hubbard-I\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u96f6\u6e29\u548c\u6709\u9650\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u56fe\u3002", "result": "1. \u6392\u65a5\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u7531\u7535\u5b50\u52a8\u80fd\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u57fa\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u6700\u5c0f\u6392\u65a5\u5f3a\u5ea6U_min\u89e6\u53d1\uff1b2. \u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5e8f\u53c2\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u914d\u5bf9\u6001\uff1b3. \u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6Tc\u5448\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\u7684\u9971\u548c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e93\u4ed1\u6392\u65a5\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u9a71\u52a8\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u52a8\u80fd\u9879\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u9650\u6e29\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u63ed\u793a\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u666e\u9002\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u8d85\u5bfc\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\\mathbb{C},$ $\\mathbb{R},$ $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\\mathbb{Q}.$ In particular, we use this to compute the permanents of DFT and Schur matrices far beyond the ranges hitherto known. On the experimental side, we present two new observations. First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{CN}(0,\u03c3^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \\emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $\u03b1$-stable distribution with stability index $\u03b1\\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $\u03b1=2$.\n  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\\frac{1}{n}\\ln|\\perm(\u03b3(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \\[\n  \\perm(\u03b3({\\textstyle\\frac12}))\n  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\\cdot 2e^{-n}\\bigl(1+\\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\\bigr) \\] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. For the geodesic to the DFT matrix, the permanent recovers $10$--$40$ times above its valley minimum when $n$ is prime, but not when $n$ is composite -- a geodesic fingerprint of primality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7GPU\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6570\u3001\u5b9e\u6570\u3001\u6709\u9650\u57df\u548c\u6709\u7406\u6570\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) Haar unitary\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u670d\u4ece\u590d\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800cDFT\u77e9\u9635\u5728\u7d20\u6570\u7ef4\u6570\u4e0b\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff1b\u6b63\u4ea4\u77e9\u9635\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9ad8\u65af\u4f46\u5cf0\u5ea6\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u9ad8\u65af\u7cfb\u7efc\u77e9\u9635\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u670d\u4ece\u03b1-\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\u30022) \u5728unitary\u7fa4\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u4e0a\uff0c\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\u666e\u9002\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0eDFT\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u80fd\u6307\u7eb9\u5316\u7ef4\u6570\u7684\u7d20\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5927\u77e9\u9635\u7814\u7a76\uff1bDFT\u77e9\u9635\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u4e0e\u7d20\u6570\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1a\u5229\u7528GPU\u5e76\u884c\u52a0\u901f\u5404\u6570\u57df\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6269\u5c55DFT/Schur\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u5bf9Haar unitary/orthogonal\u77e9\u9635\u3001GUE/GOE/Ginibre\u7cfb\u7efc\u8fdb\u884c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u91c7\u6837\u7edf\u8ba1\uff1b\u6cbfunitary\u7fa4\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "1) \u8bc1\u5b9eHaar unitary\u77e9\u9635\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u670d\u4eceC N(0,\u03c3\u00b2)\uff0cDFT\u77e9\u9635\u5728\u7d20\u6570n\u22657\u65f6\u4e3a\u6781\u7aef\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff1b\u6b63\u4ea4\u77e9\u9635\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u9ad8\u65af\u4f46\u5cf0\u5ea6O(1/n)\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u9ad8\u65af\u7cfb\u7efc\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u670d\u4ece\u03b1\u22481.0-1.4\u7684\u03b1-\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\u30022) \u53d1\u73b0unitary\u7fa4\u5230\u7f6e\u6362\u77e9\u9635\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6807\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570f(t)=1/n ln|perm|\uff0c\u4e2d\u70b9\u503c\u5bf9\u5947\u6570n\u6709\u660e\u786e\u6e10\u8fd1\u5f0f\uff1b\u5230DFT\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5728\u7d20\u6570n\u65f6\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u56de\u534710-40\u500d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7d20\u6027\u6307\u7eb9\u3002", "conclusion": "GPU\u8ba1\u7b97\u7a81\u7834\u4f7f\u5927\u77e9\u9635\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u79ef\u548c\u5f0f\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u89c4\u5f8b\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u77e9\u9635\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u6570\u8bba\uff08\u7d20\u6027\uff09\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u6570\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We compute the topological complexity of equilibria, which quantifies how rapidly the number of equilibria of the dynamical equations grows with the total number of species. We perform the calculation for arbitrary degree of non-reciprocity in the interactions, distinguishing between configurations that are dynamically stable to invasions by species absent from the equilibrium, and those that are not.

We investigate the dynamical and statistical properties of a quartic mean-field Hamiltonian model, with particular emphasis on the relation between the thermodynamic limit and finite-size chaotic dynamics. We first analyze the thermodynamic limit of the model within the Vlasov collisionless framework and derive the corresponding self-consistent single-particle description. We identify the conditions under which the mean-field dynamics becomes effectively autonomous and show numerically that fluctuations of the relevant intensive quantities vanish algebraically with N, supporting the emergence of integrability as N goes to infinity. We then study the finite-N dynamics by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent over an exceptionally wide range of N, spanning several orders of magnitude. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponent decays algebraically with N, consistently with the suppression of chaos in the thermodynamic limit for mean-field Hamiltonian models. Using tools from non-extensive statistical mechanics, we further analyze the time evolution of the entropic index q and demonstrate that, although transient values q > 1 may appear at intermediate times, q systematically converges to unity as the observation time increases. This behavior indicates that the finite-N dynamics is strongly chaotic in the asymptotic regime and that previously reported q > 1 values for the present models originate from finite-time effects rather than from a persistent weakly chaotic phase.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56db\u6b21\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u548c\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u6291\u5236\u673a\u5236", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u96c6\u4f53\u6548\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6N\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6301\u7eed\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u6df7\u6c8c\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8fd9\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Vlasov\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5927\u8303\u56f4N\u503c\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u5927Lyapunov\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd0\u7528\u975e\u5e7f\u5ef6\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u5206\u6790\u71b5\u6307\u6570q\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u76f8\u5173\u5f3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6da8\u843d\u968fN\u4ee3\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff1b2) \u6700\u5927Lyapunov\u6307\u6570\u968fN\u4ee3\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6df7\u6c8c\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff1b3) \u71b5\u6307\u6570q\u867d\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0q>1\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u4e8e1", "conclusion": "\u6709\u9650N\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u6e10\u8fd1\u610f\u4e49\u4e0b\u662f\u5f3a\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u62a5\u9053\u7684q>1\u503c\u6e90\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u5e94\u800c\u975e\u6301\u7eed\u5f31\u6df7\u6c8c\u76f8\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u5728N\u2192\u221e\u65f6\u6d8c\u73b0\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u671f"}}

Prior work on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) prediction has relied primarily on structured variables (e.g., age, NIHSS) and conventional machine learning. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer future mRS scores directly from routine admission notes remains largely unexplored. We evaluated encoder (BERT, NYUTron) and generative (Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) LLMs, in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, for discharge and 90-day mRS prediction using a large, real-world stroke registry. The discharge outcome dataset included 9,485 History and Physical notes and the 90-day outcome dataset included 1,898 notes from the NYU Langone Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry (2016-2025). Data were temporally split with the most recent 12 months held out for testing. Performance was assessed using exact (7-class) mRS accuracy and binary functional outcome (mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6) accuracy and compared against established structured-data baselines incorporating NIHSS and age. Fine-tuned Llama achieved the highest performance, with 90-day exact mRS accuracy of 33.9% [95% CI, 27.9-39.9%] and binary accuracy of 76.3% [95% CI, 70.7-81.9%]. Discharge performance reached 42.0% [95% CI, 39.0-45.0%] exact accuracy and 75.0% [95% CI, 72.4-77.6%] binary accuracy. For 90-day prediction, Llama performed comparably to structured-data baselines. Fine-tuned LLMs can predict post-stroke functional outcomes from admission notes alone, achieving performance comparable to models requiring structured variable abstraction.

However, conclusive evidence for the QCP is lacking, as the presumed QCP is buried under the superconducting dome, disguising its presence. Here, we use high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to examine the dynamical charge-charge correlation in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and uncover the quantum critical scaling, a key feature required for a QCP. Specifically, \\djh{we observed that the inverse correlation lengths for various dopings and temperatures collapsed onto a universal scaling curve, yielding a critical exponent $\u03bd$ of $0.74 \\pm 0.08$. The non-negativity of this exponent confirms the presence of a QCP. Remarkably, the value of $\u03bd$ suggests that while the QCP is manifested through the charge-density wave, other orders also participate, such that the QCP appears to belong to the universality class characterized by the O(4) symmetry, reminiscent of the microscopic SO(4) symmetry in the Hubbard model at half-filling. Further analysis indicates that the QCP is highly dissipative with a short quasi-particle lifetime, reflecting the intertwined quantum fluctuations due to its being buried inside the superconducting state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5171\u632f\u975e\u5f39\u6027X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6563\u5c04\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cLa$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u70b9(QCP)\uff0c\u5176\u7535\u8377\u5173\u8054\u957f\u5ea6\u5448\u73b0\u666e\u9002\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e34\u754c\u6307\u6570\u03bd=0.74\u00b10.08\uff0c\u8868\u660eQCP\u5c5e\u4e8eO(4)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u666e\u9002\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e14\u56e0\u9690\u85cf\u5728\u8d85\u5bfc\u7a79\u9876\u4e0b\u800c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u8017\u6563\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u94dc\u9178\u76d0\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u56fe\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u88ab\u8d85\u5bfc\u7a79\u9876\u63a9\u76d6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5bf9\u94dc\u9178\u76d0\u8d85\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u5171\u632f\u975e\u5f39\u6027X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6563\u5c04\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63ba\u6742\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7535\u8377-\u7535\u8377\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u4e0d\u540c\u63ba\u6742\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u9006\u5173\u8054\u957f\u5ea6\u574d\u7f29\u5230\u4e00\u6761\u666e\u9002\u6807\u5ea6\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0a\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e34\u754c\u6307\u6570\u03bd=0.74\u00b10.08\uff0c\u5176\u6b63\u503c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86QCP\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff1b\u8be5\u6307\u6570\u503c\u6697\u793aQCP\u6d89\u53ca\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u6709\u5e8f\u6001\uff0c\u5c5e\u4e8eO(4)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u666e\u9002\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u4f53\u73b0\u4f46\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u91cd\u6709\u5e8f\u6001\uff0c\u5176O(4)\u666e\u9002\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u54c8\u4f2f\u5fb7\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u586b\u5145\u65f6\u7684\u5fae\u89c2SO(4)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\uff1b\u7531\u4e8e\u9690\u85cf\u5728\u8d85\u5bfc\u6001\u5185\u90e8\uff0cQCP\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u8017\u6563\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u5bff\u547d\u6781\u77ed\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u76f8\u4e92\u4ea4\u7ec7\u3002"}}

In this work, we generalize the protocol to scenarios where the initial entanglement shared between each two nodes of the network is not the same but has some randomness.

However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks.

However, its autonomous (closed-loop) operation is often plagued by inherent instability. Moreover, performance is highly sensitive to the reservoir's random initialization, leading to vulnerability to noise and/or behaviour that bears no resemblance whatsoever to the target dynamical system. Here we identify a primary cause of this unreliability: the emergence of excessive, spurious unstable or neutral modes in the closed-loop dynamics. We introduce a simple deterministic input layer design principle that directly addresses this vulnerability by structurally suppressing the emergence of these spurious modes a priori (before training). Our approach dramatically improves robustness to both initialization sensitivity and internal noise, doubling the prediction horizon. Furthermore, we demonstrate on chaotic dynamical systems that this design enables robust estimation of the full Lyapunov spectrum (100\\% success rate across 50 seeds), signifying that the autonomous RC faithfully emulates the essential properties of the target dynamical system.

This work performs the first large-scale study of the 1D Anderson-lattice underlying the Kondo necklace with quasi-exact numerical methods, comparing this with the perturbative effective 1D Kondo-necklace model derived from the former. This study is based on an exact mapping of the Anderson model to one of a superconducting pairing layer connected to a metallic reservoir which is valid in arbitrary spatial dimensions, thereby linking the previously disparate areas of reservoir-enhanced superconductivity, following Kivelson's pioneering proposals, and that of periodic Kondo-systems. Our work reveals that below the length-scales on which the insulating state sets in, which can be very large, superconducting and density-density correlations are degenerate and may both appear to approach an almost ordered state, to a degree that far exceeds that of any isolated 1D pairing layer with short-range interactions. We trace these effects to the effective extended-range coupling that the metallic layer mediates within the pairing layer. These results translate directly to the appearance of near-long-range magnetic order at intermediate scales in the Kondo-systems, and explain the strong renormalization of the RKKY-coupling that we effectively observe, in terms of the back-action of the pairing layer onto the metallic layer.

We find that the lack of time-reversal symmetry in cosmological settings generically leads to constructive or destructive interference between communication mediated correlations and harvested field correlations, dramatically affecting the entanglement that detectors can acquire.

In other words, each connected component of $H$ has at least $2$ vertices. This problem naturally arises in graph theory along with other variants of the well-studied Maximum Common Subgraph problem and also has applications in computational social choice. We show that this problem is NP-hard and provide an FPT algorithm when parameterized by $h$.

They remain an active area of research in modern stochastic thermodynamics. In particular, cyclic active heat engines have been shown to display a rich phenomenology, such as ``violations'' of the Carnot bound on efficiency and an improved performance in comparison to their passive counterparts. We introduce the concept of cyclic active refrigerators using a previously derived second law for cyclic active systems. We show that for cyclic active refrigerators, a naive definition of the coefficient of performance can exceed the bound set by the standard second law for passive refrigerators. We also show that cyclic active systems can behave like a Maxwell's demon, with heat flowing from the cold to the hot reservoir without any work input. Beyond this phase, cyclic active systems can enter a hybrid phase, functioning as both a heat engine and a refrigerator simultaneously. Our results are obtained with two models that involve active Brownian particles, a simpler one that allows for analytical results and a more realistic one that is analyzed through numerical simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5faa\u73af\u4e3b\u52a8\u5236\u51b7\u673a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u7cfb\u6570\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ea6\u514b\u65af\u97e6\u5996\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5faa\u73af\u4e3b\u52a8\u70ed\u673a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8fdd\u53cd\u5361\u8bfa\u6548\u7387\u754c\u9650\u7b49\u4e30\u5bcc\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f15\u5165\u5faa\u73af\u4e3b\u52a8\u5236\u51b7\u673a\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u7c7b\u4f3c\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u5e03\u6717\u7c92\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "1. \u5faa\u73af\u4e3b\u52a8\u5236\u51b7\u673a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7cfb\u6570\u53ef\u8d85\u8fc7\u88ab\u52a8\u5236\u51b7\u673a\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u754c\u9650\uff1b2. \u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u9ea6\u514b\u65af\u97e6\u5996\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u529f\u8f93\u5165\u5373\u53ef\u4f7f\u70ed\u4ece\u51b7\u5e93\u6d41\u5411\u70ed\u5e93\uff1b3. \u8fdb\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u70ed\u673a\u548c\u5236\u51b7\u673a\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u975e\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning.

Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping.

However, current evaluation frameworks lack a consensus metric and suffer from two critical flaws: they often assume independence across time steps or variables, and they demonstrably lack sensitivity to tail events, the very occurrences that are most pivotal in real-world decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). By leveraging the signature kernel, these metrics capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and remain robust to missing data. Furthermore, CSig-MMD introduces a censoring scheme that prioritizes a forecaster's capability to predict tail events while strictly maintaining properness, a vital property for a good scoring rule.

In the absence of noise, spin correlation functions exhibit a crossover from monotonic decay at fast sweep velocities to oscillatory behavior at slow sweeps. We show that, under a stochastically driven field, the critical sweep velocity at which the spin correlation functions undergo an abrupt change decreases with increasing noise strength and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. Remarkably, when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are comparable, the excitation probability becomes locked to pk = 1/2 over a finite momentum window, signaling the emergence of noise-induced maximally mixed modes. This gives rise to a highly oscillatory region in the dynamical phase diagram, whose threshold sweep velocity increases with noise and likewise exhibits quadratic scaling with the noise strength.

From this perspective, the physics penalty on the IBVP residuals can be better understood not as a regularizing term bus as an infinite source of indirect data, and the learning process as fitting the PINN distribution of residuals $p(y \\mid x, t, w) q(x, t) $ to the true data-generating distribution $\u03b4(0) q(x, t)$ by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and PINN distributions. Furthermore, this analysis show that physics-informed learning with PINNs is a singular learning problem, and we employ singular learning theory tools, namely the so-called Local Learning Coefficient (Lau et al., 2025) to analyze the estimates of PINN parameters obtained via stochastic optimization for a heat equation IBVP.

Here, we present a field-theoretic framework in which sensory adaptation emerges from a variational free-energy principle, formulated as a stochastic differential game between an organism and its environment. Using an Onsager--Machlup path-integral formalism, we show that the resulting adaptive dynamics are mathematically equivalent to a class of model reference adaptive control schemes and can be interpreted as a dynamic renormalization of the system's Green's function. Within this framework, the phasic overshoot commonly observed in sensory responses arises naturally from an effective inertia ($m^* \\approx \u03c4\u03b3$) generated by memory-dissipation coupling, rather than from biochemical fine-tuning.

It is based on a statistical ensemble of independent mean-field trajectories, where mean-field is introduced at the level of the qubits, substituting quantum fluctuations/correlations with classical ones. The approach only involves at worse a quadratic cost in the system size, allowing to simulate up to several thousands of qubits on a classical computer. It provides qualitatively accurate description of one-qubit observables evolutions, making it a useful reference in comparison to techniques limited to small qubit numbers.

In this paper, we investigate whether sensing and computation, two canonical tasks in quantum information processing, can be carried out within the ICO framework. We propose a scheme for integrated sensing and computation that uses the same quantum state for both tasks. The quantum state is represented as an agent that performs state observation and learns a function of the state to make predictions via a parametric model. Under an ICO operation, the agent experiences a superposition of orders, one in which it performs state observation and then executes the required computation steps, and another in which the agent carries out the computation first and then performs state observation. This is distinct from prevailing information processing and machine intelligence paradigms where information acquisition and learning follow a strict causal order, with the former always preceding the latter.

This picture can break down for multivalent electrolytes, where strong ion-urface correlations and charge inversion modify transport behavior.

By separating concentration and velocity contributions to the radial particle current density, we connect static adsorption to dynamic perm-selectivity. While NaCl exhibits conventional cation selectivity, CaCl$_2$ shows nearly bulk-like or even anion-favored transport due to Ca$^{2+}$ immobilization near the surface and dominant Cl$^-$ conduction in the pore interior following charge inversion.

Using a triangular lattice of three $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ ions, we optically pump selected ions into the long-lived $^2F_{7/2}$ state.

We characterize the metastable state lifetime in the presence of laser-driven ion-ion interactions, finding a deshelving rate that is orders of magnitude slower than the spin-spin interaction rate and scales quadratically with applied laser intensity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u79bb\u5b50\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e9a\u7a33\u6001\"\u6401\u7f6e\"\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u79bb\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u539f\u4f4d\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u6784", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u5b50\u6676\u683c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5e93\u4ed1\u65a5\u529b\u4e0e\u56da\u7981\u52bf\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u91cd\u6784", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528171Yb+\u79bb\u5b50\u4e09\u89d2\u6676\u683c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u6cf5\u6d66\u5c06\u7279\u5b9a\u79bb\u5b50\u7f6e\u5165\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u76842F7/2\u4e9a\u7a33\u6001\uff0c\u518d\u65bd\u52a0\u5168\u5c40Ising-like\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6401\u7f6e\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5b8c\u5168\u8131\u79bb\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4e9a\u7a33\u6001\u5bff\u547d\u6bd4\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6162\u6570\u4e2a\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u53bb\u6401\u7f6e\u901f\u7387\u4e0e\u6fc0\u5149\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848"}}

To this aim we derive nonlinear equations for the displacement field, including the consequences of plastic deformation on the mechanical response of amorphous solids. The plastic events collectively induce distributed dipoles that are responsible for screening effects and the creation of typical length-scales that are absent in classical elasticity theory. The nonlinear theory exposes an instability that results in the creation of shear bands. By solving the weakly nonlinear amplitude equation we present analytic expressions for the displacement fields that is associated with shear bands, explaining the role of the elastic moduli that determine the width of a shear band from ductile to brittle characteristics. We derive an energy functional whose Hessian possesses an eigenvalue that goes to zero at the shear-banding instability, providing a prediction for the critical value of the accumulated stress that results in an instability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u975e\u6676\u56fa\u4f53\u5728\u70ed\u673a\u68b0\u526a\u5207\u4e0b\u526a\u5207\u5e26\u5931\u7a33\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5851\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u63ed\u793a\u526a\u5207\u5e26\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e34\u754c\u5e94\u529b\u548c\u526a\u5207\u5e26\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u5f39\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u975e\u6676\u56fa\u4f53\u4e2d\u56e0\u5851\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u957f\u5ea6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u526a\u5207\u5e26\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u5305\u542b\u5851\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5931\u7a33\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u5305\u542b\u5851\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f4d\u79fb\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5851\u6027\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u63cf\u8ff0\u5c4f\u853d\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u632f\u5e45\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u526a\u5207\u5e26\u4f4d\u79fb\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u91cf\u6cdb\u51fd\u7684Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u526a\u5207\u5e26\u4f4d\u79fb\u573a\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f39\u6027\u6a21\u91cf\u5bf9\u526a\u5207\u5e26\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\uff08\u4ece\u97e7\u6027\u5230\u8106\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u91cf\u6cdb\u51fdHessian\u77e9\u9635\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u5e94\u529b\u5904\u8d8b\u4e8e\u96f6\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u526a\u5207\u5e26\u5931\u7a33\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u5e94\u529b\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6210\u529f\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u975e\u6676\u56fa\u4f53\u526a\u5207\u5e26\u5931\u7a33\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6750\u6599\u5931\u6548\u548c\u8c03\u63a7\u526a\u5207\u5e26\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u5f39\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "FOSS is a GFlowNets-based framework for span generation that constructs a dynamic span vocabulary and DAG-structured state space to enable diverse compositional path exploration, outperforming token-level baselines by significant margins on text generation and knowledge-intensive tasks.", "motivation": "Standard autoregressive language models have tree-structured state spaces that limit flexibility and expressiveness.

Such systems are shown to have their structure in thermodynamic equilibrium determined exactly by a random field of fine local descriptions and approximately by coarsenings thereof. The degree of order in the local cluster consisting of a particle and its neighbors is identified as a universal source of coarse local descriptions and characterized by expressing the behavior of configurational entropy in local microscopic terms. A local measure of the angular redundancy in neighboring particle positions is found to satisfy this characterization and thereby established as a valid local order quantifier. A precise relationship between order and symmetry is obtained by bounding this quantifier sharply from below by a simple function of the local point group and the largest stabilizer under its action on the set of bond pairs.

Existing approaches assume a symbol grounding function that maps high-dimensional states to consistent symbolic representations and a manually specified action masking techniques to constrain actions. In this paper, we propose Neuro-symbolic Action Masking (NSAM), a novel framework that automatically learn symbolic models, which are consistent with given domain constraints of high-dimensional states, in a minimally supervised manner during the DRL process. Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions. NSAM enables end-to-end integration of symbolic reasoning and deep policy optimization, where improvements in symbolic grounding and policy learning mutually reinforce each other.

A Benchmarking Framework for Multi-Hop Inference over Hybrid Knowledge", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with knowledge-intensive questions that require up-to-date information and multi-hop reasoning. Augmenting LLMs with hybrid external knowledge, such as unstructured text and structured knowledge graphs, offers a promising alternative to costly continual pretraining. As such, reliable evaluation of their retrieval and reasoning capabilities becomes critical. However, many existing benchmarks increasingly overlap with LLM pretraining data, which means answers or supporting knowledge may already be encoded in model parameters, making it difficult to distinguish genuine retrieval and reasoning from parametric recall. We introduce HybridRAG-Bench, a framework for constructing benchmarks to evaluate retrieval-intensive, multi-hop reasoning over hybrid knowledge. HybridRAG-Bench automatically couples unstructured text and structured knowledge graph representations derived from recent scientific literature on arXiv, and generates knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths. The framework supports flexible domain and time-frame selection, enabling contamination-aware and customizable evaluation as models and knowledge evolve. Experiments across three domains (artificial intelligence, governance and policy, and bioinformatics) demonstrate that HybridRAG-Bench rewards genuine retrieval and reasoning rather than parametric recall, offering a principled testbed for evaluating hybrid knowledge-augmented reasoning systems.

Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction.

In this work, we compare the accuracy of rank-r LoRA updates against full-parameter updates for fine-tuning tasks from a dynamical systems perspective. We perform gradient flow analysis in both full-rank and low-rank regimes to establish explicit relationships between rank and accuracy for two loss functions under LoRA. While gradient flow equations for LoRA are presented in prior work, we rigorously derive their form and show that they are identical for simultaneous and sequential LoRA parameter updates.

Robust quantum optimal control seeks error-insensitive control pulses that maintain fidelity thresholds and obey hardware constraints. Distinct numerical approximations to the first-order error susceptibility include adjoint end-point and toggling-frame approaches. Although theoretically equivalent, we provide a novel, systematic study demonstrating important numerical differences between these two approaches. We also introduce a critical discretization correction to the widely-used toggling-frame robustness estimator, measurably improving its estimate of first-order error susceptibility. We accomplish our study by positioning robustness as a first-class objective within direct, constrained optimal control.

Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHARPO\uff08\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u5e73\u8861\u8de8\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Omnisapiens-7B 2.0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534716.85%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5e73\u8861\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHeterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u5236\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u65bd\u52a0\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5e73\u8861\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Omnisapiens-7B 2.0\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7559\u51fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad816.85%\u548c9.37%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u660e\u786e\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002HARPO\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u5404\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u793e\u4f1a\u667a\u80fdAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

To that end, we collect a set of gradients obtained by backpropagating the differences between stochastic realizations of a fixed prompt that we later decompose into meaningful steering directions with either Principal Components Analysis or Sparse Autoencoder. Our approach yields three key contributions: (1) it isolates interpretable, steerable directions for precise, fine-grained control over a single concept; (2) it effectively mitigates mode collapse in distilled models by reintroducing lost diversity; and (3) it establishes a novel estimator for concept complexity under a specific model, based on the dimensionality of the discovered subspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u7f20\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u968f\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u64cd\u7eb5\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5355\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u56e0\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u5e95\u5c42\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u968f\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u5f97\u5230\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u53d6\u5f97\u4e09\u9879\u8d21\u732e\uff1a1) \u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5efa\u7acb\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65b0\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u7f20\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6982\u5ff5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

Hastings"], "title": "Accelerating Classical and Quantum Tensor PCA", "comment": "14 pages, 0 figures", "summary": "Spectral methods are a leading approach for tensor PCA with a ``spiked\" Gaussian tensor. The methods use the spectrum of a linear operator in a vector space with exponentially high dimension and in Ref. 1 it was shown that quantum algorithms could then lead to an exponential space saving as well as a quartic speedup over classical. Here we show how to accelerate both classical and quantum algorithms quadratically, while maintaining the same quartic separation between them. That is, our classical algorithm here is quadratically faster than the original classical algorithm, while the quantum algorithm is eigth-power faster than the original classical algorithm. We then give a further modification of the quantum algorithm, increasing its speedup over the modified classical algorithm to the sixth power. We only prove these speedups for detection, rather than recovery, but we give a strong plausibility argument that our algorithm achieves recovery also.\n  Note added: After this paper was prepared, A. Schmidhuber pointed out to me Ref. 3. This improves the best existing bounds on the spectral norm of a certain random operator. Because the norm of this operator enters into the runtime, with this improvement on the norm, we no longer have a provable polynomial speedup. Our results are phrased in terms of certain properties of the spectrum of this operator (not merely the largest eigenvalue but also the density of states). So, if these properties still hold, the speedup still holds. Rather than modify the paper, I have left it unchanged but added a section at the end discussing the needed property of density of states and considering for which problems (there are several problems for which this kind of quartic quantum speedup has been used and the techniques here will likely be applicable to several of them) the property is likely to hold.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u5f20\u91cfPCA\u7684\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8c\u6b21\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56db\u6b21\u65b9\u5206\u79bb\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u516b\u6b21\u65b9\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u672c\u66f4\u662f\u8fbe\u5230\u516d\u6b21\u65b9\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u4f46\u4e00\u4e2a\u540e\u7eed\u6587\u732e\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u52a0\u901f\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u9644\u52a0\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5f20\u91cfPCA\u5177\u6709\u56db\u6b21\u65b9\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u901f\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u6539\u8fdb\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6838\u5fc3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8c\u6b21\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u516b\u6b21\u65b9\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65b0\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u56db\u6b21\u65b9\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65b0\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u516d\u6b21\u65b9\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u4ec5\u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4ec5\u6709\u5408\u7406\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u8c31\u8303\u6570\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u72b6\u6001\u7b49\u9644\u52a0\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u6700\u540e\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u8d28\u5728\u54ea\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u52a0\u901f\u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

(7 pages of Suppl. Mat.)", "summary": "Processes controlled by stochastic synthesis and degradation (SSD) are widespread in biology but their reaction kinetics are not well understood. Using methods borrowed from the theory of resetting processes, we determine the first-passage properties of a collection of independent particles that are synthesized and degraded at constant rates, and follow an arbitrary diffusive process in space. At equal synthesis and degradation rates, the mean reaction time with a target site can be minimized as in stochastic resetting, and a $CV$-criterion is derived. When the degradation rate is held fixed and the synthesis costs are taken into account, an optimal synthesis rate is obtained.

However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions.

While classifier guidance is a standard approach for approximating this ratio and can succeed in general, we show it can fail to faithfully unlearn with finite samples when the forget set represents a sharp, concentrated data distribution. To address this, we introduce Temper-Then-Tilt Unlearning (T3-Unlearning), which freezes the base model and applies a two-step inference procedure: (i) tempering the base distribution to flatten high-confidence spikes, and (ii) tilting the tempered distribution using a lightweight classifier trained to distinguish retain from forget samples. Our theoretical analysis provides finite-sample guarantees linking the surrogate classifier's risk to unlearning error, proving that tempering is necessary to successfully unlearn for concentrated distributions.

The vertex functions $v_{n1}, v_{n2} $ are of the form $v_{n1}=\u03bbC_{n1} f(x), v_{n2}(x)=-\u03bb\\,C_{n2}m_{n}^{-2}\u03c9_{n}^{-2}f(x)$ where $C_{n1,2}$ are the coupling constants with the $n$th oscillator, $f(x)$ is any arbitrary function of $x$, and $\u03bb$ is a dimensionless constant. Employing the closed-time-path formalism the influence action $S_{IF}$ is calculated using a perturbative expansion in $\u03bb$. It is possible to identify the terms in $S_{IF}$ quadratic or higher in $\u0394(s)\\equiv f(x_{+}(s))-f(x_{-}(s))$ to constitute the noise kernel, while terms linear in $\u0394$ to that of the dissipation kernel. The non-Gaussian noise kernel gives rise to non-zero three-point correlation function of the corresponding stochastic force. The pathway presented here should be useful for the exploration of \\textit{non-Gaussian properties of systems nonlinearly coupled with their environments}; examples in early universe cosmology and in quantum optomechanics (QOM) are mentioned. A modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) is also established, which ensures the consistency of the model and the accuracy of results even at higher perturbative orders.

In this work, we extend Fokker--Planck Score Learning (FPSL) to efficiently reconstruct two-dimensional free-energy landscapes from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations using different types of collective variables. We show that explicitly modeling orthogonal degrees of freedom reveals insights hidden in one-dimensional projections at negligible computational overhead. Additionally, exploiting symmetries in the underlying landscape enhances reconstruction accuracy, while regularization techniques ensure numerical robustness in sparsely sampled regions. We validate our approach on three distinct systems: the conformational dynamics of alanine dipeptide, as well as coarse-grained and all-atom models of solute permeation through lipid bilayers. We demonstrate that, because FPSL learns a smooth score function rather than histogram-based densities, it overcomes the exponential scaling of grid-based methods, establishing it as a data-efficient and scalable tool for multidimensional free-energy estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06Fokker-Planck\u5206\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FPSL\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e8c\u7ef4\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7f29\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u751f\u7269\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6d89\u53ca\u5927\u91cf\u8026\u5408\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u7ef4\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u4f30\u7b97\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ef4\u5256\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55FPSL\u4ee5\u4ece\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4e8c\u7ef4\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u666f\u89c2\uff1b\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6b63\u4ea4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e95\u5c42\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u533a\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e19\u6c28\u9178\u4e8c\u80bd\u6784\u8c61\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee5\u53ca\u6eb6\u8d28\u901a\u8fc7\u8102\u8d28\u53cc\u5c42\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FPSL\u88ab\u786e\u7acb\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7ef4\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u4f30\u7b97\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

GenAI is expected to enhance cognitive systems by enabling personalized learning and streamlining educational services. However, stakeholders perceptions of GenAI in higher education remain divided, shaped by cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts. In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education.

Based on this insight, we propose Meta-Experience Learning (MEL), a novel framework that incorporates self-distilled meta-experience into the model's parametric memory. Building upon standard RLVR, we introduce an additional design that leverages the LLM's self-verification capability to conduct contrastive analysis on paired correct and incorrect trajectories, identify the precise bifurcation points where reasoning errors arise, and summarize them into generalizable meta-experience. The meta-experience is further internalized into the LLM's parametric memory by minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which induces a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories and facilitates effective knowledge reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that MEL achieves consistent improvements on benchmarks, yielding 3.92%--4.73% Pass@1 gains across varying model sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MEL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eceLLM\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u5185\u5316\u5230\u53c2\u6570\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3RLVR\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea64%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9519\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5185\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6RLVR\uff0c\u5f15\u5165LLM\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e/\u9519\u8bef\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5c94\u70b9\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u603b\u7ed3\u4e3a\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u5c06\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5185\u5316\u5230LLM\u53c2\u6570\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b03.92%-4.73%\u7684Pass@1\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "MEL\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86RLVR\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u9519\u8bef\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

There is a natural tradeoff whereby increasing privacy requirements may decrease the utility of a learning protocol. In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $\u0398((\\varepsilon \u03b2)^{-2})$, where $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $\u03b2$ is the accuracy tolerance.

This paper argues that neither of these views is correct, and that the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave is best understood as a collection of latent variables in the sense of a hidden Markov model, a construct that was not available when de Broglie and Bohm originally formulated what became their pilot-wave theory. This paper also discusses several other challenges for the ontological view of the pilot wave. One such challenge is due to Foldy-Wouthuysen gauge transformations, which connect up with the Deotto-Ghirardi ambiguity in the de Broglie-Bohm theory. Another challenge arises from the freedom to carry out canonical transformations in the wave function's own notion of phase space, as defined by Strocchi and Heslot.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper argues that the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave should be understood as latent variables (like in hidden Markov models) rather than as physical ontology or nomological/dynamical laws.

The effective Hamiltonian for microwave-optical (MO) squeezing is formulated via strong interactions in the microwave-intermediary-optical hybrid system, and based on which rigorous solutions for the dynamics of MO entanglement and quantum steering are derived analytically. Remarkably, it is found that stable MO quantum resources can survive in the unsteady evolution beyond the steady one, and the unsteady evolution can exhibit the enhanced quality over the limit of quantum resources in the steady-state case. Furthermore, the stable MO entanglement as well as one-way and two-way quantum steerings are efficiently controllable by modulating the effective coupling strength. The validity of our theory is demonstrated by applying it to the typical models of electro-optomechanical and cavity optomagnomechanical hybrid systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5fae\u6ce2-\u5149\u5b66\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u7a33\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4\u7a33\u6001\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u63a7\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u91cf\u5b50 steering\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5fae\u6ce2\u4e0e\u5149\u5b66\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u523b\u753b\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5fae\u6ce2-\u4e2d\u4ecb-\u5149\u5b66\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5fae\u6ce2-\u5149\u5b66\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u91cf\u5b50 steering \u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5fae\u6ce2-\u5149\u5b66\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u975e\u7a33\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u8fd8\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u7a33\u6001\u6781\u9650\uff1b\u7ea0\u7f20\u3001\u5355\u5411\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u91cf\u5b50 steering \u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7535\u5149\u673a\u68b0\u548c\u8154\u5149\u78c1\u673a\u68b0\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fae\u6ce2-\u5149\u5b66\u91cf\u5b50\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u64cd\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A Study of Cultural Novelty in Recipe Generation", "comment": "14 pages, 12 figures, conference", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \\textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u83dc\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\uff0cLLM\u65e0\u6cd5\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6587\u5316\u9002\u914d\u3002\u5176\u751f\u6210\u83dc\u8c31\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u8ddd\u79bb\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u6587\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u5b58\u8584\u5f31\uff0c\u5bf9\u521b\u9020\u529b/\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u98df\u6750\u7b49\u6587\u5316\u663e\u8457\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5176\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3001\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u53ca\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u4f7fLLM\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u6587\u5316\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u591a\u5143\u6587\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u70f9\u996a\u83dc\u8c31\u4e3a\u5207\u5165\u70b9\uff08\u6587\u5316\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0e\u521b\u9020\u529b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eGlobalFusion\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u6309\u6587\u5316\u8ddd\u79bb\u914d\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u83dc\u8c31\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u5bf9\u8ba9\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u751f\u6210\u6587\u5316\u9002\u914d\u83dc\u8c31\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u521b\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "LLM\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6587\u5316\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9002\u914d\u83dc\u8c31\uff1a1) \u751f\u6210\u83dc\u8c31\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u8ddd\u79bb\u65e0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b2) \u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u6587\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u5b58\u8584\u5f31\uff1b3) \u8bef\u89e3\u521b\u9020\u529b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6982\u5ff5\u800c\u5938\u5927\u65b0\u9896\u6027\uff1b4) \u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u9002\u914d\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u98df\u6750\u7b49\u6587\u5316\u663e\u8457\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c grounding\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u6587\u5316\u5bfc\u5411\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5bf9\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\uff09\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u8b66\u793a\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u6587\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

For structured generations with explicit segments and objectives, this couples unrelated reward signals across segments, leading to objective interference and misattributed credit. We propose Blockwise Advantage Estimation, a family of GRPO-compatible methods that assigns each objective its own advantage and applies it only to the tokens in the corresponding text block, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives. A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to a prefix-derived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling.

In this work we provide an explicit quantum circuit for block encoding a sparse matrix with a periodic diagonal structure. The proposed methodology is based on the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) framework and on an efficient unitary operator used to project the complex exponential at a frequency $\u03c9$ multiplied by the computational basis into its real and imaginary components. We demonstrate a distinct computational advantage with a $\\mathcal{O}(\\text{poly}(n))$ gate complexity, where $n$ is the number of qubits, in the worst-case scenario used for banded matrices, and $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ when dealing with a simple diagonal matrix, compared to the exponential scaling of general-purpose methods for dense matrices. Various applications for the presented methodology are discussed in the context of solving differential problems such as the advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) dynamics, using quantum algorithms with optimal scaling, e.g., quantum singular value transformation (QSVT).

A patient with a rare disease combination or a transaction with unusual characteristics stands out from the crowd. Differential privacy provides worst-case guarantees, but empirical attacks -- particularly membership inference -- succeed far more often against such outliers, especially under moderate privacy budgets and with auxiliary information.\n  This paper introduces risk-equalized DP synthesis, a framework that prioritizes protection for high-risk records by reducing their influence on the learned generator. The mechanism operates in two stages: first, a small privacy budget estimates each record's \"outlierness\"; second, a DP learning procedure weights each record inversely to its risk score. Under Gaussian mechanisms, a record's privacy loss is proportional to its influence on the output -- so deliberately shrinking outliers' contributions yields tighter per-instance privacy bounds for precisely those records that need them most.\n  We prove end-to-end DP guarantees via composition and derive closed-form per-record bounds for the synthesis stage (the scoring stage adds a uniform per-record term). Experiments on simulated data with controlled outlier injection show that risk-weighting substantially reduces membership inference success against high-outlierness records; ablations confirm that targeting -- not random downweighting -- drives the improvement. On real-world benchmarks (Breast Cancer, Adult, German Credit), gains are dataset-dependent, highlighting the interplay between scorer quality and synthesis pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u98ce\u9669\u5747\u8861\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u6761\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\"\u5f02\u5e38\u7a0b\u5ea6\"\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6309\u8bc4\u5206\u53cd\u6bd4\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e00\u89c6\u540c\u4ec1\uff0c\u4f46\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff08\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u4ea4\u6613\uff09\u5929\u751f\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u5145\u5206\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u62e5\u6709\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0d\u516c\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u98ce\u9669\u5747\u8861\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u6761\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\"\u5f02\u5e38\u7a0b\u5ea6\"\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6309\u8bc4\u5206\u53cd\u6bd4\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5f55\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bb0\u5f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9010\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9690\u79c1\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6ce8\u5165\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5f02\u5e38\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6539\u8fdb\u6e90\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u964d\u6743\u800c\u975e\u968f\u673a\u964d\u6743\u3002\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u3001Adult\u3001\u5fb7\u56fd\u4fe1\u7528\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u589e\u76ca\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u96c6\u6210\u5ea6\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u98ce\u9669\u5747\u8861\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u62a4\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u91cd\u65b0\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9632\u5fa1\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bc1\u660e\u9010\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9690\u79c1\u8fb9\u754c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6700\u9700\u8981\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6536\u7d27\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Already this initial work proposes society-relevant applications such as secure quantum banknotes, which can be exchanged between a bank and a customer. This quantum currency is based on various physical states that can be easily verified but is protected from being copied by the fundamental quantum laws. Four decades later, these ideas have flourished in the field of quantum information, and the concept of quantum banknotes has not only adopted many varying names, such as quantum money, quantum coins, quantum-digital payments, and quantum tokens, but also reached its first experimental demonstrations. In this perspective article, we discuss the current state-of-the-art of quantum tokens in the field of quantum information, as well as their future perspectives. We present a number of physical realizations of quantum tokens with integrated quantum memories and their applicability scenarios in detail.

In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC) in quantum batteries, showing that for qubits under amplitude damping, EMC depends on initial state coherence; anisotropic noise makes it depend on both coherence and energy; coherent ergotropy is crucial for qubits but not qutrits; non-Markovian dynamics creates multiple odd-numbered crossings; and qubit EMC implies state Mpemba crossing while qutrits break this correspondence.", "motivation": "To extend the counterintuitive quantum Mpemba effect to quantum energy storage by studying how ergotropy (extractable work) trajectories intersect, understanding its physical origins, and exploring how different noise types, system dimensions, and environmental memory affect this phenomenon.", "method": "Theoretical analysis of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with environments.

Derived EMC condition based on relative coherence for qubits under amplitude damping and fully characterized the EMC region. 2.

Non-Markovianity enhances the effect through multiple crossings. The relationship between EMC and state Mpemba crossing is dimension-dependent, revealing that higher-dimensional quantum batteries exhibit richer, more complex behavior that cannot be reduced to simple state-based Mpemba effects."}}

To generate recommendations, we compute the cosine similarity between student profiles and problem skill vectors, ranking exercises according to their alignment with each student's current abilities. We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings.

However, single kernel approaches are inherently limited, as they rely on a single type of kernel function (e.g., Gaussian kernel), which may be insufficient to fully represent the heterogeneity or multifaceted nature of real-world data. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) addresses these limitations by constructing composite kernels from simpler ones and integrating information from heterogeneous sources. Despite these advances, traditional MKL methods are primarily designed for continuous outcomes.

Using first-principles density-functional theory, we quantify its response to isotropic strain spanning strong compression and tensile regimes (effective hydrostatic pressures of approximately $-80$ to $180$~GPa). The coexistence of doubly degenerate $e_g$ and $e_u$ levels produces a structural instability captured by a quadratic product Jahn--Teller model. Under isotropic compression, the zero-phonon line blue-shifts nearly linearly while the $E_g$ phonon stiffens, suppressing vibronic instabilities and reducing Jahn--Teller quenching. Consequently, the Ham-reduced excited-state spin--orbit splitting increases substantially and the dark--bright vibronic gap widens. In contrast, isotropic tensile strain enhances vibronic effects and induces symmetry breaking beyond a critical strain, with tunneling-mediated dynamical averaging at the onset. Throughout the symmetry-preserving regime, parity remains well defined, so isotropic strain alone does not activate the dark transition. Charge-transition levels indicate photostability of the emission deep into the compressive regime, and near the highest photostable deformation ($\\sim 100$~GPa), the radiative lifetime increases due to a reduced transition dipole moment despite the increasing optical energy. These trends yield compact calibration relations linking optical and spin observables to isotropic strain and establish SiV$^{0}$ as a symmetry-protected, strain-tunable quantum emitter operating into the multi-megabar-equivalent regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7845\u7a7a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u5fc3(SiV\u2070)\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5e94\u53d8\u4e0b(-80\u81f3180 GPa)\u5c55\u73b0\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u4e0e\u81ea\u65cb\u7279\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff1a\u538b\u7f29\u5e94\u53d8\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u62c9\u4f38\u5e94\u53d8\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u7f3a\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5149\u5b66/\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u5e94\u53d8\u7684\u6807\u5b9a\u5173\u7cfb", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u6027\u7845\u7a7a\u4f4d(SiV\u2070)\u4e2d\u5fc3\u517c\u5177\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u53d1\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u6781\u7aef\u5e94\u53d8\u54cd\u5e94\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u91cf\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u591a\u5146\u5df4\u7b49\u6548\u538b\u529b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u6b21Jahn-Teller\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df-80\u81f3180 GPa\u7b49\u6548\u9759\u6c34\u538b\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u6548\u5e94", "result": "\u538b\u7f29\u5e94\u53d8\u4f7f\u96f6\u58f0\u5b50\u7ebf\u84dd\u79fb\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u3001E_g\u58f0\u5b50\u786c\u5316\u6291\u5236\u632f\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u3001\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u5206\u88c2\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5927\uff1b\u62c9\u4f38\u5e94\u53d8\u589e\u5f3a\u632f\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u503c\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u7f3a\uff1b\u5728~100 GPa\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\u5149\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e94\u53d8\u65f6\u8f90\u5c04\u5bff\u547d\u56e0\u8dc3\u8fc1\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u51cf\u5c0f\u800c\u589e\u52a0", "conclusion": "\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5e94\u53d8\u4e0d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6697\u6001\u8dc3\u8fc1\uff0cSiV\u2070\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u53ef\u8c03\u91cf\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u5149\u5b66/\u81ea\u65cb\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u4e0e\u5e94\u53d8\u7684\u6807\u5b9a\u5173\u7cfb\u4e3a\u591a\u5146\u5df4\u7ea7\u91cf\u5b50\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f9d\u636e"}}

Wagner", "Christian Tutschku", "Achim Kempf"], "title": "Experimental demonstration that qubits can be cloned at will, if encrypted with a single-use decryption key", "comment": "20 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "The no-cloning theorem forbids the creation of identical copies of qubits, thereby imposing strong limitations on quantum technologies. A recently-proposed protocol, encrypted cloning, showed, however, that the creation of perfect clones is theoretically possible - if the clones are simultaneously encrypted with a single-use decryption key. It has remained an open question, however, whether encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise and thus practical as a quantum primitive. This is nontrivial because spreading quantum information widely could dilute it until barely exceeding the noise level, leading to catastrophic fidelity decay. Given the complexity of hardware noise, theory and classical simulation are insufficient to settle this. Here, we settle this question experimentally, on IBM Heron-R2 superconducting processors using up to 154 qubits. We find that encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise, even when used as a module, namely in parallel, series or interleaved, while preserving pre-existing entanglement. This establishes it as a versatile quantum primitive for practical use, and it necessitates a refinement to our understanding of the no-cloning theorem: quantum information can be spread at will, in theory and in practice, without dilution or degradation, if encrypted or obscured.

However, a principled way of designing effective reward shaping functions, especially for complex continuous control problems, remains largely under-explained. In this work, we propose to automatically learn a reward shaping function for continuous control problems from offline datasets, potentially contaminated by unobserved confounding variables. Specifically, our method builds upon the recently proposed causal Bellman equation to learn a tight upper bound on the optimal state values, which is then used as the potentials in the Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) framework. Our proposed reward shaping algorithm is tested with Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) on multiple commonly used continuous control benchmarks and exhibits strong performance guarantees under unobserved confounders.

Building on an existing supervised tabular predictor, the framework constructs a reasoning-centric knowledge base composed of labeled tabular records, where each sample includes structured predictors, a compact natural language text-mode summary, and a model-generated reasoning trajectory. During inference, R2RAG-Flood issues context-augmented prompts that retrieve and condition on relevant reasoning trajectories from nearby geospatial neighbors and canonical class prototypes, enabling the large language model backbone to emulate and adapt prior reasoning rather than learn new task-specific parameters. Predictions follow a two-stage procedure that first determines property damage occurrence and then refines severity within a three-level Property Damage Extent categorization, with a conditional downgrade step to correct over-predicted severity. In a case study of Harris County, Texas at the 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale, the supervised tabular baseline trained directly on structured predictors achieves 0.714 overall accuracy and 0.859 damage class accuracy for medium and high damage classes. Across seven large language model backbones, R2RAG-Flood attains 0.613 to 0.668 overall accuracy and 0.757 to 0.896 damage class accuracy, approaching the supervised baseline while additionally producing a structured rationale for each prediction. Using a severity-per-cost efficiency metric derived from API pricing and GPU instance costs, lightweight R2RAG-Flood variants demonstrate substantially higher efficiency than both the supervised tabular baseline and larger language models, while requiring no task-specific training or fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "R2RAG-Flood\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u98ce\u66b4\u540e\u8d22\u4ea7\u635f\u5931\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u5730\u7406\u90bb\u8fd1\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u5178\u578b\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u6a21\u4eff\u4e13\u5bb6\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u98ce\u66b4\u540e\u8d22\u4ea7\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5fc3\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u63a8\u65ad\u65f6\u68c0\u7d22\u5730\u7406\u90bb\u8fd1\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5178\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u539f\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u5148\u5224\u65ad\u635f\u5931\u53d1\u751f\u518d\u7ec6\u5316\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff09\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u964d\u7ea7\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u6821\u6b63\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u54c8\u91cc\u65af\u53bf\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u73870.714\uff0cR2RAG-Flood\u8fbe\u52300.613-0.668\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c0.757-0.896\u635f\u5931\u7c7b\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7248\u5728API\u548cGPU\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u707e\u5bb3\u635f\u5931\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We present a compact framework that enables control of weakly coupled spin systems (of any spin), but using RF pulses optimised for a single spin-1/2. We do this by explicitly creating a GRAPE pulse with fixed 'active' evolution times using single spin-1/2 methods, and pulsing on one spin at a time. By enforcing this form uniformly across offsets ('band-schematic' pulses),chemical shift and scalar coupling evolution of the entire system can be precisely controlled. We demonstrate the approach by constructing band-schematic pulses and a continuously irradiated joint INEPT (JINEPT) that achieves band-selective transfer $I_z \\rightarrow 2I_zS_z$.

For example, while transformers capture rich associations, they are mostly agnostic to event timing and ordering, thereby bypassing potential causal reasoning.\n  Intuitively, we need a method capable of evaluating the \"degree of alignment\" among patient-specific trajectories and identifying their shared patterns, i.e., the significant events in a consistent sequence. This necessitates treating timing as a true \\emph{computable} dimension, allowing models to assign ``relative timestamps'' to candidate events beyond their observed physical times.\n  In this work, we introduce LITT, a novel Timing-Transformer architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual ``relative timeline'', thereby enabling \\emph{event-timing-focused attention} and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories. Its interpretability and effectiveness are validated on real-world longitudinal EHR data from 3,276 breast cancer patients to predict the onset timing of cardiotoxicity-induced heart disease. Furthermore, LITT outperforms both the benchmark and state-of-the-art survival analysis methods on public datasets, positioning it as a significant step forward for precision medicine in clinical AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLITT\u65b0\u578b\u65f6\u5e8fTransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u865a\u62df\u76f8\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u8f74\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u5e8f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e8f\u8d2f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u5fc3\u810f\u6bd2\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e8f\u8d2f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u7597\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709AI\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982transformer\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u5e8f\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u60a3\u8005\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u914d\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b9e\u9645\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u3002", "method": "LITT\u65f6\u5e8fTransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5728\u865a\u62df\"\u76f8\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u8f74\"\u4e0a\u4e34\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e8f\u8d2f\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u5e8f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u57283,276\u540d\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7eb5\u5411EHR\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc3\u810f\u6bd2\u6027\u6240\u81f4\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u53d1\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u51c6\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LITT\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6280\u672f\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u5e8f\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We show that higher-order harmonics driven by a coherent laser are squeezed and entangled. The properties of the emission are well retrieved with an entangled Gaussian state model, obtained by numerical state optimization to multiple observables. Additionally, we perform inter-order heralded measurements to engineer the quantum state of the emission. The heralded states have distinct properties, showing anti-bunched photon statistics.

While pre-trained large models have been hypothesized to contain similar knowledge due to extensive pre-training on vast amounts of internet scale data, using them directly in a search procedure is inefficient and inaccurate.

Effective specialisation requires learning new reaction knowledge while preserving general chemical understanding across related tasks. Here, we evaluate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for organic reaction prediction on limited, complex datasets. Using USPTO reaction classes and challenging C-H functionalisation reactions, we benchmark forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis and reagent prediction. LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full fine-tuning while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and better preserving multi-task performance. Both fine-tuning approaches generalise beyond training distributions, producing plausible alternative solvent predictions. Notably, C-H functionalisation fine-tuning reveals that LoRA and full fine-tuning encode subtly different reactivity patterns, suggesting more effective reaction-specific adaptation with LoRA.

Here, we improve it by introducing a Pareto Archive and dominated solutions substitution, clearly improving in hyper-volume convergence at additional quantum and classical cost. We propose the use of RMNK-landscapes as a unifying testbed for benchmarking QMOO, as it is common in classical multi-objective field. By devising a generic classical-to-quantum mapping of these landscapes, we perform a numerical hyperparameter tuning of QMOO, significantly enhancing its performance.

Existing UQ approaches for MLIPs are often limited by high computational cost or suboptimal performance. Evidential deep learning (EDL) provides a theoretically grounded single-model alternative that determines both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass. However, extending evidential formulations from scalar targets to vector-valued quantities such as atomic forces introduces substantial challenges, particularly in maintaining statistical self-consistency under rotational transformations. To address this, we propose \\textit{Equivariant Evidential Deep Learning for Interatomic Potentials} ($\\text{e}^2$IP), a backbone-agnostic framework that models atomic forces and their uncertainty jointly by representing uncertainty as a full $3\\times3$ symmetric positive definite covariance tensor that transforms equivariantly under rotations. Experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks show that $\\text{e}^2$IP provides a stronger accuracy-efficiency-reliability balance than the non-equivariant evidential baseline and the widely used ensemble method. It also achieves better data efficiency through the fully equivariant architecture while retaining single-model inference efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa e\u00b2IP \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 equivariant \u7684 3\u00d73 \u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5f20\u91cf\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u539f\u5b50\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 MLIPs \u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5c06\u8bc1\u636e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u6807\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u65cb\u8f6c\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7edf\u8ba1\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Equivariant Evidential Deep Learning for Interatomic Potentials (e\u00b2IP)\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u7684 3\u00d73 \u5bf9\u79f0\u6b63\u5b9a\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0e\u539f\u5b50\u529b\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u5b50\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0ce\u00b2IP \u6bd4\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u8bc1\u636e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u51c6\u786e-\u6548\u7387-\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5355\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "e\u00b2IP \u6846\u67b6\u4e3a MLIPs \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u7b49\u53d8\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

While recent works have further proven the universality of a (slightly generalized) model, the next immediate question pertains to its trainability, i.e., whether it suffers from the exponentially vanishing loss gradients, known as the barren plateau issue, preventing effective use, and how regimes of trainability overlap with regimes of possible quantum advantage. Here, we provide significant strides in these directions. To study the trainability at initialization, we analytically derive closed-form expressions for the variances of the partial derivatives of the MMD loss function and provide general upper and lower bounds. With uniform initialization, we show that barren plateaus depend on the generator set and the spectrum of the chosen kernel. We identify regimes in which low-weight-biased kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression in structured topologies. Also, we prove that a small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial scaling for the gradient under mild conditions. As for the potential quantum advantage, we further argue, based on previous complexity-theoretic arguments, that sparse IQP families can output a probability distribution family that is classically intractable, and that this distribution remains trainable at initialization at least at lower-weight frequencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86IQP-QCBM\u7684\u8d2b\u7620\u9ad8\u539f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faMMD\u635f\u5931\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u96c6\u548c\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u8c31\uff1b\u4f4e\u6743\u91cd\u504f\u7f6e\u6838\u548c\u5c0f\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\u65af\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u6291\u5236\uff1b\u7a00\u758fIQP\u65cf\u65e2\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7ecf\u5178\u96be\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53c8\u80fd\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76IQP-QCBM\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8d2b\u7620\u9ad8\u539f\u95ee\u9898\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u6548\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u533a\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfcMMD\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u504f\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u5747\u5300\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5668\u96c6\u548c\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u8c31\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "1. \u8d2b\u7620\u9ad8\u539f\u73b0\u8c61\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u96c6\u548c\u6240\u9009\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8c31\n2. \u4f4e\u6743\u91cd\u504f\u7f6e\u6838\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u62d3\u6251\u4e2d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u6291\u5236\n3. \u5c0f\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\u65af\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u786e\u4fdd\u68af\u5ea6\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7f29\u653e\n4. \u7a00\u758fIQP\u65cf\u53ef\u8f93\u51fa\u7ecf\u5178\u96be\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4f4e\u6743\u91cd\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u4ecd\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7406\u89e3IQP-QCBM\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u7c7b\u91cf\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, when applied to offline historical logs, these methods suffer a critical failure: the dominance of low-quality data induces severe model collapse. We first establish the Divergence Theory of Repulsive Optimization, revealing that negative gradient updates inherently trigger exponential intensity explosion during off-policy training. This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem. Guided by this formulation, we propose Distributionally Robust Policy Optimization (DRPO). We prove that hard filtering is the exact solution to this DRO objective, enabling DRPO to optimally recover high-quality behaviors while strictly discarding divergence-inducing noise.

While LLMs excel at processing unstructured text, graph tasks require reasoning over explicit structure, permutation invariance, and computationally complex relationships, creating a mismatch with the representations of text-based models. Our work investigates how LLMs can be effectively applied to graph problems despite these barriers. We introduce a human-interpretable structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation that injects graph structure directly into natural language prompts. Our method involves computing a variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) similarity classes and maps them to human-like color tokens rather than numeric labels.

Temporal fluctuations of energy relaxation in these qubits are widely attributed to microscopic two-level systems (TLSs) in device dielectrics and interfaces, yet isolating individual defects typically relies on tuning the qubit or the TLS into resonance. We demonstrate a novel spectroscopy method for fixed-frequency transmons based on multilevel relaxation: repeated preparation of the second excited state and simultaneous $T_1$ extraction of the first and second excited states reveals characteristic correlations in the decay rates of adjacent transitions. From these correlations we identify one or more dominant TLSs and reconstruct their frequency drift over time. Remarkably, we find that TLSs detuned by $\\gtrsim 100\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ from the qubit transition can still significantly influence relaxation.

As the set of design parameters grow, the search space grows exponentially, making the actual synthesis and evaluation of all material combinations virtually impossible. Even using traditional computational methods such as Finite Element Analysis becomes too computationally heavy to search the design space. Recent methods use machine learning (ML) surrogate models to more efficiently determine optimal material designs; unfortunately, these methods often (i) are notoriously difficult to interpret and (ii) under perform when the training data comes from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We suggest the use of tensor completion methods as an all-in-one approach for interpretability and predictions. We observe classical tensor methods are able to compete with traditional ML in predictions, with the added benefit of their interpretable tensor factors (which are given completely for free, as a result of the prediction). In our experiments, we are able to rediscover physical phenomena via the tensor factors, indicating that our predictions are aligned with the true underlying physics of the problem. This also means these tensor factors could be used by experimentalists to identify potentially novel patterns, given we are able to rediscover existing ones. We also study the effects of both types of surrogate models when we encounter training data from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We observe more specialized tensor methods that can give better generalization in these non-uniforms sampling scenarios. We find the best generalization comes from a tensor model, which is able to improve upon the baseline ML methods by up to 5% on aggregate $R^2$, and halve the error in some out of distribution regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes tensor completion as an interpretable surrogate model for material design optimization, outperforming ML in non-uniform data scenarios while rediscovering physical phenomena via free tensor factors.", "motivation": "Material design parameter spaces grow exponentially, making exhaustive synthesis/computation (e.g., Finite Element Analysis) infeasible.

Our pipeline (i) recovers compact, reusable model structure from flat solver formulations, (ii) reverse-generates natural-language specifications explicitly tied to this recovered structure under a unified model--data separation format, and (iii) performs iterative semantic validation through expert review and human--LLM interaction with independent reconstruction checks. This yields 223 one-to-one reconstructions that preserve the mathematical content of the original instances while enabling realistic natural-language-to-optimization evaluation. Experiments show substantial performance degradation on MIPLIB-NL for systems that perform strongly on existing benchmarks, exposing failure modes invisible at toy scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMIPLIB-NL\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4eceMIPLIB 2017\u6784\u5efa223\u4e2a\u5e26\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524dLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u52a3\u4e8e\u73a9\u5177\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u73a9\u5177\u7ea7\u6216\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u5de5\u4e1a\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u542b10^3-10^6\u53d8\u91cf/\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9f50\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u8303\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b/\u6c42\u89e3\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u53cd\u5411\u6784\u5efa\uff1a(i)\u4ece\u5e73\u5c42\u6c42\u89e3\u516c\u5f0f\u6062\u590d\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c(ii)\u5728\u6a21\u578b-\u6570\u636e\u5206\u79bb\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u53cd\u5411\u751f\u6210\u5173\u8054\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u8303\uff0c(iii)\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5ba1\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b-LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86223\u4e2a\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u5b66\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4e00\u4e00\u5bf9\u5e94\u91cd\u5efa\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728MIPLIB-NL\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "MIPLIB-NL\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u73a9\u5177\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u63a8\u52a8\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We revisit this assumption for pre-norm Transformers and ask to what extent sample-dependent normalization is needed inside Transformer blocks. We introduce TaperNorm, a drop-in replacement for RMSNorm/LayerNorm that behaves exactly like the standard normalizer early in training and then smoothly tapers to a learned sample-independent linear/affine map. A single global gate is held at $g{=}1$ during gate warmup, used to calibrate the scaling branch via EMAs, and then cosine-decayed to $g{=}0$, at which point per-token statistics vanish and the resulting fixed scalings can be folded into adjacent linear projections. Our theoretical and empirical results isolate scale anchoring as the key role played by output normalization: as a (near) $0$-homogeneous map it removes radial gradients at the output, whereas without such an anchor cross-entropy encourages unbounded logit growth (``logit chasing''). We further show that a simple fixed-target auxiliary loss on the pre-logit residual-stream scale provides an explicit alternative anchor and can aid removal of the final normalization layer. Empirically, TaperNorm matches normalized baselines under identical setups while eliminating per-token statistics and enabling these layers to be folded into adjacent linear projections at inference. On an efficiency microbenchmark, folding internal scalings yields up to $1.22\\times$ higher throughput in last-token logits mode.

Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faLatentRxnFlow\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5c06\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301SOTA\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u7406\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u5f0f\u4e00\u6b65\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u53cd\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u800c\u5206\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u673a\u7406\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u7b26\u53f7\u7f16\u8f91\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLatentRxnFlow\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u53cd\u5e94\u7269-\u4ea7\u7269\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4ea7\u7269\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u673a\u7406\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u4e2d\u95f4\u6001\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728USPTO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u66b4\u9732\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bca\u65ad\uff1b\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u8868\u5f81\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u51cf\u8f7b\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u5185\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u6807\u8bb0\u6a21\u7cca\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "LatentRxnFlow\u5c06\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u5411\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u53d1\u73b0\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u8fc8\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Dhillon"], "title": "LUCID: Attention with Preconditioned Representations", "comment": null, "summary": "Softmax-based dot-product attention is a cornerstone of Transformer architectures, enabling remarkable capabilities such as in-context learning. However, as context lengths increase, a fundamental limitation of the softmax function emerges: it tends to diffuse probability mass to irrelevant tokens degrading performance in long-sequence scenarios. Furthermore, attempts to sharpen focus by lowering softmax temperature hinder learnability due to vanishing gradients. We introduce LUCID Attention, an architectural modification that applies a preconditioner to the attention probabilities. This preconditioner, derived from exponentiated key-key similarities, minimizes overlap between the keys in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, thus allowing the query to focus on important keys among large number of keys accurately with same computational complexity as standard attention. Additionally, LUCID's preconditioning-based approach to retrieval bypasses the need for low temperature and the learnability problems associated with it.

Existing methods attempt to reduce distributional shifts by aligning manually selected graph elements (e.g., node attributes or structural statistics), which typically require manually designed graph filters to extract relevant features before alignment. However, such approaches are inflexible: they rely on scenario-specific heuristics, and struggle when dominant discrepancies vary across transfer scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets and 16 transfer tasks show that ADAlign not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also achieves efficiency gains with lower memory usage and faster training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faADAlign\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u8c31\u5dee\u5f02\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5bf9\u9f50\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u56fe\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faADAlign\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u8c31\u5dee\u5f02(NSD)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u8c31\u57df\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5f81-\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9891\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4ee5\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u8303\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5f3a\u8c03\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u8c31\u6210\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c16\u4e2a\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cADAlign\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "ADAlign\u4e3a\u56fe\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold.

However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings.

In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error).

Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "QTALE\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86token-adaptive\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u6267\u884c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728CommonsenseQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5c06\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\u63a7\u5236\u57280.5%\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\uff0ctoken-adaptive\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u662f\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u5355\u96c6\u6210\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3atoken-adaptive\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQTALE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u671f\u95f4\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff1b2\uff09\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u6267\u884c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eQTALE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86token-adaptive\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u5728CommonsenseQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4ec5\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u4fdd\u6301\u57280.5%\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "QTALE\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408token-adaptive\u6267\u884c\uff08\u964d\u4f4eFLOPs\uff09\u548c\u91cf\u5316\uff08\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent approaches have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate equation hypotheses, capitalizing on their vast pre-trained scientific priors. However, existing frameworks predominantly treat the LLM as a static generator, relying on prompt-level guidance to steer exploration. This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions. In this work, we propose PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization), a unified framework that evolves the LLM into an adaptive generator via reinforcement learning. Central to PiT-PO is a dual-constraint mechanism that rigorously enforces hierarchical physical validity while simultaneously applying fine-grained, token-level penalties to suppress redundant structures. Consequently, PiT-PO aligns LLM to produce equations that are both scientifically consistent and structurally parsimonious.

However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.\n  In this paper, we propose \\emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions.

While deep GLAD methods have shown promising performance, their black-box nature limits their reliability and deployment in real-world applications. Although some recent methods have made attempts to provide explanations for anomaly detection results, they either provide explanations without referencing normal graphs, or rely on abstract latent vectors as prototypes rather than concrete graphs from the dataset. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies.

Mitchell", "Chao Wang"], "title": "Analyzing Fairness of Neural Network Prediction via Counterfactual Dataset Generation", "comment": "Presented at NLDL 2026", "summary": "Interpreting the inference-time behavior of deep neural networks remains a challenging problem. Existing approaches to counterfactual explanation typically ask: What is the closest alternative input that would alter the model's prediction in a desired way? In contrast, we explore counterfactual datasets. Rather than perturbing the input, our method efficiently finds the closest alternative training dataset, one that differs from the original dataset by changing a few labels. Training a new model on this altered dataset can then lead to a different prediction of a given test instance. This perspective provides a new way to assess fairness by directly analyzing the influence of label bias on training and inference. Our approach can be characterized as probing whether a given prediction depends on biased labels. Since exhaustively enumerating all possible alternate datasets is infeasible, we develop analysis techniques that trace how bias in the training data may propagate through the learning algorithm to the trained network. Our method heuristically ranks and modifies the labels of a bounded number of training examples to construct a counterfactual dataset, retrains the model, and checks whether its prediction on a chosen test case changes.

A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes FIRE, a novel inference-time approach to neutralize backdoor attacks on neural networks by reverse-applying the backdoor's latent space directions to repair poisoned inputs during inference.", "motivation": "Backdoored neural networks pose a serious security threat as they can be manipulated through triggers, but existing defenses are ineffective for already deployed models because they require retraining, data filtering, or expensive input modifications.", "method": "The authors hypothesize that triggers create structured, repeatable changes in internal representations, which manifest as specific directions in latent spaces between layers.

This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks.

In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory.\n  Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.\n  Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.\n  We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds. Notably, models that violate the stability bound exhibit attention collapse and long-range degradation, while attempts to scale beyond one million tokens encounter a hard precision wall independent of architecture or training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801(RoPE)\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5176\u57fa\u7840\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff08\u6df7\u53e0\u754c\u9650\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u754c\u9650\uff09\u548c\u4e0a\u754c\uff08\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587Transformer\u7684\"\u9002\u5c45\u5e26\"\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801(RoPE)\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u884c\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06RoPE\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u590d\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u57fa\u7840\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff08\u6df7\u53e0\u754c\u9650\u3001\u4f4e\u9891\u76f8\u4f4d\u6f02\u79fb\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6df1\u5c42Transformer\u5206\u6790\u5c42\u95f4\u7d2f\u79ef\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\"\u9002\u5c45\u5e26\"\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLaMA\u3001Mistral\u3001DeepSeek\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fdd\u53cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u754c\u9650\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4e14\u8d85\u8fc7\u767e\u4e07token\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u903e\u8d8a\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5899\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86RoPE\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684fundamental\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9ece\u66fc\u51e0\u4f55\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u4ece\u5916\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u8f6c\u5411\u5185\u8574\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u7ef4\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u975e\u6b27\u7ed3\u6784\u4e14\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u9ece\u66fc\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5916\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5185\u8574\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u9ece\u66fc\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4ece\u6d41\u5f62\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u7406\u8bba\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ece\u66fc\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u52fe\u52d2\u51fa\u6db5\u76d6\u6d41\u5f62\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ee5\u9ece\u66fc\u51e0\u4f55\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u4ece\u6280\u672f\u5806\u780c\u8f6c\u5411\u7edf\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u5bf9\u5185\u8574\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\\% of the original model's performance at 30\\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B.

Clinical EEG recordings exceed LLM context windows, requiring extreme compression (400:1+ ratios) that destroys fine-grained temporal precision. A 0.5 Hz error distinguishes absence epilepsy from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. LLMs lack inherent time-series comprehension and rely on statistical associations from compressed representations. This dual limitation causes systems to hallucinate clinically incorrect measurement values.\n  We separate measurement extraction from text generation. Our hybrid architecture computes exact clinical values via signal processing before compression, employs a cross-modal bridge for EEG-to-language translation, and uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning with constrained decoding around frozen slots.

In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOSIL\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a8\u65ad\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5728CMDP\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u5b89\u5168\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u6536\u96c6\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u9690\u5f0f\u4f20\u8fbe\u5e94\u907f\u514d\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a", "method": "\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aCMDP\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u975e\u504f\u597d\u884c\u4e3a\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u4ece\u975e\u504f\u597d\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u5b89\u5168\u6027", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4ece\u79bb\u7ebf\u6f14\u793a\u5c31\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u884c\u4e3a"}}

Clustering behavior-datapoint similarity matrices also enables unsupervised discovery of emergent behaviors. Applying this to OLMo 2's production DPO training, we surfaced distractor-triggered compliance: a harmful behavior where the model complies with dangerous requests when benign formatting instructions are appended. Filtering top-ranked datapoints reduces this behavior by 63% while switching their labels achieves 78%.

We derive our bounds for SDual-Gap$_T$~and DSP-Reg$_T$~under strong convexity-strong concavity and a min-max notion of exponential concavity (min-max EC), and in addition we establish a class of functions satisfying min-max EC~that captures a two-player variant of the classic portfolio selection problem. Finally, for a dynamic notion of regret compatible with individual regrets, we derive bounds under a two-sided Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz (PL) condition.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper studies online min-max optimization beyond convex-concave settings, finding that static Nash equilibrium is incompatible with individual regrets.

However, practical offline datasets often contain examples with little diversity or limited exploration of the environment, and from multiple behavior policies with diverse expertise levels. Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \\textit{Q} or \\textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset. Results from experiments on the MuJoCo, Fetch, and AdroitHand environments show the correctness of the proposed LP form and the potential of the flexible $f$-divergence in improving performance for learning from a challenging dataset when applied to a compatible constrained optimization algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ef-\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6570\u636e\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u65f6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728Q/V\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u7ea6\u675f\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5f62\u5f0f\u5efa\u7acbf-\u6563\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7075\u6d3bf-\u6563\u5ea6\u516c\u5f0f", "result": "\u5728MuJoCo\u3001Fetch\u548cAdroitHand\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LP\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7075\u6d3bf-\u6563\u5ea6\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6f5c\u529b", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86RL\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

McIlraith", "Roger Grosse"], "title": "Gauss-Newton Unlearning for the LLM Era", "comment": "18 pages", "summary": "Standard large language model training can create models that produce outputs their trainer deems unacceptable in deployment. The probability of these outputs can be reduced using methods such as LLM unlearning. However, unlearning a set of data (called the forget set) can degrade model performance on other distributions where the trainer wants to retain the model's behavior. To improve this trade-off, we demonstrate that using the forget set to compute only a few uphill Gauss-Newton steps provides a conceptually simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach for LLMs. While Gauss-Newton steps adapt Newton's method to non-linear models, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately compute such steps for LLMs. Hence, our approach crucially relies on parametric Hessian approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). We call this combined approach K-FADE (K-FAC for Distribution Erasure). Our evaluation on the WMDP and ToFU benchmarks demonstrates that K-FADE suppresses outputs from the forget set and approximates, in output space, the results of retraining without the forget set. Critically, our method does this while altering the outputs on the retain set less than previous methods. This is because K-FADE transforms a constraint on the model's outputs across the entire retain set into a constraint on the model's weights, allowing the algorithm to minimally change the model's behavior on the retain set at each step. Moreover, the unlearning updates computed by K-FADE can be reapplied later if the model undergoes further training, allowing unlearning to be cheaply maintained.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faK-FADE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7K-FAC\u8fd1\u4f3cHessian\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u65af-\u725b\u987f\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u9ad8\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\u4e14\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u5584\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb", "method": "\u63d0\u51faK-FADE\uff1a\u5229\u7528K-FAC\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u5316Hessian\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u65af-\u725b\u987f\u6b65\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5c06\u5168\u91cf\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "\u5728WMDP\u548cToFU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cK-FADE\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u903c\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6539\u53d8\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u590d\u7528\u4ee5\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7ef4\u6301\u9057\u5fd8\u72b6\u6001", "conclusion": "K-FADE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u5ff5\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LLM\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af-\u725b\u987f\u6b65\u4e0eHessian\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u64e6\u9664\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7ef4\u62a4"}}

However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5374\u901a\u8fc7\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u5236\u5b9a\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff09\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u503c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5bf9\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u503c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u2014\u2014\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u53cd\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u673a\u5236\u4e0a\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u8003\u8651\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u3002\u5355\u4e2a\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\uff09\u5728\u5851\u9020\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u53d1\u6325\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5f71\u54cd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

West", "YangQuan Chen"], "title": "When Gradient Clipping Becomes a Control Mechanism for Differential Privacy in Deep Learning", "comment": "This manuscript is under review in the Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence journal", "summary": "Privacy-preserving training on sensitive data commonly relies on differentially private stochastic optimization with gradient clipping and Gaussian noise. The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6837\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\u662f\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u5f53\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u5927\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u8c31\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5bf9\u6307\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u5c3e\u8c31\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u754c\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u5bf9\u6570\u57df\u4e2d\u4e58\u6cd5\u66f4\u65b0\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u9608\u503c\u66f4\u65b0\u89c6\u4e3a\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u63a7\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8c31\u8bca\u65ad\u88c1\u526a\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess $\\textit{Crystallized Intelligence}$, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks $\\textit{Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI)}$: the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce $\\textbf{GENIUS}$ ($\\textbf{GEN}$ Fluid $\\textbf{I}$ntelligence Eval$\\textbf{U}$ation $\\textbf{S}$uite). We formalize $\\textit{GFI}$ as a synthesis of three primitives. These include $\\textit{Inducing Implicit Patterns}$ (e.g., inferring personalized visual preferences), $\\textit{Executing Ad-hoc Constraints}$ (e.g., visualizing abstract metaphors), and $\\textit{Adapting to Contextual Knowledge}$ (e.g., simulating counter-intuitive physics). Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes. It demonstrates that deficits stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability.

To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $\u0394R := R_P(\\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|\u0394R|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation.

Accurate assessment is vital for adaptive learning, clinical monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. Physiological signals such as pupillometry and electroencephalography are established biomarkers of cognitive load, but their comparative utility and practical integration as lightweight, wearable monitoring solutions remain underexplored. EEG provides high temporal resolution of neural activity. Although non-invasive, it is technologically demanding and limited in wearability and cost due to its resource-intensive nature, whereas pupillometry is non-invasive, portable, and scalable. Existing studies often rely on deep learning models with limited interpretability and substantial computational expense. This study integrates feature-based and model-driven approaches to advance time-series analysis. Using the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset, this study investigates cognitive load classification from EEG and pupillometry. Feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features and classical machine learning models outperform deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks. The findings demonstrate that pupillometry alone can compete with EEG, serving as a portable and practical proxy for real-world applications. These results challenge the assumption that EEG is necessary for load detection, showing that pupil dynamics combined with interpretable models and SHAP based feature analysis provide physiologically meaningful insights.

Synthetic data produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models trained on real data is often seen as one possible solution to comply with privacy regulations. While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u800c\u6dfb\u52a0\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6548\u7528\u4e14\u65e0\u5b9e\u8d28\u9690\u79c1\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u5e38\u56e0\u60a3\u8005\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u800c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u540e\u5904\u7406\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6280\u672f\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5fc5\u4e0d\u53ef\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u65e2\u5b9a\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u533b\u9662\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528eICU\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9MIMIC-IV\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u53d1\u8d77\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u65e2\u5b9a\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u5143\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u65e0\u6548\uff1b\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6dfb\u52a0\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u4f1a\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u4f1a\u521b\u9020\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u65e0\u8bba\u91c7\u7528\u4f55\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4ecd\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\u3002"}}

The proposed metrics assess how synthetic data reproduces key temporal characteristics, categorized into marginal, covariance, individual-level and measurement structures. We show that strong marginal-level resemblance may conceal distortions in covariance and disruptions in individual-level trajectories. Temporal preservation is influenced by factors such as original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies, including binning, variable encoding and precision. Variables with sparse or highly irregular measurement times provide limited information for learning temporal dependencies, resulting in reduced resemblance between the synthetic and original data. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation; instead, a multidimensional evaluation across all characteristics provides a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality. Overall, the proposed metrics clarify how and why temporal structures are preserved or degraded, enabling more reliable evaluation and improvement of generative models and supporting the creation of temporally realistic synthetic longitudinal patient data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u591a\u7ef4\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8fb9\u9645\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u5355\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u8fb9\u9645\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u5173\u952e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\u3002\u4e3a\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u6307\u6807\u5206\u4e3a\u56db\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8fb9\u9645\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u9891\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u7bb1\u3001\u53d8\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7b49\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u5c42\u9762\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5931\u771f\u3002\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u7684\u5168\u8c8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u56db\u7c7b\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6307\u6807\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9610\u660e\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u9000\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u521b\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows. Our results demonstrate a generalizable paradigm: leveraging physical insight to transform high-dimensional, coupled optimization problems into simpler representations can enable rapid and robust automated tuning for consistent high performance while still retaining current optimization algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\"\u5927\u6d77\u635e\u9488\"\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\u89e3\u8026\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cd\u5411\u9000\u706b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u572812\u7ef4\u6676\u4f53\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u627e\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6BO\u3001TuRBO\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e14\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7fTurBO\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u5e38\u5e38\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u4eea\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u4f18\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u5e76\u4f7f\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u4e3b\u8981\u641c\u7d22\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u5411\u9000\u706b\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u7ef46\u6676\u4f53\u5206\u675f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u800c\u6807\u51c6BO\u3001TuRBO\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807BO\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\u662f\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u81ea\u7531\u7535\u5b50\u6fc0\u5149\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u4eea\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

These challenges include numerical heterogeneity arising from the decoupling of positional embeddings, misalignment of quantization scales in FP8 PV GEMM, and the need for optimized system-level support. In this paper, we introduce SnapMLA, an FP8 MLA decoding framework optimized to improve long-context efficiency through the following hardware-aware algorithm-kernel co-optimization techniques: (i) RoPE-Aware Per-Token KV Quantization, where the RoPE part is maintained in high precision, motivated by our comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous quantization sensitivity inherent to the MLA KV cache. Furthermore, per-token granularity is employed to align with the autoregressive decoding process and maintain quantization accuracy. (ii) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction, which resolves the misalignment of quantization scale in FP8 PV computation stemming from the shared KV structure of the MLA KV cache. (iii) End-to-End Dataflow Optimization, where we establish an efficient data read-and-write workflow using specialized kernels, ensuring efficient data flow and performance gains. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLA LLMs show that SnapMLA achieves up to a 1.91x improvement in throughput, with negligible risk of performance degradation in challenging long-context tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

For instance, in hyperparameter tuning, the validation accuracy of a model configuration (arm) typically increases with each training epoch. A defining characteristic of RMAB is em horizon-dependent optimality: unlike standard settings, the optimal strategy here shifts dramatically depending on the available budget $T$. This implies that knowledge of $T$ yields significantly greater utility in RMAB, empowering the learner to align its decision-making with this shifting optimality. However, the horizon-aware setting remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel CUmulative Reward Estimation UCB (CURE-UCB) that explicitly integrates the horizon. We provide a rigorous analysis establishing a new regret upper bound and prove that our method strictly outperforms horizon-agnostic strategies in structured environments like ``linear-then-flat'' instances.

Because each participant invests data and compute, clients need mechanisms to later prove the provenance of a jointly trained model. Model watermarking embeds a hidden signal in the weights, but naive approaches either do not scale with many clients as per-client watermarks dilute as $K$ grows, or give any individual client the ability to verify and potentially remove the watermark. We introduce $(t,K)$-threshold watermarking: clients collaboratively embed a shared watermark during training, while only coalitions of at least $t$ clients can reconstruct the watermark key and verify a suspect model. We secret-share the watermark key $\u03c4$ so that coalitions of fewer than $t$ clients cannot reconstruct it, and verification can be performed without revealing $\u03c4$ in the clear. We instantiate our protocol in the white-box setting and evaluate on image classification. Our watermark remains detectable at scale ($K=128$) with minimal accuracy loss and stays above the detection threshold ($z\\ge 4$) under attacks including adaptive fine-tuning using up to 20% of the training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd(t,K)-\u9608\u503c\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6e90\u8bc1\u660e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u79d8\u5bc6\u5171\u4eab\u6c34\u5370\u5bc6\u94a5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53ea\u6709\u81f3\u5c11t\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8054\u76df\u624d\u80fd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u65e2\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u9632\u6b62\u5355\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u79fb\u9664\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u5e76\u5728K=128\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2dK\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4f46\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5404\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u6295\u5165\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7b97\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u673a\u5236\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5355\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6c34\u5370\u968fK\u589e\u5927\u800c\u7a00\u91ca\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5141\u8bb8\u5355\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u6076\u610f\u79fb\u9664\u6c34\u5370\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa(t,K)-\u9608\u503c\u6c34\u5370\uff1a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u534f\u4f5c\u5d4c\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f53\u81f3\u5c11t\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u624d\u80fd\u91cd\u5efa\u5bc6\u94a5\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u79d8\u5bc6\u5171\u4eab\u6280\u672f\u4fdd\u62a4\u6c34\u5370\u5bc6\u94a5\u03c4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c11\u4e8et\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e14\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65e0\u9700\u66b4\u9732\u03c4\u660e\u6587\u3002\u5728\u767d\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728K=128\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u6c34\u5370\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u635f\u5931\u6781\u5c0f\u3002\u9762\u5bf9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u8fbe20%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u9608\u503c(z\u22654)\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u9608\u503c\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6e90\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u3002"}}

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers a straightforward way to inject domain knowledge but often degrades the model's generality. In contrast, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) preserves generality but fails to effectively assimilate hard samples that exceed the model's current reasoning level. Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution.

Lampert"], "title": "Adaptive Sampling for Private Worst-Case Group Optimization", "comment": "8 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Models trained by minimizing the average loss often fail to be accurate on small or hard-to-learn groups of the data. Various methods address this issue by optimizing a weighted objective that focuses on the worst-performing groups. However, this approach becomes problematic when learning with differential privacy, as unequal data weighting can result in inhomogeneous privacy guarantees, in particular weaker privacy for minority groups. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups. Comparing ASC to prior work, we show that it results in lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASC\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5404\u7ec4\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u5dee\u7ec4\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5e73\u5747\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c0f\u6837\u672c/\u96be\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u574f\u7ec4\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e2d\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0d\u5747\uff08\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u9690\u79c1\u66f4\u5f31\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faASC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u5404\u7ec4\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7387\uff08\u589e\u52a0\u96be\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709\u7ec4\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u969c\u4e00\u81f4", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u969c\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u3001\u6700\u5dee\u7ec4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u727a\u7272\u6574\u4f53\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "conclusion": "ASC\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e2d\u6700\u574f\u7ec4\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4e0d\u5747\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u5dee\u7fa4\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848"}}

We build an automatic pipeline to collect data, with human verification to ensure quality. The final dataset contains 7,659 physical scenarios with 334 human-verified examples as the test set. We evaluated 10 contemporary LLMs and found that even the strongest model achieves only a 21.5% pass rate, demonstrating the difficulty of the task.

A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence. This reveals that the burn-in phase of the RNN is an important tuning knob in its training, with significant impact on the performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting. In all experiments, we observe a strong influence of the burn-in phase on the training process, and proper tuning can lead to a reduction of the prediction error on the training and test data of more than 60% in some cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u622a\u65adBPTT\u8bad\u7ec3RNN\u65f6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8c03\u53c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u9002\u5f53\u8c03\u4f18\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e60%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6BPTT\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u622a\u65adBPTT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u6790", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5408\u7406\u8c03\u4f18\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u53ef\u4f7f\u8bad\u7ec3/\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8560%", "conclusion": "RNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u8c03\u53c2\u65cb\u94ae\uff0c\u5176\u5408\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u622a\u65adBPTT\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411"}}

To analyze whether such a bias is present in temporal attention mechanisms, we derive sensitivity bounds on the expected value of the Jacobian of a temporal attention layer.

Existing KE methods are largely designed for dense architectures, limiting their applicability to the increasingly prevalent sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models that underpin modern scalable LLMs. Although MoEs offer strong efficiency and capacity scaling, naively adapting dense-model editors is both computationally costly and prone to routing distribution shifts that undermine stability and consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce MoEEdit, the first routing-stable framework for parameter-modifying knowledge editing in MoE LLMs. Our method reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections that keep router inputs invariant and thereby suppress routing shifts. The resulting block-structured optimization is solved efficiently with a block coordinate descent (BCD) solver. Experiments show that MoEEdit attains state-of-the-art efficacy and generalization while preserving high specificity and routing stability, with superior compute and memory efficiency.

We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state. On three diverse workloads-terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding. TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TVCACHE\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u62a4\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u6811\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u957f\u524d\u7f00\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe70%\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\uff0c\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u964d\u4f4e6.9\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8017\u65f6\u6570\u79d2\u81f3\u6570\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4GPU\u7a7a\u95f2\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u6f14\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4f1a\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u7f13\u5b58\u590d\u7528\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u524d\u5e8f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "TVCACHE\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u6811\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u957f\u524d\u7f00\u5339\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u7f13\u5b58\u67e5\u627e\uff1a\u53ea\u6709\u5f53\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5de5\u5177\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u5df2\u6267\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\u5b8c\u5168\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u624d\u4f1a\u547d\u4e2d\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u4fdd\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff08\u7ec8\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u3001SQL\u751f\u6210\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cTVCACHE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe70%\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\uff0c\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a6.9\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u9020\u6210\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5956\u52b1\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "TVCACHE\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present Pram, the first ML-based method that leverages the reasoning power of multimodal language models (MLMs) for addressing the trade-off dilemma -- a great need of service providers. As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered \"agent\", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster).

Recent generative approaches, including diffusion models, show strong performance under hypervolume, yet their behavior under other established MOO metrics is less understood. We show that generative methods systematically underperform evolutionary alternatives with respect to other metrics, such as generational distance. We relate this failure mode to the offline-frontier shift, i.e., the displacement of the offline dataset from the Pareto front, which acts as a fundamental limitation in offline MOO. We argue that overcoming this limitation requires out-of-distribution sampling in objective space (via an integral probability metric) and empirically observe that generative methods remain conservatively close to the offline objective distribution. Our results position offline MOO as a distribution-shift--limited problem and provide a diagnostic lens for understanding when and why generative optimization methods fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u8d85\u4f53\u79ef\u6307\u6807\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e16\u4ee3\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\"\u79bb\u7ebf\u524d\u6cbf\u504f\u79fb\"\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd9\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\u5730\u505c\u7559\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u79bb\u7ebfMOO\u7684\u8d85\u4f53\u79ef\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u7ecf\u5178MOO\u6307\u6807\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u8ba4\u77e5\u76f2\u533a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u79bb\u7ebf\u524d\u6cbf\u504f\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u79ef\u5206\u6982\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e16\u4ee3\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u900a\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7a81\u7834\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u524d\u6cbf\u504f\u79fb\u6784\u6210\u6839\u672c\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7ebfMOO\u5e94\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u53d7\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5931\u6548\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u900f\u955c\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u5e03\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u6765\u514b\u670d\u524d\u6cbf\u504f\u79fb\u3002"}}

Policy optimization algorithms generate a number of responses for a given prompt and then effectively weight the corresponding gradients depending on the rewards. The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget. In low-success regimes, where informative responses are rare and response cost dominates, these optimal weights become asymmetric, upweighting low success probabilities and thereby accelerating effective-time convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes asymmetric prompt weighting in RL for LLMs, prioritizing hard prompts with near-zero success rates to accelerate training convergence, especially in from-scratch scenarios like R1-Zero.", "motivation": "Current RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, RLOO) underutilize hard prompts with low/zero success probability by downweighting them, limiting efficiency in training LLMs for reasoning tasks.", "method": "Introduces asymmetric prompt weighting that assigns higher weights to prompts with low empirical success rates.

Post-SFT RL shows less benefit due to already high initial accuracy.", "conclusion": "Optimal prompt weighting should be asymmetric in low-success scenarios to maximize training efficiency. This strategy is particularly impactful for RL from scratch where the model traverses wide accuracy ranges."}}
