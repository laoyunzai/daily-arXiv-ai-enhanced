*Tianjing Zhou,Nariya Uchida*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: 研究环形非局域耦合相位振子中从同步到嵌合态的转迁机制，揭示作为嵌合簇成核前驱的缺陷态动力学特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 嵌合态（同步与异步共存）的形成机理复杂，需要深入理解从同步态向嵌合态转迁过程中的中间态，特别是作为前驱的缺陷态的作用

Method: 在环形非局域耦合相位振子系统中，分析相位梯度剖面中的行波缺陷（以恒定速度传播），研究其特性如何随相位延迟α变化

Result: 缺陷态比例随α增加并在临界点α_c达到峰值（此时系统进入嵌合簇态）；缺陷传播速度、数量和宽度均随α增加；缺陷总空间范围对系统尺寸N具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 缺陷态是嵌合簇形成的关键前驱，该发现为理解受挫耦合振子中嵌合态的出现提供了新视角

Abstract: We investigate the transition from synchronized to chimera states in a ring of non-locally coupled phase oscillators. Our focus is on the intermediate defect states, where solitary waves in the phase gradient profile travel at a constant speed. These traveling defects serve as a dynamical precursor for the nucleation of chimera clusters. The fraction of samples exhibiting defect states increases with the phase delay $α$ and peaks at $α_{c}$, where the system crosses over to asynchronous states filled with chimera clusters. While the traveling speed, number, and width of these defects increase with $α$, the total spatial extent of the defects remains robust against the system size $N$. These results shed new light on the emergence of chimera states in frustrated coupled oscillators.

### [2] [Generalized Kramers-Wannier Self-Duality in Hopf-Ising Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10183)
*Da-Chuan Lu,Arkya Chatterjee,Nathanan Tantivasadakarn*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper generalizes the Kramers-Wannier duality in the 1+1d transverse-field Ising model using finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebras, establishing a unified framework for non-invertible symmetries beyond abelian groups through a generalized Ising model with anomaly-free Rep(H) symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending self-duality symmetries (like Kramers-Wannier) beyond gauging of abelian groups in tensor-product Hilbert spaces has been challenging; this work aims to create a generalized Ising model framework using Hopf algebras to unify non-invertible symmetries, dualities, and lattice realizations.

Method: Constructs a generalized 1+1d Ising model based on semisimple Hopf algebra H with anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry Rep(H); uses a non-(co)commutative ZX-calculus for diagrammatic formulation; when H is self-dual, builds a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality operator; specializes to Kac-Paljutkin algebra H₈ for numerical and lattice studies.

Result: Identifies 4 of 6 Rep(H₈)-symmetric gapped phases separated by Ising critical lines meeting at a multicritical point; realizes all 6 phases via H-comodule algebra formalism; shows the enlarged symmetry flows to a Z₂ extension of Rep(H) in the infrared.

Conclusion: Provides a unified Hopf-algebraic framework successfully generalizing non-invertible symmetries and dualities beyond abelian cases, with explicit lattice models realizing the predicted symmetric phases and phase structure.

Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier transformation of the 1+1d transverse-field Ising model exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and, at criticality, manifests as a non-invertible symmetry. Extending such self-duality symmetries beyond gauging of abelian groups in tensor-product Hilbert spaces has, however, remained challenging. In this work, we construct a generalized 1+1d Ising model based on a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra $H$ that enjoys an anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. We provide an intuitive diagrammatic formulation of both the Hamiltonian and the symmetry operators using a non-(co)commutative generalization of ZX-calculus built from Hopf-algebraic data. When $H$ is self-dual, we further construct a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality operator that exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and becomes a non-invertible symmetry at the self-dual point. This enlarged symmetry mixes with lattice translation and, in the infrared, flows to a weakly integral fusion category given by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. Specializing to the Kac-Paljutkin algebra $H_8$, the smallest self-dual Hopf algebra beyond abelian group algebras, we numerically study the phase diagram and identify four of the six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases, separated by Ising critical lines and meeting at a multicritical point. We also realize all six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases on the lattice via the $H$-comodule algebra formalism, in agreement with the module-category classification of $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$. Our results provide a unified Hopf-algebraic framework for non-invertible symmetries, dualities, and the tensor product lattice models that realize them.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究U(1)-格点规范理论中少数量子弦（闭合电场线）相互作用的物理机制，利用准一维体系的映射方法探索在二维体系中难以直接计算的奇异动力学、临界行为和低能物理。

Method: 将RK二聚体和自旋冰模型映射到三类量子链：1/2自旋XXZ链、自旋-1链和用矩形条带密铺描述的动力学约束费米子链；建立边界条件扭曲与电场弦横动量的对应关系，并映射Drude权重与弦单位长度质量的反比关系；采用DMRG模拟数值确定这些自旋链的相图。

Result: 发现了许多新特征：1）获得的自旋-1链在RK点具有连续简并基态族（类似布洛赫球），但无微观SU(2)对称性；2）论证了一个模型在远离RK点处存在稳定的朗道禁戒无能隙临界点，这令人惊讶，因为完整二维问题在RK点之外通常是带隙的；3）该模型还展现出大量局域守恒量导致希尔伯特空间碎片化，源于电场线之间的相消共振。

Conclusion: 自旋链映射技术为探索格点规范理论中的奇异动力学、反常临界性和低能物理提供了有效手段，揭示了许多二维完整问题中不明显的新颖量子现象。

Abstract: We study Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) dimer and spin ice models realizing $U(1)$-lattice gauge theories in a wide class of quasi-one-dimensional settings, which define a setup for the study of few quantum strings (closed electric field lines) interacting with themselves and each other. We discover a large collection of mappings of these models onto three quantum chains: the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a spin-1 chain, and a kinetically constrained fermion chain whose configurations are best described in terms of tilings of a rectangular strip. We show that the twist of boundary conditions in the chains maps onto the transverse momentum of the electric field string, and their Drude weight to the inverse of the string mass per unit length. We numerically determine the phase diagrams for these spin chains, employing DMRG simulations and find global similarities but also many interesting new features in comparison to the full 2D problems. For example, the spin-1 chain we obtain features a continuous family of degenerate ground states at its RK point analogous to a Bloch sphere, but without an underlying microscopic global $SU(2)$ symmetry. We also argue for the existence of a (stable) Landau-forbidden gapless critical point away from the RK point in one of the models we study using bosonization and numerics. This is surprising given that the full 2D problem is generically gapped away from the RK point. The same model also displays extensively many local conserved quantities which fragment the Hilbert space, arising as a consequence of destructive resonances between the electric field lines. Our findings highlight spin-chain mappings as a potent technique for the exploration of unusual dynamics, exotic criticality, and low-energy physics in lattice gauge theories.

Abstract: Topological spin textures are hallmark manifestations of competing interactions in magnetic matter. Their effective description by nonlinear field theories reflects an energetic frustration that destabilizes uniform order while selecting finite-size, topologically nontrivial configurations as stationary states. Among the most extreme realizations are atomically-sharp domain wall excitations, namely one-dimensional (1D) magnetic solitons, which represent the ultimate scaling limit of magnetic textures. Such solitons may emerge in magnetic systems where effective exchange interactions compete directly with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Here we show that the square-net rare earth compound EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ realizes a very susceptible regime where the magnetic anisotropy competes with highly frustrated exchange interactions stabilizing a rare ferrimagnetic $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ state that, under applied magnetic field, supports the formation of atomically-sharp soliton defects. We confirm the bulk response of the 1D magnetic solitons via magnetization and electrical transport measurements. We establish both the zero- and in-field $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ order via neutron diffraction, while magnetic force microscopy visualizes its real-space evolution into a stripe-like array. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the soliton, we relate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-driven exchange interactions and the magnetic anisotropy through density functional theory, and we construct an effective 1D $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$K$ model whose atomistic spin dynamics simulations reproduce the observed soliton states as a function of external field. Our results demonstrate that EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ hosts atomically-sharp, field-driven 1D magnetic solitons, providing a new platform for studying 1D topological excitations at the atomic length scale.

TL;DR: 本研究利用Hubbard模型和格林函数方法，在Hubbard-I平均场近似下求解强关联系统的超导机制，发现排斥相互作用下可通过电子动能介导形成超导态，且临界温度在强相互作用下呈现饱和现象。

Conclusion: 库仑排斥相互作用可驱动强关联系统产生超导性，其机制与动能项密切相关，且有限温度行为揭示强关联体系中量子相变的普适特征，为非常规超导研究提供新思路。

Abstract: The understanding of the mechanisms responsible for superconductivity in strongly correlated systems is an interesting and important subject in condensed matter physics. Several theoretical proposals were considered for these systems. The Coulomb interaction between electrons allow a new approach to study this problem. In this paper, we use a usual Hubbard model with a local repulsive interaction to describe a 2D system. The system of equations are solved using the Green's functions method, within a Hubbard-I mean field approximation, which allows to treat the strong interaction limit. We consider both cases of attractive and repulsive interactions and obtain the zero temperature phase diagram of the model. Our results show, in the repulsive case, the existence of a superconducting ground state mediated by the kinetic electronic energy and described by a non-local order parameter. A minimum value of the repulsive interaction $U_{min}$ is required to create a pairing state. At finite temperatures, for strong interactions, the critical temperature $T_c$ shows a saturation similar to the Bose-Einstein condensation observed for strong attractive interactions.

TL;DR: 通过高分辨率共振非弹性X射线散射发现，La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$中存在量子临界点(QCP)，其电荷关联长度呈现普适标度行为，临界指数ν=0.74±0.08，表明QCP属于O(4)对称性普适类，且因隐藏在超导穹顶下而具有强耗散特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铜酸盐超导体的复杂相图可能源于量子临界点，但该临界点被超导穹顶掩盖，缺乏决定性实验证据，阻碍了对铜酸盐超导机制的完整理解。

Method: 利用高分辨共振非弹性X射线散射技术，在La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$中系统测量了不同掺杂和温度下的动态电荷-电荷关联函数。

Result: 观测到量子临界标度行为：不同掺杂和温度下的逆关联长度坍缩到一条普适标度曲线上，获得临界指数ν=0.74±0.08，其正值确认了QCP的存在；该指数值暗示QCP涉及电荷密度波及其他有序态，属于O(4)对称性普适类。

Conclusion: 该量子临界点通过电荷密度波体现但涉及多重有序态，其O(4)普适类特征与哈伯德模型在填充时的微观SO(4)对称性相似；由于隐藏在超导态内部，QCP表现出强耗散特性，准粒子寿命极短，量子涨落相互交织。

Abstract: Progress toward a complete understanding of cuprate superconductors has been hindered by their intricate phase diagram, potentially linked to a quantum critical point (QCP). However, conclusive evidence for the QCP is lacking, as the presumed QCP is buried under the superconducting dome, disguising its presence. Here, we use high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to examine the dynamical charge-charge correlation in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and uncover the quantum critical scaling, a key feature required for a QCP. Specifically, \djh{we observed that the inverse correlation lengths for various dopings and temperatures collapsed onto a universal scaling curve, yielding a critical exponent $ν$ of $0.74 \pm 0.08$. The non-negativity of this exponent confirms the presence of a QCP. Remarkably, the value of $ν$ suggests that while the QCP is manifested through the charge-density wave, other orders also participate, such that the QCP appears to belong to the universality class characterized by the O(4) symmetry, reminiscent of the microscopic SO(4) symmetry in the Hubbard model at half-filling. Further analysis indicates that the QCP is highly dissipative with a short quasi-particle lifetime, reflecting the intertwined quantum fluctuations due to its being buried inside the superconducting state.

Result: 发现在绝缘态形成的特征长度尺度以下，超导和密度-密度关联是简并的，并且都表现出远超孤立1D超导层的近长程序；这些效应源于金属层在超导配对层中诱导的有效长程耦合；在Kondo系统中直接表现为中间尺度上的近长程磁序以及RKKY耦合的强重整化。

Conclusion: 预测的效应可通过准一维重费米子化合物（如CeCo₂Ga₈）的局域探针、原子链工程或超冷原子气体进行实验验证，为理解Kondo绝缘体和关联电子系统提供了新视角。

Abstract: The undoped Kondo necklace in 1D is a paradigmatic and well understood model of a Kondo insulator. This work performs the first large-scale study of the 1D Anderson-lattice underlying the Kondo necklace with quasi-exact numerical methods, comparing this with the perturbative effective 1D Kondo-necklace model derived from the former. This study is based on an exact mapping of the Anderson model to one of a superconducting pairing layer connected to a metallic reservoir which is valid in arbitrary spatial dimensions, thereby linking the previously disparate areas of reservoir-enhanced superconductivity, following Kivelson's pioneering proposals, and that of periodic Kondo-systems. Our work reveals that below the length-scales on which the insulating state sets in, which can be very large, superconducting and density-density correlations are degenerate and may both appear to approach an almost ordered state, to a degree that far exceeds that of any isolated 1D pairing layer with short-range interactions. We trace these effects to the effective extended-range coupling that the metallic layer mediates within the pairing layer. These results translate directly to the appearance of near-long-range magnetic order at intermediate scales in the Kondo-systems, and explain the strong renormalization of the RKKY-coupling that we effectively observe, in terms of the back-action of the pairing layer onto the metallic layer. The effects we predict could be tested either by local probes of quasi-1D heavy fermion compounds such as CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, in engineered chains of ad-atoms or in ultracold atomic gases.

### [8] [Noise-balanced multilevel on-the-fly sparse grid surrogates for coupling Monte Carlo models into continuum models with application to heterogeneous catalysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11006)
*Tobias Hülser,Sebastian Matera*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: A novel noise-balanced sparse grids interpolation method addresses computational challenges in multiscale simulations by controlling Monte Carlo sampling noise and mitigating the curse of dimensionality through a single hyperparameter, enabling efficient coupling of microscopic kinetic models with continuum reactor simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiscale simulations combining high-fidelity Monte Carlo models with continuum models face two critical issues: 1) Sampling noise in Monte Carlo data corrupts surrogate models despite high accuracy with noise-free data; 2) The 'curse of dimensionality' makes computations intractable when responses depend on many macro-variables.

Method: Proposes a noise-balanced sparse grids interpolation approach that quasi-optimally controls Monte Carlo sampling per data point to manage noise, combined with multilevel on-the-fly surrogate construction during simulation. Uses a single hyperparameter to govern all aspects of surrogate accuracy, convergence, and data accuracy requirements.

Result: Successfully demonstrated on heterogeneous catalysis examples coupling microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo models with macroscopic reactor simulations. Achieves computational efficiency, guaranteed convergence, and exceptional ease of use with minimal parameter tuning.

Conclusion: The method effectively resolves noise-induced surrogate corruption and dimensionality challenges in multiscale modeling, offering a practical, user-friendly solution for complex multi-scale simulations with proven applicability in chemical reactor design.

Abstract: Multiscale simulations utilizing high-fidelity, microscopic Monte Carlo models to provide the nonlinear response for continuum models can easily become computationally intractable. Surrogate models for the high-fidelity Monte Carlo models can overcome this but come with some challenges. One such challenges arise by the sampling noise in the underlying Monte Carlo data, which leads to uncontrolled errors possibly corrupting the surrogate even though it would be highly accurate in the case of noise-free data. Another challenge arises by the 'curse of dimensionality' when the response depends on many macro-variables. These points are addressed by a novel noise-balanced sparse grids interpolation approach which, in a quasi-optimal fashion, controls the amount of Monte Carlo sampling for each data point. The approach is complemented by a multilevel on-the-fly construction during the multiscale simulation. Besides its efficiency, a particularly appealing feature is the ease of use of the approach with only a single hyperparameter controlling the whole surrogate construction - from the surrogate's accuracy with guaranteed convergence to which data needs to be created with which accuracy. The approach is demonstrated on challenging examples from heterogeneous catalysis, coupling microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo models into macroscopic reactor simulations.

Motivation: 探索多体系统中集体效应如何随自由度N增加而持续，以及有限系统混沌行为与热力学极限之间的关系这一基础性问题

Method: 采用Vlasov无碰撞框架分析热力学极限，通过数值计算大范围N值下的最大Lyapunov指数，并运用非广延统计力学工具分析熵指数q的时间演化

Result: 发现：1) 相关强度量的涨落随N代数衰减；2) 最大Lyapunov指数随N代数衰减，证实混沌在热力学极限下被抑制；3) 熵指数q虽在中间时间可能出现q>1的瞬态值，但随观测时间增加系统性收敛于1

Conclusion: 有限N动力学在渐近意义下是强混沌的，先前报道的q>1值源于有限时间效应而非持续弱混沌相，支持平均场模型在N→∞时涌现可积性的理论预期

Abstract: Mean-field systems provide a natural framework in which collective effects persist as the number of degrees of freedom N increases, raising fundamental questions about the emergence of integrability and the nature of chaos in large but finite systems. We investigate the dynamical and statistical properties of a quartic mean-field Hamiltonian model, with particular emphasis on the relation between the thermodynamic limit and finite-size chaotic dynamics. We first analyze the thermodynamic limit of the model within the Vlasov collisionless framework and derive the corresponding self-consistent single-particle description. We identify the conditions under which the mean-field dynamics becomes effectively autonomous and show numerically that fluctuations of the relevant intensive quantities vanish algebraically with N, supporting the emergence of integrability as N goes to infinity. We then study the finite-N dynamics by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent over an exceptionally wide range of N, spanning several orders of magnitude. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponent decays algebraically with N, consistently with the suppression of chaos in the thermodynamic limit for mean-field Hamiltonian models. Using tools from non-extensive statistical mechanics, we further analyze the time evolution of the entropic index q and demonstrate that, although transient values q > 1 may appear at intermediate times, q systematically converges to unity as the observation time increases. This behavior indicates that the finite-N dynamics is strongly chaotic in the asymptotic regime and that previously reported q > 1 values for the present models originate from finite-time effects rather than from a persistent weakly chaotic phase.

TL;DR: A deterministic input layer design suppresses spurious modes in reservoir computing, doubling prediction horizon and achieving 100% success in Lyapunov spectrum estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reservoir Computing's autonomous operation suffers from instability and high sensitivity to random initialization, causing unreliable performance on chaotic dynamics.

Method: Identify spurious unstable/neutral modes as the root cause and introduce a deterministic input layer design that structurally suppresses these modes a priori.

Result: Doubles prediction horizon, dramatically improves robustness to initialization and noise, and achieves 100% success rate in full Lyapunov spectrum estimation across 50 random seeds.

Conclusion: Provides systematic explanation for RC failures and a concrete design guideline, advancing reservoir computing from heuristic tuning to a reliable modeling tool for complex systems.

Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC), a type of recurrent random neural network, is a powerful framework for modeling complex and chaotic dynamics. However, its autonomous (closed-loop) operation is often plagued by inherent instability. Moreover, performance is highly sensitive to the reservoir's random initialization, leading to vulnerability to noise and/or behaviour that bears no resemblance whatsoever to the target dynamical system. Here we identify a primary cause of this unreliability: the emergence of excessive, spurious unstable or neutral modes in the closed-loop dynamics. We introduce a simple deterministic input layer design principle that directly addresses this vulnerability by structurally suppressing the emergence of these spurious modes a priori (before training). Our approach dramatically improves robustness to both initialization sensitivity and internal noise, doubling the prediction horizon. Furthermore, we demonstrate on chaotic dynamical systems that this design enables robust estimation of the full Lyapunov spectrum (100\% success rate across 50 seeds), signifying that the autonomous RC faithfully emulates the essential properties of the target dynamical system. This work provides a systematic explanation for a common RC failure mode and offers a concrete design guideline, advancing RCs from heuristic trial-and-error tuning toward a reliable tool for modeling complex systems.

Abstract: We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ In particular, we use this to compute the permanents of DFT and Schur matrices far beyond the ranges hitherto known. On the experimental side, we present two new observations. First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,σ^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $α$-stable distribution with stability index $α\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $α=2$.
  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(γ(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[
  \perm(γ({\textstyle\frac12}))
  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. For the geodesic to the DFT matrix, the permanent recovers $10$--$40$ times above its valley minimum when $n$ is prime, but not when $n$ is composite -- a geodesic fingerprint of primality.

### [12] [Entanglement percolation in random quantum networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10189)
*Alessandro Romancino,Jordi Romero-Pallejà,G. Massimo Palma,Anna Sanpera*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper extends entanglement percolation theory to networks with non-uniform initial entanglement, revealing that quantum protocols underperform compared to classical ones when entanglement randomness exists, while classical percolation depends only on average entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world quantum networks exhibit randomness in initial entanglement between nodes, but existing percolation protocols assume uniform entanglement; this work addresses the gap by analyzing non-identical entanglement scenarios.

Method: Generalized entanglement percolation protocols to networks with random initial entanglement distributions, comparing classical and quantum percolation outcomes through theoretical analysis of topology and entanglement thresholds.

Result: For classical entanglement percolation, only the average initial entanglement determines percolation success; quantum protocols generally fail more frequently under randomness compared to uniform cases, despite identical average entanglement.

Conclusion: Quantum entanglement percolation is less robust to entanglement randomness than classical approaches, implying real quantum networks require additional strategies (e.g., error correction) to handle non-uniform resources.

Abstract: Entanglement percolation aims at generating maximal entanglement between any two nodes of a quantum network by utilizing strategies based solely on local operations and classical communication between the nodes. As it happens in classical percolation theory, the topology of the network is crucial, but also the entanglement shared between the nodes of the network. In a network of identically partially entangled states, the network topology determines the minimum entanglement needed for percolation. In this work, we generalize the protocol to scenarios where the initial entanglement shared between each two nodes of the network is not the same but has some randomness. In such cases, we find that for classical entanglement percolation, only the average initial entanglement is relevant. In contrast, the quantum entanglement percolation protocol generally performs worse under these more realistic conditions.

### [13] [Cosmological Expansion Induces Interference Between Communication and Entanglement Harvesting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10203)
*Matheus H. Zambianco,Adam Teixidó-Bonfill,Eduardo Martín-Martínez*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper reveals that rapid cosmic expansion can completely suppress entanglement for particle detectors that expand with the universe, due to destructive interference between two entanglement sources (direct communication and quantum field harvesting), while fixed-size detectors remain resilient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how cosmological expansion affects quantum entanglement acquisition is crucial for quantum information theory in relativistic settings, particularly for designing future quantum technologies in expanding universes where time-reversal symmetry is broken.

Method: Analyzed local particle detectors interacting with a conformally coupled scalar field in de Sitter spacetime, comparing two models: (1) detectors with spatially expanding profiles matching cosmic expansion, and (2) detectors maintaining fixed proper size. Studied interference between communication-mediated correlations and genuine entanglement harvesting when detectors are causally connected.

Result: Cosmological expansion induces time-asymmetric interference between entanglement sources. For expanding detectors, rapid expansion causes destructive interference that suppresses total entanglement to zero—even when individual communication and harvesting contributions are large. Fixed-size detectors avoid this suppression and retain significant entanglement. Time-reversal symmetry breaking generically determines interference outcomes (constructive/destructive).

Conclusion: Cosmological expansion fundamentally alters entanglement dynamics by enabling interference between distinct correlation sources. Detector internal cohesion (expansion behavior) is critical: expanding detectors cannot sustain entanglement in rapidly growing universes, while fixed-size detectors remain viable for quantum information tasks, reshaping expectations for entanglement harvesting in cosmology.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between genuine entanglement harvesting and communication mediated correlations for local particle detectors in expanding cosmological spacetimes. Focusing on a conformally coupled scalar field in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze how spacetime expansion induces interference between these two sources of entanglement when the detectors are in causal contact. We compare two physically distinct detector models: detectors whose spatial profile expands with the Universe, and detectors whose proper size remains fixed despite cosmological expansion. We find that the lack of time-reversal symmetry in cosmological settings generically leads to constructive or destructive interference between communication mediated correlations and harvested field correlations, dramatically affecting the entanglement that detectors can acquire. In particular, rapid expansion can suppress entanglement entirely for expanding detectors through destructive interference, even when both communication and field correlations are individually large, whereas detectors that maintain a fixed proper size remain capable of acquiring significant entanglement. Our results show that cosmological expansion qualitatively reshapes the balance between communication and harvesting, and that the detector internal cohesion (whether it expands with the Universe or not) plays a crucial role in determining whether detectors' entanglement can survive in rapidly expanding universes.

Conclusion: 建立了从信息论视角探索量子技术根本限制的新路径，为量子信息处理的基础研究提供新思路。

Abstract: Communication complexity, which quantifies the minimum communication required for distributed computation, offers a natural setting for investigating the capabilities and limitations of quantum mechanics in information processing. We introduce an information-theoretic approach to study one-way communication complexity based solely on the axioms of mutual information. Within this framework, we derive an extended statement of the information causality principle, which recovers known lower bounds on the communication complexities for a range of functions in a simplified manner and leads to new results. We further prove that the extended information causality principle is at least as strong as the principle of non-trivial communication complexity in bounding the strength of quantum correlations attainable in Bell experiments. Our study establishes a new route for exploring the fundamental limits of quantum technologies from an information-theoretic viewpoint.

*Christian de Correc,Denis Lacroix,Corentin Bertrand*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A phase-space mean-field approach enables simulation of thousands of qubits on classical computers with quadratic scaling, accurate for single-qubit observables but limited for multi-qubit ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating large-scale qubit systems on classical computers is computationally challenging due to exponential scaling of conventional quantum methods; there's a need for approximate methods that can handle thousands of qubits for benchmarking and comparison purposes.

Method: The authors develop a phase-space approach using an ensemble of independent mean-field trajectories, where quantum fluctuations are replaced by classical ones at the qubit level. This reduces computational cost to at most quadratic in system size.

Result: The method successfully simulates up to 2000 qubits in transverse-field Ising models across various regimes (local to all-to-all couplings, weak to strong coupling). It provides qualitatively accurate predictions for single-qubit observables but shows reduced robustness for multi-qubit observables.

Conclusion: This phase-space approach offers a valuable tool for simulating large qubit registers on classical computers, serving as a practical reference for methods limited to small systems, though its accuracy is primarily limited to single-qubit measurements.

Abstract: A phase-space approach is used and benchmarked for the simulation of the continuous-time evolution of large registers of qubits. It is based on a statistical ensemble of independent mean-field trajectories, where mean-field is introduced at the level of the qubits, substituting quantum fluctuations/correlations with classical ones. The approach only involves at worse a quadratic cost in the system size, allowing to simulate up to several thousands of qubits on a classical computer. It provides qualitatively accurate description of one-qubit observables evolutions, making it a useful reference in comparison to techniques limited to small qubit numbers. The predictive power is however less robust for multi-qubits observables. We benchmark the method on the $k$-local transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), considering a large variety of systems ranging from local to all-to-all interactions, and from weak to strong coupling regimes, with up to 2000 qubits. To showcase the versatility of the approach, simulations on 2D and 3D Ising models are also made.

Abstract: Quantum operations with indefinite causal order (ICO) represent a framework in quantum information processing where the relative order between two events can be indefinite. In this paper, we investigate whether sensing and computation, two canonical tasks in quantum information processing, can be carried out within the ICO framework. We propose a scheme for integrated sensing and computation that uses the same quantum state for both tasks. The quantum state is represented as an agent that performs state observation and learns a function of the state to make predictions via a parametric model. Under an ICO operation, the agent experiences a superposition of orders, one in which it performs state observation and then executes the required computation steps, and another in which the agent carries out the computation first and then performs state observation. This is distinct from prevailing information processing and machine intelligence paradigms where information acquisition and learning follow a strict causal order, with the former always preceding the latter. We provide experimental results and we show that the proposed scheme can achieve small training and testing losses on a representative task in magnetic navigation.

Abstract: Trapped-ion lattice geometries, which determine the interactions between trapped-ion qubits, are typically governed by the balance of Coulomb repulsion forces with the external trapping potential. Here we demonstrate how the effective ion lattice geometry and resulting qubit-qubit interactions may be reconfigured in-situ, by shelving specific ions in metastable states outside the qubit subspace. Using a triangular lattice of three $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ ions, we optically pump selected ions into the long-lived $^2F_{7/2}$ state. We then apply a global Ising-like Hamiltonian to the system and verify that the shelved qubits are fully removed from participation in the quantum dynamics. We characterize the metastable state lifetime in the presence of laser-driven ion-ion interactions, finding a deshelving rate that is orders of magnitude slower than the spin-spin interaction rate and scales quadratically with applied laser intensity.

Result: 1) 经典正则变换由非对易的厄米算符生成；2) 由此产生经典力学固有的不确定性关系（如位置与空间平移生成元、动量与动量平移生成元之间）；3) Wigner表示产生的准概率分布可取负值

Conclusion: 不确定性关系和负准概率分布这两个量子力学标志特征可在经典力学的希尔伯特空间表述中重现，表明这些特征并非量子力学独有

Abstract: Classical mechanics, in the Koopman-von Neumann formulation, is described in Hilbert space. It is shown here that classical canonical transformations are generated by Hermitian operators that are in general noncommutative. This naturally brings about uncertainty relations inherent in classical mechanics, for example between position and the generator of space translations, between momentum and the generator of momentum translations, and between dynamical time and the Liouvillian, to name a few. Further, it is shown that the Wigner representation produces a quasi-probability distribution that can take on negative values. Thus, two of the hallmark features of quantum mechanics are reproduced, and become apparent, in a Hilbert-space formulation of classical mechanics.

Abstract: Control pulses that nominally optimize fidelity are sensitive to routine hardware drift and modeling errors. Robust quantum optimal control seeks error-insensitive control pulses that maintain fidelity thresholds and obey hardware constraints. Distinct numerical approximations to the first-order error susceptibility include adjoint end-point and toggling-frame approaches. Although theoretically equivalent, we provide a novel, systematic study demonstrating important numerical differences between these two approaches. We also introduce a critical discretization correction to the widely-used toggling-frame robustness estimator, measurably improving its estimate of first-order error susceptibility. We accomplish our study by positioning robustness as a first-class objective within direct, constrained optimal control. Our approach uniquely handles control and fidelity constraints while cleanly isolating robustness for dedicated optimization. In both single- and two-qubit examples under realistic constraints, our approach provides an analytic edge for obtaining precise, physics-informed robustness.

Abstract: Spectral methods are a leading approach for tensor PCA with a ``spiked" Gaussian tensor. The methods use the spectrum of a linear operator in a vector space with exponentially high dimension and in Ref. 1 it was shown that quantum algorithms could then lead to an exponential space saving as well as a quartic speedup over classical. Here we show how to accelerate both classical and quantum algorithms quadratically, while maintaining the same quartic separation between them. That is, our classical algorithm here is quadratically faster than the original classical algorithm, while the quantum algorithm is eigth-power faster than the original classical algorithm. We then give a further modification of the quantum algorithm, increasing its speedup over the modified classical algorithm to the sixth power. We only prove these speedups for detection, rather than recovery, but we give a strong plausibility argument that our algorithm achieves recovery also.
  Note added: After this paper was prepared, A. Schmidhuber pointed out to me Ref. 3. This improves the best existing bounds on the spectral norm of a certain random operator. Because the norm of this operator enters into the runtime, with this improvement on the norm, we no longer have a provable polynomial speedup. Our results are phrased in terms of certain properties of the spectrum of this operator (not merely the largest eigenvalue but also the density of states). So, if these properties still hold, the speedup still holds. Rather than modify the paper, I have left it unchanged but added a section at the end discussing the needed property of density of states and considering for which problems (there are several problems for which this kind of quartic quantum speedup has been used and the techniques here will likely be applicable to several of them) the property is likely to hold.

Conclusion: 该理论框架有效描述了非线性耦合系统的非高斯统计特性，修正的FDR确保了物理一致性，推导的非线性朗之万方程具有广泛应用价值。研究成果特别适用于早期宇宙量子涨落和量子光力学系统等前沿领域，为探索复杂环境下的量子-经典过渡问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Building upon the work of Hu, Paz, and Zhang [1,2] on open quantum systems we consider the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model with one oscillator (position variable $x$) as the system, {\it nonlinearly} coupled to an environment of $N$ harmonic oscillators (with mass $m_n$, natural frequency $ω_n$, position $q_n$ and momentum $p_n$ variables) in the form $\sum_{n}\left(v_{n1}(x)q_{n}^{k}+v_{n2}(x)p_{n}^{l}\right)$ where $k, l$ are integers (the present work only considers the $k=l=2$ cases). The vertex functions $v_{n1}, v_{n2} $ are of the form $v_{n1}=λC_{n1} f(x), v_{n2}(x)=-λ\,C_{n2}m_{n}^{-2}ω_{n}^{-2}f(x)$ where $C_{n1,2}$ are the coupling constants with the $n$th oscillator, $f(x)$ is any arbitrary function of $x$, and $λ$ is a dimensionless constant. Employing the closed-time-path formalism the influence action $S_{IF}$ is calculated using a perturbative expansion in $λ$. It is possible to identify the terms in $S_{IF}$ quadratic or higher in $Δ(s)\equiv f(x_{+}(s))-f(x_{-}(s))$ to constitute the noise kernel, while terms linear in $Δ$ to that of the dissipation kernel. The non-Gaussian noise kernel gives rise to non-zero three-point correlation function of the corresponding stochastic force. The pathway presented here should be useful for the exploration of \textit{non-Gaussian properties of systems nonlinearly coupled with their environments}; examples in early universe cosmology and in quantum optomechanics (QOM) are mentioned. A modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) is also established, which ensures the consistency of the model and the accuracy of results even at higher perturbative orders. Another result of significance is the derivation of a nonlinear Langevin equation which is expected to be useful for many open quantum system applications.

Abstract: We construct 14 hyperbolic CSS surface codes from $\{8,3\}$, $\{10,3\}$, and $\{12,3\}$ tessellations and 11 semi-hyperbolic (fine-grained) codes. We simulate all 25 codes under circuit-level erasure and Pauli noise. Under circuit-level Pauli noise, pseudothresholds increase with code size within each family ($0.24$--$0.49\%$ for $\{8,3\}$, $0.11$--$0.43\%$ for $\{10,3\}$, $0.07$--$0.13\%$ for $\{12,3\}$). For erasure noise, most codes have $p^*_{\mathrm{E}} > 5\%$. Per-observable family thresholds give erasure-to-Pauli ratios of $2.7$--$3.9\times$ for the base code families. Fine-grained scaling families achieve higher thresholds in both Pauli ($0.67$--$0.68\%$) and erasure ($3.0$--$3.5\%$), with ratios of $4.5$--$5.2\times$. Under phenomenological noise, per-logical $Z$-channel thresholds are ${\sim}2\%$ for $\{8,3\}$ and ${\sim}1\%$ for $\{10,3\}$; the $\{12,3\}$ threshold lies below $0.5\%$.

In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\varepsilon,δ)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $Θ((\varepsilon β)^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $β$ is the accuracy tolerance. We conclude by initiating the study of private classical shadows, which promise useful applications for private learning tasks.

### [25] [Pilot-Wave Theories as Hidden Markov Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10569)
*Jacob A. Barandes*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper argues that the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave should be understood as latent variables (like in hidden Markov models) rather than as physical ontology or nomological/dynamical laws. It addresses challenges including Foldy-Wouthuysen gauge transformations, the Deotto-Ghirardi ambiguity, and canonical transformation freedom in wave function phase space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fundamental nature of the pilot wave in de Broglie-Bohm theory remains contested between two views: treating it as physical reality (ontology) or as mathematical law (nomology). The paper seeks to resolve this debate by introducing a more precise modern framework.

Method: Conceptual analysis that reframes the pilot wave using the modern statistical construct of latent variables from hidden Markov models, which was not available to the original theorists, to evaluate both ontological and nomological interpretations.

Result: The pilot wave is best characterized as a collection of latent variables—unobservable elements that mediate between underlying dynamics and observations—neither fully physical nor merely law-like, resolving interpretive ambiguities.

Conclusion: The latent variable interpretation provides a superior understanding of the pilot wave that avoids problems facing both the ontological and nomological views, particularly regarding gauge symmetry and theoretical ambiguity.

Abstract: The original version of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory, also called Bohmian mechanics, attempted to treat the wave function or pilot wave as a part of the physical ontology of nature. More recent versions of the de Broglie-Bohm theory appearing in the last few decades have tried to regard the pilot wave instead as an aspect of the theory's nomology, or dynamical laws. This paper argues that neither of these views is correct, and that the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave is best understood as a collection of latent variables in the sense of a hidden Markov model, a construct that was not available when de Broglie and Bohm originally formulated what became their pilot-wave theory. This paper also discusses several other challenges for the ontological view of the pilot wave. One such challenge is due to Foldy-Wouthuysen gauge transformations, which connect up with the Deotto-Ghirardi ambiguity in the de Broglie-Bohm theory. Another challenge arises from the freedom to carry out canonical transformations in the wave function's own notion of phase space, as defined by Strocchi and Heslot.

Conclusion: 该理论框架在电光机械和腔光磁机械混合系统中得到验证，为微波-光学量子接口和量子资源操控提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We develop a general theoretical framework for characterizing stable quantum resources between microwave and optical modes in the dynamics of multipartite hybrid quantum systems with intermediary modes. The effective Hamiltonian for microwave-optical (MO) squeezing is formulated via strong interactions in the microwave-intermediary-optical hybrid system, and based on which rigorous solutions for the dynamics of MO entanglement and quantum steering are derived analytically. Remarkably, it is found that stable MO quantum resources can survive in the unsteady evolution beyond the steady one, and the unsteady evolution can exhibit the enhanced quality over the limit of quantum resources in the steady-state case. Furthermore, the stable MO entanglement as well as one-way and two-way quantum steerings are efficiently controllable by modulating the effective coupling strength. The validity of our theory is demonstrated by applying it to the typical models of electro-optomechanical and cavity optomagnomechanical hybrid systems.

Abstract: Block encoding is a successful technique used in several powerful quantum algorithms. In this work we provide an explicit quantum circuit for block encoding a sparse matrix with a periodic diagonal structure. The proposed methodology is based on the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) framework and on an efficient unitary operator used to project the complex exponential at a frequency $ω$ multiplied by the computational basis into its real and imaginary components. We demonstrate a distinct computational advantage with a $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(n))$ gate complexity, where $n$ is the number of qubits, in the worst-case scenario used for banded matrices, and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ when dealing with a simple diagonal matrix, compared to the exponential scaling of general-purpose methods for dense matrices. Various applications for the presented methodology are discussed in the context of solving differential problems such as the advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) dynamics, using quantum algorithms with optimal scaling, e.g., quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). Numerical results are used to validate the analytical formulation.

Abstract: The concept of quantum tokens dates back alongside quantum cryptography to Stephen Wiesner's seminal work in 1983[1]. Already this initial work proposes society-relevant applications such as secure quantum banknotes, which can be exchanged between a bank and a customer. This quantum currency is based on various physical states that can be easily verified but is protected from being copied by the fundamental quantum laws. Four decades later, these ideas have flourished in the field of quantum information, and the concept of quantum banknotes has not only adopted many varying names, such as quantum money, quantum coins, quantum-digital payments, and quantum tokens, but also reached its first experimental demonstrations. In this perspective article, we discuss the current state-of-the-art of quantum tokens in the field of quantum information, as well as their future perspectives. We present a number of physical realizations of quantum tokens with integrated quantum memories and their applicability scenarios in detail. Finally, we discuss how quantum tokens fit into the information security ecosystem and consider their relationship to post-quantum cryptography.

### [29] [Ergotropic Mpemba crossings in finite-dimensional quantum batteries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11056)
*Triyas Sapui,Tanoy Kanti Konar,Aditi Sen De*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC) in quantum batteries, showing that for qubits under amplitude damping, EMC depends on initial state coherence; anisotropic noise makes it depend on both coherence and energy; coherent ergotropy is crucial for qubits but not qutrits; non-Markovian dynamics creates multiple odd-numbered crossings; and qubit EMC implies state Mpemba crossing while qutrits break this correspondence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the counterintuitive quantum Mpemba effect to quantum energy storage by studying how ergotropy (extractable work) trajectories intersect, understanding its physical origins, and exploring how different noise types, system dimensions, and environmental memory affect this phenomenon.

Method: Theoretical analysis of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with environments. They defined EMC as intersections of ergotropy trajectories, derived conditions for amplitude damping in qubits, characterized state space regions, decomposed ergotropy into coherent/incoherent components, extended to non-Markovian dynamics, and compared EMC with conventional state Mpemba effect across different dimensions.

Result: 1. Derived EMC condition based on relative coherence for qubits under amplitude damping and fully characterized the EMC region. 2. Showed anisotropic Pauli noise makes EMC jointly depend on coherence and initial energy. 3. Demonstrated coherent ergotropy is crucial for EMC in qubits but not three-level systems. 4. Found non-Markovian environments produce multiple Mpemba crossings (always odd number). 5. Established that qubit EMC implies state Mpemba crossing, but this fails for qutrits.

Conclusion: EMC is a distinct quantum effect governed primarily by initial state coherence, with crucial dependence on coherent ergotropy contributions in low-dimensional systems. Non-Markovianity enhances the effect through multiple crossings. The relationship between EMC and state Mpemba crossing is dimension-dependent, revealing that higher-dimensional quantum batteries exhibit richer, more complex behavior that cannot be reduced to simple state-based Mpemba effects.

Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a state initially farther from equilibrium relaxes more rapidly than one that starts nearer to equilibrium. In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing.

Abstract: We present a projection-based, stability-preserving methodology for computing time correlation functions in open quantum systems governed by generalized quantum master equations with non-Markovian effects. Building upon the memory kernel coupling theory framework, our approach transforms the memory kernel hierarchy into a system of coupled linear differential equations through Mori-Zwanzig projection, followed by spectral projection onto stable eigenmodes to ensure numerical stability. By systematically eliminating unstable modes while preserving the physically relevant dynamics, our method guaranties long-time convergence without introducing artificial damping or ad hoc modifications. The theoretical framework maintains mathematical rigor through orthogonal projection operators and spectral decomposition. Benchmark calculations on the spin-boson model show excellent agreement with exact hierarchical equations of motion results while achieving significant computational efficiency. This approach provides a versatile and reliable framework for simulating non-Markovian dynamics in complex systems.

Abstract: The neutral silicon--vacancy (SiV$^{0}$) center in diamond combines inversion symmetry with optical emission, making it a robust quantum emitter resilient to stray electric fields. Using first-principles density-functional theory, we quantify its response to isotropic strain spanning strong compression and tensile regimes (effective hydrostatic pressures of approximately $-80$ to $180$~GPa). The coexistence of doubly degenerate $e_g$ and $e_u$ levels produces a structural instability captured by a quadratic product Jahn--Teller model. Under isotropic compression, the zero-phonon line blue-shifts nearly linearly while the $E_g$ phonon stiffens, suppressing vibronic instabilities and reducing Jahn--Teller quenching. Consequently, the Ham-reduced excited-state spin--orbit splitting increases substantially and the dark--bright vibronic gap widens. In contrast, isotropic tensile strain enhances vibronic effects and induces symmetry breaking beyond a critical strain, with tunneling-mediated dynamical averaging at the onset. Throughout the symmetry-preserving regime, parity remains well defined, so isotropic strain alone does not activate the dark transition. Charge-transition levels indicate photostability of the emission deep into the compressive regime, and near the highest photostable deformation ($\sim 100$~GPa), the radiative lifetime increases due to a reduced transition dipole moment despite the increasing optical energy. These trends yield compact calibration relations linking optical and spin observables to isotropic strain and establish SiV$^{0}$ as a symmetry-protected, strain-tunable quantum emitter operating into the multi-megabar-equivalent regime.

Conclusion: 这对不可克隆定理提出修正：量子信息可在加密状态下无衰减地任意传播，实际约束是解密机制必须为一次性使用

Abstract: The no-cloning theorem forbids the creation of identical copies of qubits, thereby imposing strong limitations on quantum technologies. A recently-proposed protocol, encrypted cloning, showed, however, that the creation of perfect clones is theoretically possible - if the clones are simultaneously encrypted with a single-use decryption key. It has remained an open question, however, whether encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise and thus practical as a quantum primitive. This is nontrivial because spreading quantum information widely could dilute it until barely exceeding the noise level, leading to catastrophic fidelity decay. Given the complexity of hardware noise, theory and classical simulation are insufficient to settle this. Here, we settle this question experimentally, on IBM Heron-R2 superconducting processors using up to 154 qubits. We find that encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise, even when used as a module, namely in parallel, series or interleaved, while preserving pre-existing entanglement. This establishes it as a versatile quantum primitive for practical use, and it necessitates a refinement to our understanding of the no-cloning theorem: quantum information can be spread at will, in theory and in practice, without dilution or degradation, if encrypted or obscured. The actual constraint is that the decryption mechanism must be single-use.

Motivation: Address the need for quantum state discrimination strategies that maintain reliable performance under moderate noise conditions.

Method: Introduces CrossQSD (generalizing unambiguous discrimination with tunable confidence bounds) and FitQSD (optimizing measurement outcome distributions); unifies them via a hybrid framework interpolating between minimum-error discrimination; formulates optimization as convex/semidefinite programs; synthesizes circuits using modified Naimark dilation; provides open-source automation toolkit.

Result: Enables hardware-efficient quantum circuit implementations with substantially reduced qubit and gate resources, offering a practical path to QSD on current quantum devices.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive suite of flexible, error-tolerant QSD strategies that are both theoretically sound and practically implementable for near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: We develop error-tolerant quantum state discrimination(QSD) strategies that maintain reliable performance under moderate noise. Two complementary approaches are proposed: CrossQSD, which generalizes unambiguous discrimination with tunable confidence bounds to balance accuracy and efficiency, and FitQSD, which optimizes the measurement outcome distribution to approximate that of the ideal noiseless case. Furthermore, we provide a unified hybrid-objective QSD framework that continuously interpolates between minimum-error discrimination (MED) and FitQSD, allowing flexible trade-offs among competing objectives. The associated optimization problems are formulated as convex programs and efficiently solved via disciplined convex programming or, in many cases, semidefinite programming. Additionally, a circuit synthesis framework based on a modified Naimark dilation and isometry synthesis enables hardware-efficient implementations with substantially reduced qubit and gate resources. An open-source toolkit automates the full optimization and synthesis workflow, providing a practical route to QSD on current quantum devices.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for efficient preparation of electronic ground states, leveraging the optimizer ExcitationSolve [Jäger et al., Comm. Phys. (2025)] and established variational quantum eigensolver-based operator selection methods, such as Energy Sorting. By combining these tools, we demonstrate a computationally efficient protocol that enables the construction of an approximate ground state from a unitary coupled cluster ansatz via a single sweep over the operator pool. Utilizing efficient classical pre-processing to select the majority of relevant operators, this approach reduces the computational complexity associated with traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, we show that this method can be seamlessly integrated with one-variational-parameter couple exchange operators, thereby further reducing the number of required CNOT operations. Overall, we empirically observe a quadratic convergence speedup beyond state-of-the-art methods, advancing the realization of quantum advantage in quantum chemistry.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems, due to the existence of exceptional point (or ring, surface), exhibit exotic topological features which are inaccessible with the Hermition ones. Current studies on NH topology mainly focus on pure states at zero temperature, while those on mixed states remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the topological properties of mixed states in two-dimentional NH systems, by use of the Uhlmann phase and the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number which are structured via the Uhlmann connection at specific temperatures, revealing distinct topological features compared to their pure state counterparts. We further extend our study to the mixed states in the three-dimensional Abelian and four-dimentional non-Abelian NH systems and verify the high-order mixed-state topology. Our study provides a conceptual and practical pathway for exploring topological properties in the mixed-state regime of NH physics.

Abstract: Controlling ensembles of weakly coupled spins typically requires computationally expensive multispin optimisations. We present a compact framework that enables control of weakly coupled spin systems (of any spin), but using RF pulses optimised for a single spin-1/2. We do this by explicitly creating a GRAPE pulse with fixed 'active' evolution times using single spin-1/2 methods, and pulsing on one spin at a time. By enforcing this form uniformly across offsets ('band-schematic' pulses),chemical shift and scalar coupling evolution of the entire system can be precisely controlled. We demonstrate the approach by constructing band-schematic pulses and a continuously irradiated joint INEPT (JINEPT) that achieves band-selective transfer $I_z \rightarrow 2I_zS_z$. The framework is implemented in the software Seedless, which both rapidly generates such pulses and analyses the schematic form of arbitrary pulses, enabling robust multi-spin control, without multi-spin optimisation.

Abstract: Quantum technologies are powered by platforms to generate complex non-classical states of matter or light to realize applications. We investigate the non-classical properties of high-harmonic generation in semiconductors, an emerging photonic platform. Measuring the click statistics of three double-digit orders, we evaluate witness operators to certify the non-classicality of the generated states. We show that higher-order harmonics driven by a coherent laser are squeezed and entangled. The properties of the emission are well retrieved with an entangled Gaussian state model, obtained by numerical state optimization to multiple observables. Additionally, we perform inter-order heralded measurements to engineer the quantum state of the emission. The heralded states have distinct properties, showing anti-bunched photon statistics. Further, we witness the generation of a quantum non-Gaussian state, a resource highly relevant for quantum information. With this, we establish high-harmonic generation as a platform for generating quantum optical resources.

Motivation: 量子计算承诺为多目标优化问题带来指数级加速优势，但现有变分量子多目标优化(QMOO)算法性能尚需提升。研究者希望探索量子计算能否真正为这类日常工业应用中的冲突目标优化问题提供实质性改进。

Method: 引入Pareto档案和支配解替换机制来改进QMOO算法；提出使用RMNK景观作为统一基准测试平台；设计经典到量子的景观映射方法；进行数值超参数调优；并与经典多目标求解器NSGA-II/III进行对比实验。

Conclusion: QMOO算法在针对特定任务进行精细调优后，可能在解决更困难的多目标优化问题上超越经典算法，这为量子计算在该领域的实际应用提供了积极前景，但目前仍需解决计算成本问题。

Abstract: Finding optimal solutions of conflicting objectives is a daily matter in many industrial applications, with multi-objective optimization trying to find the best solutions to them. The advent of quantum computing has led to researchers wondering if the promised exponential advantage can be obtained for these problems by variational quantum multi-objective optimization (QMOO) algorithm. Here, we improve it by introducing a Pareto Archive and dominated solutions substitution, clearly improving in hyper-volume convergence at additional quantum and classical cost. We propose the use of RMNK-landscapes as a unifying testbed for benchmarking QMOO, as it is common in classical multi-objective field. By devising a generic classical-to-quantum mapping of these landscapes, we perform a numerical hyperparameter tuning of QMOO, significantly enhancing its performance. Finally, we compare QMOO against well-known classical solvers for multi-objective tasks, NSGA-II/III, showing comparable results in small instances. Our results demonstrate that QMOO, when carefully tuned for the task at hand, might be advantageous on harder problems than its classical counterparts.

Abstract: Instantaneous quantum polynomial quantum circuit Born machines (IQP-QCBMs) have been proposed as quantum generative models with a classically tractable training objective based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and a potential quantum advantage motivated by sampling-complexity arguments, making them an exciting model worth deeper investigation. While recent works have further proven the universality of a (slightly generalized) model, the next immediate question pertains to its trainability, i.e., whether it suffers from the exponentially vanishing loss gradients, known as the barren plateau issue, preventing effective use, and how regimes of trainability overlap with regimes of possible quantum advantage. Here, we provide significant strides in these directions. To study the trainability at initialization, we analytically derive closed-form expressions for the variances of the partial derivatives of the MMD loss function and provide general upper and lower bounds. With uniform initialization, we show that barren plateaus depend on the generator set and the spectrum of the chosen kernel. We identify regimes in which low-weight-biased kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression in structured topologies. Also, we prove that a small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial scaling for the gradient under mild conditions. As for the potential quantum advantage, we further argue, based on previous complexity-theoretic arguments, that sparse IQP families can output a probability distribution family that is classically intractable, and that this distribution remains trainable at initialization at least at lower-weight frequencies.

Conclusion: 为固定频率超导量子计算平台提供无需磁通调谐或AC-Stark频移的TLS光谱分析工具

Abstract: Transmon qubits are a cornerstone of modern superconducting quantum computing platforms. Temporal fluctuations of energy relaxation in these qubits are widely attributed to microscopic two-level systems (TLSs) in device dielectrics and interfaces, yet isolating individual defects typically relies on tuning the qubit or the TLS into resonance. We demonstrate a novel spectroscopy method for fixed-frequency transmons based on multilevel relaxation: repeated preparation of the second excited state and simultaneous $T_1$ extraction of the first and second excited states reveals characteristic correlations in the decay rates of adjacent transitions. From these correlations we identify one or more dominant TLSs and reconstruct their frequency drift over time. Remarkably, we find that TLSs detuned by $\gtrsim 100\,\mathrm{MHz}$ from the qubit transition can still significantly influence relaxation. The proposed method provides a powerful tool for TLS spectroscopy without the need to tune the transmon frequency, either via a flux-tunable inductor or AC-Stark shifts.

Conclusion: 各向异性约束的Vicsek模型能统一解释实验室与野外观测差异，为昆虫群体集体行为提供更准确的理论框架

Abstract: As collective states of animal groups go, swarms of midge insects pose a number of puzzling questions. Their ordering polarization parameter is quite small and the insects are weakly coupled among themselves but strongly coupled to the swarm. In laboratory studies (free of external perturbations), the correlation length is small, whereas midge swarms exhibit strong correlations, scale free behavior and power laws for correlation length, susceptibility and correlation time in field studies. Data for the dynamic correlation function versus time collapse to a single curve only for small values of time scaled with the correlation time. Is there a theory that explains these disparate observations? Among the existing theories, whodunnit? Here we review and discuss several models proposed in the literature and extend our own one, the harmonically confined Vicsek model, to anisotropic confinement. Numerical simulations of the latter produce elongated swarm shapes and values of the static critical exponents between those of the two dimensional and isotropic three dimensional models. The new values agree better with those measured in natural swarms.

Conclusion: 主动系统能够突破传统热力学限制，展现出复杂且非直观的热力学行为，为随机热力学研究提供了新见解和应用可能性。

Abstract: Thermodynamic cycles are idealized processes that can convert heat into work or produce heat flow against a temperature gradient with the input of work. They remain an active area of research in modern stochastic thermodynamics. In particular, cyclic active heat engines have been shown to display a rich phenomenology, such as ``violations'' of the Carnot bound on efficiency and an improved performance in comparison to their passive counterparts. We introduce the concept of cyclic active refrigerators using a previously derived second law for cyclic active systems. We show that for cyclic active refrigerators, a naive definition of the coefficient of performance can exceed the bound set by the standard second law for passive refrigerators. We also show that cyclic active systems can behave like a Maxwell's demon, with heat flowing from the cold to the hot reservoir without any work input. Beyond this phase, cyclic active systems can enter a hybrid phase, functioning as both a heat engine and a refrigerator simultaneously. Our results are obtained with two models that involve active Brownian particles, a simpler one that allows for analytical results and a more realistic one that is analyzed through numerical simulations.

Conclusion: 噪声显著改变非平衡动力学相图，诱导最大混合模产生并揭示系统存在普适标度行为，为理解开放量子系统临界动力学提供新视角

Abstract: We investigate scaling and universality in nonequilibrium spin correlation functions in the presence of uncorrelated noise. In the absence of noise, spin correlation functions exhibit a crossover from monotonic decay at fast sweep velocities to oscillatory behavior at slow sweeps. We show that, under a stochastically driven field, the critical sweep velocity at which the spin correlation functions undergo an abrupt change decreases with increasing noise strength and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. Remarkably, when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are comparable, the excitation probability becomes locked to pk = 1/2 over a finite momentum window, signaling the emergence of noise-induced maximally mixed modes. This gives rise to a highly oscillatory region in the dynamical phase diagram, whose threshold sweep velocity increases with noise and likewise exhibits quadratic scaling with the noise strength. Finally, we identify a universal scaling function under which all boundary sweep-velocity curves collapse onto a single universal curve.

Motivation: 从大肠杆菌趋化性到线虫神经元，生物感觉系统如何在强噪声和过阻尼环境中实现可靠适应性，缺乏统一理论解释。

Method: 采用Onsager-Machlup路径积分方法，将感觉适应性建模为生物体与环境间的随机微分博弈，基于变分自由能原理构建理论框架。

Result: 适应性动力学等价于模型参考自适应控制；相位过冲源于记忆-耗散耦合产生的有效惯性(m*≈τγ)；跨物种数据拟合R²>0.88；系统在信噪比与稳定性约束下的狭窄热力学最优区运行。

Conclusion: 该框架统一解释了生物感觉适应性的物理机制，表明其通过物理耦合而非生化微调实现鲁棒性，并在热力学约束下达到最优。

Abstract: Biological sensory systems, from \textit{E.~coli} chemotaxis to sensory neurons in \textit{C.~elegans}, achieve reliable adaptation over wide dynamic ranges despite operating in strongly noisy and overdamped regimes. Here, we present a field-theoretic framework in which sensory adaptation emerges from a variational free-energy principle, formulated as a stochastic differential game between an organism and its environment. Using an Onsager--Machlup path-integral formalism, we show that the resulting adaptive dynamics are mathematically equivalent to a class of model reference adaptive control schemes and can be interpreted as a dynamic renormalization of the system's Green's function. Within this framework, the phasic overshoot commonly observed in sensory responses arises naturally from an effective inertia ($m^* \approx τγ$) generated by memory-dissipation coupling, rather than from biochemical fine-tuning. Quantitative fits to experimental data across species yield $R^2 > 0.88$, and indicate that adaptive sensory processing operates within a narrow thermodynamically optimal regime bounded by signal-to-noise and stability constraints.

TL;DR: 本研究通过分子动力学模拟揭示，与NaCl等传统单价电解质表现出的阳离子选择性不同，CaCl₂等多价电解质在带负电纳米孔中可表现出反常的阴离子优先输运，这是由于电荷反转和离子固定化效应导致的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统理论认为带负电纳米孔对阳离子具有选择性，但这一理论在多价电解质体系中因强烈的离子-表面关联和电荷反转效应而失效，需要深入研究以理解其改变的输运行为。

Method: 采用缩放电荷离子模型的原子级分子动力学模拟，研究NaCl和CaCl₂在带负电二氧化硅纳米孔中的传导，通过分离径向粒子电流密度的浓度和速度贡献，将静态吸附与动态选择透过性联系起来。

Result: NaCl表现出常规的阳离子选择性，而CaCl₂则呈现接近体相或甚至阴离子优先的输运特性。这是由于Ca²⁺在孔表面附近固定化，以及电荷反转后孔内部Cl⁻主导传导所致。该机制具有鲁棒性，但具体表现对力场参数敏感。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明多价离子可通过电荷反转从根本上改变纳米孔中的离子输运机制，其具体表现取决于力场中离子-表面与离子-水相互作用的平衡，提示精确参数化对准确预测至关重要。

Abstract: Ion transport through charged nanopores is commonly interpreted in terms of electrical double layer structure, leading to the expectation of cation-selective conduction in negatively charged pores. This picture can break down for multivalent electrolytes, where strong ion-urface correlations and charge inversion modify transport behavior. Here, we study NaCl and CaCl$_2$ conduction through negatively charged silica nanopores using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with scaled-charge ion models. By separating concentration and velocity contributions to the radial particle current density, we connect static adsorption to dynamic perm-selectivity. While NaCl exhibits conventional cation selectivity, CaCl$_2$ shows nearly bulk-like or even anion-favored transport due to Ca$^{2+}$ immobilization near the surface and dominant Cl$^-$ conduction in the pore interior following charge inversion. Although this qualitative mechanism is robust, its detailed manifestation depends sensitively on the balance of ion-surface and ion-water interactions encoded in the force field.

Result: 获得剪切带位移场的解析表达式，揭示弹性模量对剪切带宽度的调控（从韧性到脆性特征）；发现能量泛函Hessian矩阵特征值在临界应力处趋于零，预测剪切带失稳的临界应力值。

Conclusion: 该理论成功描述了非晶固体剪切带失稳的物理机制，为预测材料失效和调控剪切带行为提供了理论基础，弥补了经典弹性理论的不足。

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to offer an analytic theory of the shear banding instability in amorphous solids that are subjected to athermal quasi-static shear. To this aim we derive nonlinear equations for the displacement field, including the consequences of plastic deformation on the mechanical response of amorphous solids. The plastic events collectively induce distributed dipoles that are responsible for screening effects and the creation of typical length-scales that are absent in classical elasticity theory. The nonlinear theory exposes an instability that results in the creation of shear bands. By solving the weakly nonlinear amplitude equation we present analytic expressions for the displacement fields that is associated with shear bands, explaining the role of the elastic moduli that determine the width of a shear band from ductile to brittle characteristics. We derive an energy functional whose Hessian possesses an eigenvalue that goes to zero at the shear-banding instability, providing a prediction for the critical value of the accumulated stress that results in an instability.

Abstract: A theory of structure is formulated for systems of many structureless classical particles with stable local interactions in Euclidean space. Such systems are shown to have their structure in thermodynamic equilibrium determined exactly by a random field of fine local descriptions and approximately by coarsenings thereof. The degree of order in the local cluster consisting of a particle and its neighbors is identified as a universal source of coarse local descriptions and characterized by expressing the behavior of configurational entropy in local microscopic terms. A local measure of the angular redundancy in neighboring particle positions is found to satisfy this characterization and thereby established as a valid local order quantifier. A precise relationship between order and symmetry is obtained by bounding this quantifier sharply from below by a simple function of the local point group and the largest stabilizer under its action on the set of bond pairs. The marginal distribution of the quantifier is given in closed form for highly coordinated particles with broadly distributed bond angles. Applications are made to the ideal gas, perfect crystal, and simple liquid.

Conclusion: SSD过程通过合成-降解平衡显著优化生物分子搜索效率，临界合成速率的普适关系为理解细胞内运输机制提供了新理论框架。

Abstract: Processes controlled by stochastic synthesis and degradation (SSD) are widespread in biology but their reaction kinetics are not well understood. Using methods borrowed from the theory of resetting processes, we determine the first-passage properties of a collection of independent particles that are synthesized and degraded at constant rates, and follow an arbitrary diffusive process in space. At equal synthesis and degradation rates, the mean reaction time with a target site can be minimized as in stochastic resetting, and a $CV$-criterion is derived. When the degradation rate is held fixed and the synthesis costs are taken into account, an optimal synthesis rate is obtained. In bounded domains, despite particle degradation, SSD improves the mean search time compared to a single non-degrading particle if the synthesis rate exceeds a critical value. The latter obeys a universal relation. We illustrate these findings with Brownian diffusion on the infinite line and in an interval.

Conclusion: FPSL被确立为一种用于多维自由能估算的数据高效且可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Many biological processes involve numerous coupled degrees of freedom, yet free-energy estimation is often restricted to one-dimensional profiles to mitigate the high computational cost of multidimensional sampling. In this work, we extend Fokker--Planck Score Learning (FPSL) to efficiently reconstruct two-dimensional free-energy landscapes from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations using different types of collective variables. We show that explicitly modeling orthogonal degrees of freedom reveals insights hidden in one-dimensional projections at negligible computational overhead. Additionally, exploiting symmetries in the underlying landscape enhances reconstruction accuracy, while regularization techniques ensure numerical robustness in sparsely sampled regions. We validate our approach on three distinct systems: the conformational dynamics of alanine dipeptide, as well as coarse-grained and all-atom models of solute permeation through lipid bilayers. We demonstrate that, because FPSL learns a smooth score function rather than histogram-based densities, it overcomes the exponential scaling of grid-based methods, establishing it as a data-efficient and scalable tool for multidimensional free-energy estimation.

Conclusion: 研究为人机战略行为差异提供了新分析框架，揭示了驱动行为差异的结构性因素，为理解人工智能在复杂社会场景中的行为特征奠定基础。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in social and strategic scenarios, it becomes critical to understand where and why their behavior diverges from that of humans. While behavioral game theory (BGT) provides a framework for analyzing behavior, existing models do not fully capture the idiosyncratic behavior of humans or black-box, non-human agents like LLMs. We employ AlphaEvolve, a cutting-edge program discovery tool, to directly discover interpretable models of human and LLM behavior from data, thereby enabling open-ended discovery of structural factors driving human and LLM behavior. Our analysis on iterated rock-paper-scissors reveals that frontier LLMs can be capable of deeper strategic behavior than humans. These results provide a foundation for understanding structural differences driving differences in human and LLM behavior in strategic interactions.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical settings demands rigorous and reliable evaluation. However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints.

TL;DR: Found-RL: A platform that efficiently integrates Vision-Language Models with Reinforcement Learning for autonomous driving using asynchronous batch inference and distillation mechanisms, achieving near-VLM performance at 500 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning (RL) dominates end-to-end autonomous driving but suffers from sample inefficiency and poor semantic interpretability. Foundation models offer rich context-aware knowledge but their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops.

Method: The authors propose Found-RL with: (1) Asynchronous batch inference framework that decouples VLM reasoning from simulation to resolve latency bottlenecks; (2) Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into RL policies; (3) High-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping, enhanced by Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment that conditions on speed/command to address CLIP's dynamic blindness.

Result: A lightweight RL model achieves near-VLM performance while sustaining real-time inference (~500 FPS). The platform provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration, significantly outperforming traditional RL baselines without the computational cost of billion-parameter models.

Conclusion: Found-RL successfully bridges foundation models and RL for autonomous driving, creating an efficient and interpretable framework that enables real-time learning with VLM-level performance, democratizing access to advanced driving policies without massive compute requirements.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD). However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS). Code, data, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/ys-qu/found-rl.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型(LLMs)能否作为QNP抽象生成器服务于广义规划(GP)，并解决抽象生成过程中的错误修正问题。

Method: 提出提示协议：输入GP领域和训练任务至LLM，引导其生成抽象特征并将初始状态、动作集和目标转化为QNP问题；设计自动化调试方法检测抽象错误并引导LLM修正。

Result: 实验表明，在自动化调试指导下，部分大语言模型能够生成有用的QNP抽象。

Conclusion: 自动化调试可有效提升LLM生成QNP抽象的准确性，验证了LLM作为广义规划抽象生成器的可行性。

Abstract: Qualitative Numerical Planning (QNP) serves as an important abstraction model for generalized planning (GP), which aims to compute general plans that solve multiple instances at once. Recent works show that large language models (LLMs) can function as generalized planners. This work investigates whether LLMs can serve as QNP abstraction generators for GP problems and how to fix abstractions via automated debugging. We propose a prompt protocol: input a GP domain and training tasks to LLMs, prompting them to generate abstract features and further abstract the initial state, action set, and goal into QNP problems. An automated debugging method is designed to detect abstraction errors, guiding LLMs to fix abstractions. Experiments demonstrate that under properly guided by automated debugging, some LLMs can generate useful QNP abstractions.

### [55] [Flow of Spans: Generalizing Language Models to Dynamic Span-Vocabulary via GFlowNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10583)
*Bo Xue,Yunchong Song,Fanghao Shao,Xuekai Zhu,Lin Chen,Luoyi Fu,Xinbing Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FOSS is a GFlowNets-based framework for span generation that constructs a dynamic span vocabulary and DAG-structured state space to enable diverse compositional path exploration, outperforming token-level baselines by significant margins on text generation and knowledge-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard autoregressive language models have tree-structured state spaces that limit flexibility and expressiveness. Dynamic vocabulary approaches with retrieved text spans overlook the DAG structure of span compositions, restricting exploration and biasing path selection. While GFlowNets can efficiently explore DAG state spaces, existing GFlowNet-based LMs remain token-level and tree-structured, limiting their potential.

Method: Propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a GFlowNets framework that constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by flexibly segmenting retrieved text, ensures a DAG-structured state space for span generation, uses GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths, and employs specialized reward models for high-quality text generation.

Result: FOSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer baselines on text generation, achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and benefits from scaling with larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora while maintaining its advantage.

Conclusion: FOSS successfully extends GFlowNets to span-level generation with a principled DAG-structured state space, demonstrating significant improvements in text generation quality and knowledge-intensive tasks, showing strong scaling potential and validating the effectiveness of span-based dynamic vocabulary for language modeling.

Abstract: Standard autoregressive language models generate text token-by-token from a fixed vocabulary, inducing a tree-structured state space when viewing token sampling as an action, which limits flexibility and expressiveness. Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出神经符号动作掩码(NSAM)框架，通过在深度强化学习过程中以最少监督方式自动学习符合领域约束的符号模型，并基于该模型学习动作掩码来排除不可行动作，从而提升样本效率并减少约束违反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习在训练和执行过程中会探索不可行的动作。现有方法依赖于人工指定的符号接地函数和动作掩码技术，缺乏自动化和适应性。

Method: NSAM框架在DRL过程中以最少监督方式自动学习符号模型，使其与给定高维状态的领域约束保持一致。基于学习到的状态符号模型，NSAM进一步学习动作掩码来排除不可行动作。该框架实现了符号推理与深度策略优化的端到端集成，符号接地与策略学习的改进相互增强。

Result: 在多个带约束的领域上的实验评估表明，NSAM显著提高了DRL智能体的样本效率，同时大幅减少了约束违反。

Conclusion: NSAM成功地将符号推理与深度强化学习相结合，通过自动学习符号模型和动作掩码，有效解决了DRL中不可行动作探索的问题。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) may explore infeasible actions during training and execution. Existing approaches assume a symbol grounding function that maps high-dimensional states to consistent symbolic representations and a manually specified action masking techniques to constrain actions. In this paper, we propose Neuro-symbolic Action Masking (NSAM), a novel framework that automatically learn symbolic models, which are consistent with given domain constraints of high-dimensional states, in a minimally supervised manner during the DRL process. Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions. NSAM enables end-to-end integration of symbolic reasoning and deep policy optimization, where improvements in symbolic grounding and policy learning mutually reinforce each other. We evaluate NSAM on multiple domains with constraints, and experimental results demonstrate that NSAM significantly improves sample efficiency of DRL agent while substantially reducing constraint violations.

TL;DR: 研究系统检验了大型推理模型(LRMs)在心理理论(ToM)任务上的表现，发现推理模型相比非推理模型并无持续优势，甚至表现更差，揭示了其依赖选项匹配捷径而非真实推理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LRMs在数学和代码等正式推理领域取得显著进展，但这些能力是否能迁移到社会认知技能如心理理论(ToM)仍不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 对9个先进大语言模型在3个代表性ToM基准上进行系统比较，分析推理模型与非推理模型的表现差异，并通过移除选择题选项等精细分析识别潜在问题。

Result: 推理模型未持续优于非推理模型，甚至表现更差。三大发现：1）慢思考崩溃：响应越长准确率越低，增大推理预算反而损害性能；2）适度自适应推理有益：约束推理长度可缓解失败，需要动态适应；3）选项匹配捷径：移除选择题选项后推理模型大幅提升，表明依赖匹配而非真实推理。

Conclusion: LRMs在形式推理上的优势无法完全迁移到社会推理任务如ToM，实现稳健的ToM需要超越现有推理方法的独特能力。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) assesses whether models can infer hidden mental states such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, which is essential for natural social interaction. Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning. We conclude that achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出HARPO（异质性感知相对策略优化）方法，通过调整优势函数平衡跨异质性社会行为任务的学习，防止单一任务主导优化过程。基于此方法训练的Omnisapiens-7B 2.0模型在多项社会行为任务上实现显著性能提升，多任务场景最高提升16.85%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常孤立地建模人类行为维度（如情感、认知、社交属性），导致训练成本高且泛化能力受限。虽然近期的推理强化学习方法支持多任务统一建模，但无法显式处理异构行为数据。为此需要一种能在异构任务间平衡学习的方法。

Method: 提出Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO)，一种异质性感知的强化学习方法。核心是通过调制优势函数，确保在策略优化过程中没有单个任务或样本能施加不成比例的影响力，从而平衡跨异构任务的学习。

Result: 开发了Omnisapiens-7B 2.0基础模型，相比现有行为基础模型，在多任务和留出测试集上分别获得最高16.85%和9.37%的性能提升，并产生更明确、鲁棒的推理轨迹。HARPO在对比实验中展现出最稳定的一致性表现。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了社会行为建模中的异质性学习难题，证明在优化过程中平衡各类任务影响力能显著提升基础模型的跨任务性能和泛化能力，为开发社会智能AI提供了有效路径。

Abstract: To develop socially intelligent AI, existing approaches typically model human behavioral dimensions (e.g., affective, cognitive, or social attributes) in isolation. Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks.

Motivation: 生成式推荐模型RL微调存在概率-奖励失配，传统似然主导解码（如beam search）产生近视偏差，导致探索不足和优势压缩两大问题，削弱RL比较信号

Method: 提出V-STAR框架：1)价值引导高效解码(VED)识别关键节点并选择性地深化高潜力前缀；2)Sibling-GRPO利用树形拓扑计算兄弟节点相对优势，聚焦分支决策学习

Result: 离线与在线实验表明V-STAR在严格延迟约束下显著优于SOTA基线，取得更高精度和候选集多样性

Conclusion: V-STAR通过价值引导和树结构优势奖励形成自进化循环，有效解决生成式推荐RL微调的核心挑战，为探索与学习信号优化提供新范式

Abstract: Generative recommendation via autoregressive models has unified retrieval and ranking into a single conditional generation framework. However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets demonstrate that V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints.

Conclusion: 学科特定需求强调了利益相关者参与的重要性。高层需求和框架为大学在解决利益相关者担忧并确保合规的同时利用GenAI提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Many staff and students in higher education have adopted generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in their work and study. GenAI is expected to enhance cognitive systems by enabling personalized learning and streamlining educational services. However, stakeholders perceptions of GenAI in higher education remain divided, shaped by cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts. In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education. The high-level requirements and the framework provide practical guidance for universities aiming to harness GenAI while addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring regulatory compliance.

Result: 在最先进的多模态语言模型和GUI智能体上发现显著的推理-执行差距，尽管规划能力强，但在细粒度GUI操作上仍面临持续挑战

Conclusion: AI智能体在图形化编程界面中的精细操作能力是薄弱环节，需要针对性改进以弥合推理与执行之间的鸿沟

Abstract: Block-based programming environments such as Scratch play a central role in low-code education, yet evaluating the capabilities of AI agents to construct programs through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) remains underexplored. We introduce ScratchWorld, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal GUI agents on program-by-construction tasks in Scratch. Grounded in the Use-Modify-Create pedagogical framework, ScratchWorld comprises 83 curated tasks spanning four distinct problem categories: Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute. To rigorously diagnose the source of agent failures, the benchmark employs two complementary interaction modes: primitive mode requires fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation to directly assess visuomotor control, while composite mode uses high-level semantic APIs to disentangle program reasoning from GUI execution. To ensure reliable assessment, we propose an execution-based evaluation protocol that validates the functional correctness of the constructed Scratch programs through runtime tests within the browser environment. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art multimodal language models and GUI agents reveal a substantial reasoning--acting gap, highlighting persistent challenges in fine-grained GUI manipulation despite strong planning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGC methods suffer from "structural resolution mismatch" where they fail to handle varying graph densities, causing structural noise in dense clusters and catastrophic representation collapse in sparse regions.

Method: Proposes SynergyKGC framework with: (1) Cross-Modal Synergy Expert using relation-aware cross-attention and semantic-intent-driven gating; (2) Density-dependent Identity Anchoring strategy; (3) Double-tower Coherent Consistency architecture.

Result: Systematic evaluations on two public benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in KGC hit rates and empirical evidence for resilient information integration.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reconciles topological heterogeneity while ensuring representational stability, providing a generalized principle for non-homogeneous structured data integration.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) fundamentally hinges on the coherent fusion of pre-trained entity semantics with heterogeneous topological structures to facilitate robust relational reasoning. However, existing paradigms encounter a critical "structural resolution mismatch," failing to reconcile divergent representational demands across varying graph densities, which precipitates structural noise interference in dense clusters and catastrophic representation collapse in sparse regions. We present SynergyKGC, an adaptive framework that advances traditional neighbor aggregation to an active Cross-Modal Synergy Expert via relation-aware cross-attention and semantic-intent-driven gating. By coupling a density-dependent Identity Anchoring strategy with a Double-tower Coherent Consistency architecture, SynergyKGC effectively reconciles topological heterogeneity while ensuring representational stability across training and inference phases. Systematic evaluations on two public benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in significantly boosting KGC hit rates, providing empirical evidence for a generalized principle of resilient information integration in non-homogeneous structured data.

TL;DR: 提出RLCER方法，通过自生成和自演化的评分标准来自主奖励LLM思维链，无需人工标注，性能优于现有方法并提升推理效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链(CoT)在LLM推理中起关键作用，但直接奖励CoT存在困难：训练奖励模型需要大量人工标注，且静态奖励模型难以适应演化的CoT分布并易受奖励黑客攻击。这促使研究者寻求无需人工标注、能逐步演化的自主CoT奖励方法。

Method: 受近期自演化训练方法启发，提出RLCER（基于自演化评分标准的思维链监督强化学习），通过自生成和自演化的评分标准来增强以结果为中心的RLVR方法，实现对CoT的奖励。

Result: 自生成和自演化的评分标准即使在缺乏结果奖励的情况下也能提供可靠的CoT监督信号，使RLCER性能超越以结果为中心的RLVR。此外，将这些评分标准作为提示中的提示还能进一步提升推理时性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需人工标注的自主思维链奖励，通过自演化评分标准不仅提升了模型性能，还增强了推理能力，为LLM推理优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Despite chain-of-thought (CoT) playing crucial roles in LLM reasoning, directly rewarding it is difficult: training a reward model demands heavy human labeling efforts, and static RMs struggle with evolving CoT distributions and reward hacking. These challenges motivate us to seek an autonomous CoT rewarding approach that requires no human annotation efforts and can evolve gradually. Inspired by recent self-evolving training methods, we propose \textbf{RLCER} (\textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{C}oT Supervision via Self-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{R}ubrics), which enhances the outcome-centric RLVR by rewarding CoTs with self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics. We show that self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics provide reliable CoT supervision signals even without outcome rewards, enabling RLCER to outperform outcome-centric RLVR. Moreover, when used as in-prompt hints, these self-proposed rubrics further improve inference-time performance.

TL;DR: 研究发现在跨文化菜谱生成中，LLM无法像人类一样进行有意义的文化适配。其生成菜谱的差异性与文化距离无关，内部文化信息保存薄弱，对创造力/传统理解存在偏差，且无法基于食材等文化显著元素进行有效适配，揭示了LLM在文化敏感应用中的根本局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型日益广泛用于生成文化内容，其系统性文化偏见引发对刻板印象、同质化及文化多样性丧失的担忧。如何使LLM与主流文化之外的多元文化实现有意义对齐成为关键挑战。

Method: 以烹饪菜谱为切入点（文化、传统与创造力高度融合），基于GlobalFusion数据集（按文化距离配对不同国家的人类菜谱），使用相同国家对让多个LLM生成文化适配菜谱，直接对比人类与LLM的跨文化创作行为。

Result: LLM无法生成文化代表性适配菜谱：1) 生成菜谱的差异性与文化距离无相关性；2) 内部表征中文化信息保存薄弱；3) 误解创造力与传统概念而夸大新颖性；4) 无法将适配与国家关联，也不能基于食材等文化显著元素进行 grounding。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了当前LLM在文化导向生成任务中的根本缺陷，对文化敏感应用（如跨文化内容创作）具有重要警示意义，表明模型尚不具备真正的文化理解和适应能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications.

TL;DR: 针对压缩映射的ε-不动点求解问题，提出时间复杂度为O(log^⌈k/2⌉(1/ε))的新算法，在ℓ∞和ℓ1范数下均适用，改进了之前O(log^k(1/ε))的复杂度界


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算ε-不动点是博弈论、经济学和数值分析等领域的基础问题。现有最优算法的时间复杂度为O(log^k(1/ε))，指数级依赖维度k，限制了高维问题的计算效率

Method: 提出新的算法技术，在常数维度k的假设下，针对[0,1]^k上的压缩映射，实现对ℓ∞和ℓ1范数下ε-不动点的高效计算

Result: 在ℓ∞和ℓ1范数下均获得O(log^⌈k/2⌉(1/ε))的运行时间，相比先前最优结果[SS03, FGMS20]的O(log^k(1/ε))有显著改进

Conclusion: 该工作将ε-不动点计算的复杂度指数从k降至⌈k/2⌉，对发展高效的高维不动点算法和拓展应用范围具有重要意义

Abstract: We study the problem of finding an $ε$-fixed point of a contraction map $f:[0,1]^k\mapsto[0,1]^k$ under both the $\ell_\infty$-norm and the $\ell_1$-norm. For both norms, we give an algorithm with running time $O(\log^{\lceil k/2\rceil}(1/ε))$, for any constant $k$. These improve upon the previous best $O(\log^k(1/ε))$-time algorithm for the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm by Shellman and Sikorski [SS03], and the previous best $O(\log^k (1/ε))$-time algorithm for the $\ell_{1}$-norm by Fearnley, Gordon, Mehta and Savani [FGMS20].

### [66] [Self-referential instances of the dominating set problem are irreducible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10559)
*Guangyan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: 该论文证明，要判断随机图中是否存在大小为ln n的支配集，几乎需要检查整个图，揭示了该问题的计算困难性源于全局解空间性质而非局部图结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解随机图中支配集问题的计算困难性是由局部结构特征还是解空间的全局特性引起的。

Method: 通过分析具有精心调谐边概率p(n)的Erdos-Renyi随机图G(n,p)，并构造仅改变常数条边的局部对称映射来翻转支配集的存在性。

Result: 对任意常数c<1，仅检查n^c个顶点的算法无法判定G(n,p)是否包含大小为ln n的支配集，因为此类支配集的存在性可通过改变O(1)条边来切换，导致实例在局部不可区分。

Conclusion: 随机图中支配集问题的极端困难性源于其解空间的自指性和近独立性的全局结构，这意味着局部算法本质上是不足的。

Abstract: We study the algorithmic decidability of the domination number in the Erdos-Renyi random graph model $G(n,p)$. We show that for a carefully chosen edge probability $p=p(n)$, the domination problem exhibits a strong irreducible property. Specifically, for any constant $0<c<1$, no algorithm that inspects only an induced subgraph of order at most $n^c$ can determine whether $G(n,p)$ contains a dominating set of size $k=\ln n$. We demonstrate that the existence of such a dominating set can be flipped by a local symmetry mapping that alters only a constant number of edges, thereby producing indistinguishable random graph instances which require exhaustive search. These results demonstrate that the extreme hardness of the dominating set problem in random graphs cannot be attributed to local structure, but instead arises from the self-referential nature and near-independence structure of the entire solution space.

TL;DR: 本文研究最大公共顶点子图问题，证明其NP难性，给出以h为参数的FPT算法，并完成基于结构参数（顶点覆盖数、最大度、树深、路径宽、树宽）的完整参数化复杂性二分分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作为最大公共子图问题的自然变体，该问题要求公共子图不含孤立顶点（每个连通分量至少2个顶点），在图论和计算社会选择领域具有应用价值。

Method: 通过理论证明确立NP难性，设计以h为参数的FPT算法，并系统分析结构参数及其组合下的参数化复杂性二分法定理。

Result: 问题被证明为NP难；当参数为h时存在FPT算法；在各类结构参数（顶点覆盖数、最大度等）及其组合下，问题呈现完整的FPT/W[1]-hard二分分类。

Conclusion: 研究全面揭示了最大公共顶点子图问题的参数化复杂性 landscape，为理解该问题的计算复杂性提供了深度理论洞察。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Maximum Common Vertex Subgraph problem: Given two input graphs $G_1,G_2$ and a non-negative integer $h$, is there a common subgraph $H$ on at least $h$ vertices such that there is no isolated vertex in $H$. In other words, each connected component of $H$ has at least $2$ vertices. This problem naturally arises in graph theory along with other variants of the well-studied Maximum Common Subgraph problem and also has applications in computational social choice. We show that this problem is NP-hard and provide an FPT algorithm when parameterized by $h$. Next, we conduct a study of the problem on common structural parameters like vertex cover number, maximum degree, treedepth, pathwidth and treewidth of one or both input graphs. We derive a complete dichotomy of parameterized results for our problem with respect to individual parameterizations as well as combinations of parameterizations from the above structural parameters. This provides us with a deep insight into the complexity theoretic and parameterized landscape of this problem.

Result: SAT和子集和问题的确定性图灵机均可在多项式时间内运行，对可满足实例能确定性地生成有效证明，将框架扩展至确定性FNP计算且不增加多项式次数

Conclusion: 成功将NP验证器框架扩展至NP完全问题的确定性计算，提供了完整实现与源代码，验证了多项式时间边界

Abstract: While prior work established a verifier-based polynomial time framework for NP, explicit deterministic machines for concrete NP-complete problems have remained elusive.
  In this paper, we construct fully specified deterministic Turing Machines (DTMs) for SAT and Subset-Sum within a polynomial-time NP verifier simulation framework.
  We show that both machines operate in polynomial time and, for satisfiable instances, deterministically generate valid witnesses, thereby extending the framework to deterministic FNP computation without increasing the degree of polynomial complexity. Furthermore, we provide a complete implementation of the framework, including the dynamic computation graph, feasible-graph construction, verification walks, and Turing-machine simulation via edge extensions. The implementation behaves in accordance with the predicted polynomial-time bounds.
  To ensure transparency and reproducibility, the complete Python implementation and source code are made available in a public online repository.

Motivation: 探究生态系统中多平衡相的形成机制及其对物种多样性和稳定性的影响。

Result: 发现两种不同的多平衡相，它们在平衡点受外来物种入侵时的内部稳定性行为上存在本质差异。

Conclusion: 该结果深化了对复杂生态系统动力学行为的理解，尤其对多样性与稳定性关系提供了新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the Multiple Equilibria phase of generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics with random, non-reciprocal interactions. We compute the topological complexity of equilibria, which quantifies how rapidly the number of equilibria of the dynamical equations grows with the total number of species. We perform the calculation for arbitrary degree of non-reciprocity in the interactions, distinguishing between configurations that are dynamically stable to invasions by species absent from the equilibrium, and those that are not. We characterize the properties of typical (i.e., most numerous) equilibria at a given diversity, including their average abundance, mutual similarity, and internal stability. This analysis reveals the existence of two distinct ME phases, which differ in how internally stable equilibria behave under invasions by absent species. We discuss the implications of this finding for the system's dynamical behavior.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用大型语言模型（LLMs）直接从临床入院记录预测卒中后功能结局的可行性，发现经过微调的LLM性能可与需要结构化数据的传统模型相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 既往关于改良Rankin量表（mRS）预测的研究主要依赖结构化变量和传统机器学习方法，但LLM直接从常规入院记录推断结局的能力尚未被充分探索，这有望实现无需人工数据提取的临床工作流无缝整合。

Method: 评估了编码器（BERT、NYUTron）和生成式（Llama-3.1-8B、MedGemma-4B）LLM在冻结和微调设置下的表现，使用9,485份出院结局和1,898份90天结局的入院记录，采用时间分割法，以最近12个月数据作为测试集。通过精确7分类mRS准确率和二分类功能结局准确率评估性能，并与基于NIHSS和年龄的结构化数据基线进行比较。

Result: 微调后的Llama-3.1-8B表现最佳：90天精确mRS准确率33.9%，二分类准确率76.3%；出院预测精确准确率42.0%，二分类准确率75.0%。对于90天预测，Llama性能与结构化数据基线相当。

Conclusion: 微调后的LLM能够仅从入院记录预测卒中后功能结局，性能与需要结构化变量的模型相当，支持开发无需人工数据提取、可无缝集成到临床工作流的文本基础预后工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke can inform clinical decision-making and resource allocation. Prior work on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) prediction has relied primarily on structured variables (e.g., age, NIHSS) and conventional machine learning. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer future mRS scores directly from routine admission notes remains largely unexplored. We evaluated encoder (BERT, NYUTron) and generative (Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) LLMs, in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, for discharge and 90-day mRS prediction using a large, real-world stroke registry. The discharge outcome dataset included 9,485 History and Physical notes and the 90-day outcome dataset included 1,898 notes from the NYU Langone Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry (2016-2025). Data were temporally split with the most recent 12 months held out for testing. Performance was assessed using exact (7-class) mRS accuracy and binary functional outcome (mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6) accuracy and compared against established structured-data baselines incorporating NIHSS and age. Fine-tuned Llama achieved the highest performance, with 90-day exact mRS accuracy of 33.9% [95% CI, 27.9-39.9%] and binary accuracy of 76.3% [95% CI, 70.7-81.9%]. Discharge performance reached 42.0% [95% CI, 39.0-45.0%] exact accuracy and 75.0% [95% CI, 72.4-77.6%] binary accuracy. For 90-day prediction, Llama performed comparably to structured-data baselines. Fine-tuned LLMs can predict post-stroke functional outcomes from admission notes alone, achieving performance comparable to models requiring structured variable abstraction. Our findings support the development of text-based prognostic tools that integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows without manual data extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between competition-level AI math problem-solving (e.g., IMO gold medal) and professional mathematical research, which requires navigating vast literature and constructing long-horizon proofs.

Method: An iterative system combining advanced reasoning (Gemini Deep Think), novel inference-time scaling laws extending beyond Olympiad problems, and intensive tool use to generate, verify, and revise solutions end-to-end in natural language.

Result: Achieved milestones: (a) fully autonomous research paper on eigenweights in arithmetic geometry; (b) human-AI collaborative paper on bounds for independent set systems; (c) semi-autonomous evaluation of 700 open problems with solutions to four open questions on Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database.

Conclusion: Demonstrates significant progress toward autonomous mathematical research, proposes codifying standard levels for quantifying AI autonomy/novelty, and reflects on the evolving role of human-AI collaboration in mathematics.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational models have yielded reasoning systems capable of achieving a gold-medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad. The transition from competition-level problem-solving to professional research, however, requires navigating vast literature and constructing long-horizon proofs. In this work, we introduce Aletheia, a math research agent that iteratively generates, verifies, and revises solutions end-to-end in natural language. Specifically, Aletheia is powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for challenging reasoning problems, a novel inference-time scaling law that extends beyond Olympiad-level problems, and intensive tool use to navigate the complexities of mathematical research. We demonstrate the capability of Aletheia from Olympiad problems to PhD-level exercises and most notably, through several distinct milestones in AI-assisted mathematics research: (a) a research paper (Feng26) generated by AI without any human intervention in calculating certain structure constants in arithmetic geometry called eigenweights; (b) a research paper (LeeSeo26) demonstrating human-AI collaboration in proving bounds on systems of interacting particles called independent sets; and (c) an extensive semi-autonomous evaluation (Feng et al., 2026a) of 700 open problems on Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database, including autonomous solutions to four open questions. In order to help the public better understand the developments pertaining to AI and mathematics, we suggest codifying standard levels quantifying autonomy and novelty of AI-assisted results. We conclude with reflections on human-AI collaboration in mathematics.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a neural-network construction of Euclidean scalar quantum field theories from transformer attention heads, defining $n$-point correlators by averaging over random network parameters in the NN-QFT framework. For a single attention head, shared random softmax weights couple different width coordinates and induce non-Gaussian field statistics that persist in the infinite-width limit $d_k\to\infty$. We compute the two-point function in an attention-weight representation and show how Euclidean-invariant kernels can be engineered via random-feature token embeddings. We then analyze the connected four-point function and identify an "independence-breaking" contribution, expressible as a covariance over query-key weights, which remains finite at infinite width. Finally, we show that summing many independent heads with standard $1/N_h$ normalization suppresses connected non-Gaussian correlators as $1/N_h$, yielding a Gaussian NN-QFT in the large-head limit.

TL;DR: Proposes two kernel-based metrics (Sig-MMD and CSig-MMD) for probabilistic forecasting evaluation that capture dependencies and prioritize tail events while maintaining properness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current probabilistic forecasting evaluation frameworks lack consensus metrics and suffer from assuming independence across time/variables and being insensitive to critical tail events.

Method: Proposes signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and a novel censored version (CSig-MMD) using signature kernels to capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies, with CSig-MMD adding a censoring scheme to prioritize tail event prediction.

Result: Metrics capture dependencies, robust to missing data, maintain properness, and enable reliable evaluation of direct multi-step forecasting.

Conclusion: These metrics facilitate development of more robust probabilistic algorithms for high-stakes domains like finance, epidemiology, and climate science.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is increasingly critical across high-stakes domains, from finance and epidemiology to climate science. However, current evaluation frameworks lack a consensus metric and suffer from two critical flaws: they often assume independence across time steps or variables, and they demonstrably lack sensitivity to tail events, the very occurrences that are most pivotal in real-world decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). By leveraging the signature kernel, these metrics capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and remain robust to missing data. Furthermore, CSig-MMD introduces a censoring scheme that prioritizes a forecaster's capability to predict tail events while strictly maintaining properness, a vital property for a good scoring rule. These metrics enable a more reliable evaluation of direct multi-step forecasting, facilitating the development of more robust probabilistic algorithms.

Conclusion: 统计学习视角为理解PINNs提供了新框架，物理约束等价于无限数据源，该理论分析有助于改进PINNs的可靠性评估和预测性能。

Abstract: We study the training and performance of physics-informed learning for initial and boundary value problems (IBVP) with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from a statistical learning perspective. Specifically, we restrict ourselves to parameterizations with hard initial and boundary condition constraints and reformulate the problem of estimating PINN parameters as a statistical learning problem. From this perspective, the physics penalty on the IBVP residuals can be better understood not as a regularizing term bus as an infinite source of indirect data, and the learning process as fitting the PINN distribution of residuals $p(y \mid x, t, w) q(x, t) $ to the true data-generating distribution $δ(0) q(x, t)$ by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and PINN distributions. Furthermore, this analysis show that physics-informed learning with PINNs is a singular learning problem, and we employ singular learning theory tools, namely the so-called Local Learning Coefficient (Lau et al., 2025) to analyze the estimates of PINN parameters obtained via stochastic optimization for a heat equation IBVP. Finally, we discuss implications of this analysis on the quantification of predictive uncertainty of PINNs and the extrapolation capacity of PINNs.

*Francisco Patitucci,Aryan Mokhtari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MVN-Grad is a novel optimizer that decouples variance normalization and momentum operations to reduce update variance, improve stability, and enhance performance in deep learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Adam-style optimizers suffer from cross-time coupling between stale momentum and stochastic normalizers, causing instability. The need to address robustness to outliers and sign-type collapse in low-variance regimes motivated this research.

Method: Introduced MVN-Grad which scales gradients by exponential moving averages of gradient uncertainty (variance-based normalization) then applies momentum to the normalized gradients, eliminating coupling between momentum and normalization operations.

Result: Proved 1) strictly smaller one-step conditional update variance than momentum-then-normalize methods, 2) uniformly bounded response to gradient spikes, 3) avoidance of sign-type collapse and accelerated convergence in low-variance regimes, and 4) empirical superiority over Adam, AdaBelief, and LaProp on CIFAR-100 and GPT-style language modeling.

Conclusion: MVN-Grad provides a more stable, robust, and efficient optimization algorithm for deep learning that delivers smoother training and better generalization without computational overhead.

Abstract: We introduce MVN-Grad (Momentum on Variance-Normalized Gradients), an Adam-style optimizer that improves stability and performance by combining two complementary ideas: variance-based normalization and momentum applied after normalization. MVN-Grad scales each coordinate by an exponential moving average of gradient uncertainty and applies momentum to the resulting normalized gradients, eliminating the cross-time coupling between stale momentum and a stochastic normalizer present in standard Adam-type updates. We prove that this decoupling yields strictly smaller one-step conditional update variance than momentum-then-normalize variance methods under standard noise assumptions, and that MVN-Grad is robust to outliers: it has a uniformly bounded response to single gradient spikes.
  In low-variance regimes, we further show variance normalization avoids sign-type collapse associated with second-moment scaling and can yield accelerated convergence. Across CIFAR-100 image classification and GPT-style language modeling benchmarks, MVN-Grad matches or outperforms Adam, AdaBelief, and LaProp, delivering smoother training and improved generalization with no added overhead.

Conclusion: HybridRAG-Bench为评估可随模型和知识演进的混合知识增强推理系统提供了原则性、可定制的基准测试方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with knowledge-intensive questions that require up-to-date information and multi-hop reasoning. Augmenting LLMs with hybrid external knowledge, such as unstructured text and structured knowledge graphs, offers a promising alternative to costly continual pretraining. As such, reliable evaluation of their retrieval and reasoning capabilities becomes critical. However, many existing benchmarks increasingly overlap with LLM pretraining data, which means answers or supporting knowledge may already be encoded in model parameters, making it difficult to distinguish genuine retrieval and reasoning from parametric recall. We introduce HybridRAG-Bench, a framework for constructing benchmarks to evaluate retrieval-intensive, multi-hop reasoning over hybrid knowledge. HybridRAG-Bench automatically couples unstructured text and structured knowledge graph representations derived from recent scientific literature on arXiv, and generates knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths. The framework supports flexible domain and time-frame selection, enabling contamination-aware and customizable evaluation as models and knowledge evolve. Experiments across three domains (artificial intelligence, governance and policy, and bioinformatics) demonstrate that HybridRAG-Bench rewards genuine retrieval and reasoning rather than parametric recall, offering a principled testbed for evaluating hybrid knowledge-augmented reasoning systems. We release our code and data at github.com/junhongmit/HybridRAG-Bench.

*Michael Rushka,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) from a dynamical systems perspective, establishing explicit mathematical relationships between the rank of LoRA updates and model accuracy for different loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LoRA empirically performs well even at low ranks, the theoretical understanding of how its accuracy depends on update rank remains unexplored. This work aims to fill that gap by analyzing LoRA through gradient flow and dynamical systems theory.

Method: The authors perform gradient flow analysis in both full-rank and low-rank regimes, deriving rigorous dynamical system equations for LoRA updates. They then use these equations to obtain closed-form relationships between LoRA rank and accuracy for trace-squared and Frobenius-norm low-rank approximation loss functions.

Result: The paper derives that gradient flow equations for LoRA are identical for simultaneous and sequential parameter updates. It establishes explicit mathematical relationships showing how accuracy varies with rank for different loss functions under LoRA fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The work provides the first theoretical framework that quantitatively links LoRA's update rank to its fine-tuning accuracy, offering mathematical insights into why LoRA works well even at very low ranks.

Abstract: Previous empirical studies have shown that LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full-parameter methods on downstream fine-tuning tasks, even for rank-1 updates. By contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of the dependence of LoRA's accuracy on update rank remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we compare the accuracy of rank-r LoRA updates against full-parameter updates for fine-tuning tasks from a dynamical systems perspective. We perform gradient flow analysis in both full-rank and low-rank regimes to establish explicit relationships between rank and accuracy for two loss functions under LoRA. While gradient flow equations for LoRA are presented in prior work, we rigorously derive their form and show that they are identical for simultaneous and sequential LoRA parameter updates. We then use the resulting dynamical system equations to obtain closed-form relationships between LoRA rank and accuracy for trace-squared and Frobenius-norm low-rank approximation loss functions.

Conclusion: 本框架通过在输入嵌入空间解缠语义方向，实现了对扩散模型输出的精确控制，解决了模式崩溃问题，并为评估概念复杂度提供了新指标。

Abstract: A single text prompt passed to a diffusion model often yields a wide range of visual outputs determined solely by stochastic process, leaving users with no direct control over which specific semantic variations appear in the image. While existing unsupervised methods attempt to analyze these variations via output features, they omit the underlying generative process. In this work, we propose a framework to disentangle these semantic directions directly within the input embedding space. To that end, we collect a set of gradients obtained by backpropagating the differences between stochastic realizations of a fixed prompt that we later decompose into meaningful steering directions with either Principal Components Analysis or Sparse Autoencoder. Our approach yields three key contributions: (1) it isolates interpretable, steerable directions for precise, fine-grained control over a single concept; (2) it effectively mitigates mode collapse in distilled models by reintroducing lost diversity; and (3) it establishes a novel estimator for concept complexity under a specific model, based on the dimensionality of the discovered subspace.

Method: 1）将遗忘任务重构为密度比估计问题；2）冻结基础模型，采用两阶段推理：先退火平滑高置信度峰值，再用轻量分类器倾斜调整分布

Result: 理论证明退火对集中分布遗忘的必要性；在TOFU基准上，遗忘质量和生成效用优于基线，仅训练少量参数且运行时短

Conclusion: T3-Unlearning为大型生成模型提供了一种高效可靠的机器遗忘解决方案，特别适用于处理集中分布的遗忘数据

Abstract: We study machine unlearning in large generative models by framing the task as density ratio estimation to a target distribution rather than supervised fine-tuning. While classifier guidance is a standard approach for approximating this ratio and can succeed in general, we show it can fail to faithfully unlearn with finite samples when the forget set represents a sharp, concentrated data distribution. To address this, we introduce Temper-Then-Tilt Unlearning (T3-Unlearning), which freezes the base model and applies a two-step inference procedure: (i) tempering the base distribution to flatten high-confidence spikes, and (ii) tilting the tempered distribution using a lightweight classifier trained to distinguish retain from forget samples. Our theoretical analysis provides finite-sample guarantees linking the surrogate classifier's risk to unlearning error, proving that tempering is necessary to successfully unlearn for concentrated distributions. Empirical evaluations on the TOFU benchmark show that T3-Unlearning improves forget quality and generative utility over existing baselines, while training only a fraction of the parameters with a minimal runtime.

TL;DR: 该论文提出元经验学习（MEL）框架，通过从LLM推理错误中提取可复用的知识并内化到参数记忆中，解决RLVR的元学习瓶颈问题，实现约4%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR缺乏错误归因和经验内化机制，限制了细粒度信用分配和可复用知识形成，阻碍了LLM推理能力的进一步提升。

Method: 基于标准RLVR，引入LLM自验证能力对正确/错误轨迹进行对比分析，识别推理错误产生的精确分岔点，将其总结为可泛化的元经验，并通过最小化负对数似然将元经验内化到LLM参数记忆中，形成语言建模奖励信号。

Result: 在各项基准测试中实现3.92%-4.73%的Pass@1增益，且在不同模型规模上均表现一致改进。

Conclusion: MEL成功弥合了RLVR的元学习鸿沟，通过从错误中实现有效知识复用，为提升LLM推理能力提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its efficacy, RLVR faces a meta-learning bottleneck: it lacks mechanisms for error attribution and experience internalization intrinsic to the human learning cycle beyond practice and verification, thereby limiting fine-grained credit assignment and reusable knowledge formation. We term such reusable knowledge representations derived from past errors as meta-experience. Based on this insight, we propose Meta-Experience Learning (MEL), a novel framework that incorporates self-distilled meta-experience into the model's parametric memory. Building upon standard RLVR, we introduce an additional design that leverages the LLM's self-verification capability to conduct contrastive analysis on paired correct and incorrect trajectories, identify the precise bifurcation points where reasoning errors arise, and summarize them into generalizable meta-experience. The meta-experience is further internalized into the LLM's parametric memory by minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which induces a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories and facilitates effective knowledge reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that MEL achieves consistent improvements on benchmarks, yielding 3.92%--4.73% Pass@1 gains across varying model sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-evolving system using Google's Gemini LLMs to autonomously optimize large-scale recommendation models at YouTube, combining offline hypothesis generation with online validation, outperforming traditional manual engineering workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing large-scale machine learning systems like video platform recommendations is extremely challenging due to massive hyperparameter spaces and the need for sophisticated optimizers/architectures/reward functions. Traditional approaches rely heavily on slow, manual iterations by human engineers.

Method: Proposed an LLM-driven self-evolving system with two specialized agents: an Offline Agent (Inner Loop) that performs high-throughput hypothesis generation using proxy metrics, and an Online Agent (Outer Loop) that validates candidates against delayed business metrics in live production. The LLMs act as expert ML engineers, reasoning to discover novel improvements in optimization algorithms, model architectures, and reward functions.

Result: Achieved several successful production launches at YouTube, demonstrating that the autonomous LLM-driven approach surpassed traditional engineering workflows in both development speed and model performance.

Conclusion: LLM-driven autonomous evolution is effective for optimizing large-scale ML systems, offering superior development velocity and performance compared to manual iteration processes, as validated through real-world production deployments.

Abstract: Optimizing large-scale machine learning systems, such as recommendation models for global video platforms, requires navigating a massive hyperparameter search space and, more critically, designing sophisticated optimizers, architectures, and reward functions to capture nuanced user behaviors. Achieving substantial improvements in these areas is a non-trivial task, traditionally relying on extensive manual iterations to test new hypotheses. We propose a self-evolving system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically those from Google's Gemini family, to autonomously generate, train, and deploy high-performing, complex model changes within an end-to-end automated workflow. The self-evolving system is comprised of an Offline Agent (Inner Loop) that performs high-throughput hypothesis generation using proxy metrics, and an Online Agent (Outer Loop) that validates candidates against delayed north star business metrics in live production. Our agents act as specialized Machine Learning Engineers (MLEs): they exhibit deep reasoning capabilities, discovering novel improvements in optimization algorithms and model architecture, and formulating innovative reward functions that target long-term user engagement. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through several successful production launches at YouTube, confirming that autonomous, LLM-driven evolution can surpass traditional engineering workflows in both development velocity and model performance.

### [82] [Frame-Level Internal Tool Use for Temporal Grounding in Audio LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10230)
*Joesph An,Phillip Keung,Jiaqi Wang,Orevaoghene Ahia,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a frame-level internal tool use method that trains audio language models to perform temporal grounding directly using their internal audio representations, achieving >50x speedup and robust length generalization compared to token-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large audio language models struggle with temporal tasks requiring precise grounding (word alignment, speaker diarization) due to computational cost and hallucination issues with token-based timestamp generation, especially for audio lengths outside training distribution.

Method: Frame-level internal tool use: training audio LMs to use their own internal audio representations directly via a lightweight prediction mechanism with a binary frame classifier and novel inhomogeneous Poisson process (IHP) loss for temporal event intensity modeling.

Result: Outperforms token-based baselines across word localization, speaker diarization, and event localization tasks; achieves >50x inference speedup; maintains high accuracy on out-of-distribution audio durations where standard models completely fail.

Conclusion: Directly using internal audio representations for temporal grounding is more efficient and robust than generating timestamps as text tokens, enabling significant performance improvements and length generalization for audio understanding tasks.

Abstract: Large audio language models are increasingly used for complex audio understanding tasks, but they struggle with temporal tasks that require precise temporal grounding, such as word alignment and speaker diarization. The standard approach, where we generate timestamps as sequences of text tokens, is computationally expensive and prone to hallucination, especially when processing audio lengths outside the model's training distribution. In this work, we propose frame-level internal tool use, a method that trains audio LMs to use their own internal audio representations to perform temporal grounding directly. We introduce a lightweight prediction mechanism trained via two objectives: a binary frame classifier and a novel inhomogeneous Poisson process (IHP) loss that models temporal event intensity. Across word localization, speaker diarization, and event localization tasks, our approach outperforms token-based baselines. Most notably, it achieves a >50x inference speedup and demonstrates robust length generalization, maintaining high accuracy on out-of-distribution audio durations where standard token-based models collapse completely.

*Kirill Pavlenko,Alexander Golubev,Simon Karasik,Boris Yangel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文针对GRPO在结构化生成中为所有token分配单一优势值导致的目标干扰和信用分配错误问题，提出了Blockwise Advantage Estimation方法，通过为不同文本块分配独立优势并使用结果条件基线来避免昂贵的嵌套rollouts。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在结构化生成中，GRPO为完成序列的所有token分配单个标量优势，这会将不同段的无关奖励信号耦合在一起，导致目标干扰和错误的信用分配。

Method: 提出Blockwise Advantage Estimation，为每个目标分配独立的优势值并仅应用于对应文本块；核心创新是引入Outcome-Conditioned Baseline，通过按前缀衍生中间结果分层采样，仅用组内统计量近似中间状态价值，避免嵌套rollouts。

Result: 在带不确定性估计的数学任务上，该方法减轻了奖励干扰，性能可与最先进的奖励设计方法相媲美，并保留了置信度加权集成的测试时增益。

Conclusion: 提供了一种无需额外rollouts即可优化结构化生成中序贯目标的模块化方案，可自然地扩展到更多目标，减少对手工设计标量奖励的依赖。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) assigns a single scalar advantage to all tokens in a completion. For structured generations with explicit segments and objectives, this couples unrelated reward signals across segments, leading to objective interference and misattributed credit. We propose Blockwise Advantage Estimation, a family of GRPO-compatible methods that assigns each objective its own advantage and applies it only to the tokens in the corresponding text block, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives. A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to a prefix-derived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling. More broadly, it provides a modular recipe for optimizing sequential objectives in structured generations without additional rollouts.

*Amir Asiaee,Chao Yan,Zachary B. Abrams,Bradley A. Malin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出风险均衡差分隐私合成框架，通过两阶段方法在生成合成数据时保护异常值：先用少量隐私预算计算每条记录的"异常程度"风险评分，再在差分隐私训练中按评分反比加权，显著降低对高风险个体的成员推断攻击成功率，同时保持严格的隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准差分隐私对所有记录一视同仁，但异常值（罕见病患者、异常交易）天生更容易受到成员推断攻击。最坏情况下的差分隐私保证无法为这些高风险个体提供充分保护，特别是在中等隐私预算和攻击者拥有辅助信息时，造成保护不公的差异。

Method: 论文提出两阶段风险均衡框架：（1）使用少量隐私预算计算每条记录的"异常程度"风险评分；（2）在差分隐私合成过程中，按评分反比加权，降低异常值对生成器的影响。该方法利用高斯机制中隐私损失与记录影响力成正比的特点，为高风险记录实现更严格的逐实例隐私边界。

Result: 在注入异常值的模拟数据上，该方法显著降低了对高异常度记录的成员推断攻击成功率。消融实验证实改进源于目标性降权而非随机降权。在真实基准数据集（乳腺癌、Adult、德国信用）上，增益取决于数据集特性，显示效果与风险评分质量和合成管道集成度密切相关。

Conclusion: 风险均衡差分隐私合成通过优先保护易受攻击的异常值，成功重新平衡了隐私保护，在保持形式化差分隐私保证的同时，显著提升了对成员推断攻击的经验防御。该框架证明逐实例隐私边界可以在最需要的场景中收紧，尽管实际效果取决于评分器质量和数据集特征。

Abstract: When synthetic data is released, some individuals are harder to protect than others. A patient with a rare disease combination or a transaction with unusual characteristics stands out from the crowd. Differential privacy provides worst-case guarantees, but empirical attacks -- particularly membership inference -- succeed far more often against such outliers, especially under moderate privacy budgets and with auxiliary information.
  This paper introduces risk-equalized DP synthesis, a framework that prioritizes protection for high-risk records by reducing their influence on the learned generator. The mechanism operates in two stages: first, a small privacy budget estimates each record's "outlierness"; second, a DP learning procedure weights each record inversely to its risk score. Under Gaussian mechanisms, a record's privacy loss is proportional to its influence on the output -- so deliberately shrinking outliers' contributions yields tighter per-instance privacy bounds for precisely those records that need them most.
  We prove end-to-end DP guarantees via composition and derive closed-form per-record bounds for the synthesis stage (the scoring stage adds a uniform per-record term). Experiments on simulated data with controlled outlier injection show that risk-weighting substantially reduces membership inference success against high-outlierness records; ablations confirm that targeting -- not random downweighting -- drives the improvement. On real-world benchmarks (Breast Cancer, Adult, German Credit), gains are dataset-dependent, highlighting the interplay between scorer quality and synthesis pipeline.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a context-aware recommender system that models students' programming skills using embeddings of the source code they submit throughout a course. These embeddings predict students' skills across multiple programming topics, producing profiles that are matched to the skills required by unseen homework problems. To generate recommendations, we compute the cosine similarity between student profiles and problem skill vectors, ranking exercises according to their alignment with each student's current abilities. We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings. Our approach consistently produced more suitable recommendations than baselines based on correctness or solution time, indicating that predicted programming skills provide a stronger signal for problem recommendation.

Motivation: 单核方法受限于单一核函数，难以充分表征现实世界数据的异质性和多面性。多核学习虽可通过组合核函数缓解此问题，但传统MKL主要针对连续型结果变量，对指数族等更广泛的数据类型支持不足。

Method: 提出GLIMARK（Generalized Linear Models with Integrated Multiple Additive Regression with Kernels），将多核学习框架扩展至指数族分布的结果变量，使其能处理二分类、计数等更广泛的数据类型。

Result: 实证研究表明GLIMARK能有效恢复或逼近真实数据生成机制。在COVID-19胸部X光片数据应用中，成功预测ICU升级的二分类结局并提取临床可解释的特征。

Conclusion: GLIMARK为实际应用场景，特别是医疗健康领域的复杂数据分析提供了实用工具，证明了多核学习在处理多样化结果类型问题中的有效性。

Abstract: Kernel methods have been extensively utilized in machine learning for classification and prediction tasks due to their ability to capture complex non-linear data patterns. However, single kernel approaches are inherently limited, as they rely on a single type of kernel function (e.g., Gaussian kernel), which may be insufficient to fully represent the heterogeneity or multifaceted nature of real-world data. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) addresses these limitations by constructing composite kernels from simpler ones and integrating information from heterogeneous sources. Despite these advances, traditional MKL methods are primarily designed for continuous outcomes. We extend MKL to accommodate the outcome variable belonging to the exponential family, representing a broader variety of data types, and refer to our proposed method as generalized linear models with integrated multiple additive regression with kernels (GLIMARK). Empirically, we demonstrate that GLIMARK can effectively recover or approximate the true data-generating mechanism. We have applied it to a COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, predicting binary outcomes of ICU escalation and extracting clinically meaningful features, underscoring the practical utility of this approach in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Linear-LLM-SCM, a benchmarking framework to evaluate LLMs' ability to perform quantitative causal reasoning by estimating effect sizes in linear Gaussian structural causal models, revealing significant challenges including high stochasticity, sensitivity to DAG misspecification, and substantial variability in coefficient estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show promise in identifying qualitative causal relationships, their capability for quantitative causal reasoning—specifically estimating continuous effect sizes that parametrize functional relationships—remains largely unexplored and untested.

Method: The framework decomposes a given DAG into local parent-child sets, prompts an LLM to generate regression-style structural equations for each node, aggregates these outputs, and compares them against ground-truth parameters to benchmark performance.

Result: Experiments reveal several key challenges: strong stochasticity in model outputs, susceptibility to DAG misspecification through spurious edges, substantial variability in coefficient estimates across different settings, and high sensitivity to structural and semantic perturbations.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant current limitations of LLMs as quantitative causal parameterizers, demonstrating that their reliability and consistency in estimating causal effect sizes remains questionable despite their qualitative causal reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in identifying qualitative causal relations, but their ability to perform quantitative causal reasoning -- estimating effect sizes that parametrize functional relationships -- remains underexplored in continuous domains. We introduce Linear-LLM-SCM, a plug-and-play benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs on linear Gaussian structural causal model (SCM) parametrization when the DAG is given. The framework decomposes a DAG into local parent-child sets and prompts an LLM to produce a regression-style structural equation per node, which is aggregated and compared against available ground-truth parameters. Our experiments show several challenges in such benchmarking tasks, namely, strong stochasticity in the results in some of the models and susceptibility to DAG misspecification via spurious edges in the continuous domains. Across models, we observe substantial variability in coefficient estimates for some settings and sensitivity to structural and semantic perturbations, highlighting current limitations of LLMs as quantitative causal parameterizers. We also open-sourced the benchmarking framework so that researchers can utilize their DAGs and any off-the-shelf LLMs plug-and-play for evaluation in their domains effortlessly.

Conclusion: NCPL突破传统扩展定律对最优超参数的依赖，为复杂训练配置提供高精度预测工具，推动大规模训练调优效率提升

Abstract: Researchers build scaling laws to forecast the training performance of expensive large-scale runs with larger model size N and data size D. These laws assume that other training hyperparameters are optimally chosen, which can require significant effort and, in some cases, be impossible due to external hardware constraints. To improve predictability across a broader set of hyperparameters and enable simpler tuning at scale, we propose learning a \textit{Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law} (CPL): a mapping from the \textit{full training configuration} to training performance. Because no simple functional form can express this mapping, we parameterize it with a large language model (LLM), and fit it with diverse open-source pretraining logs across multiple sources, yielding a \textit{Neural} Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law (NCPL). NCPL accurately predicts how training configurations influence the final pretraining loss, achieving 20-40% lower prediction error than the configuration-agnostic Chinchilla law and generalizing to runs using up to 10 x more compute than any run in the training set. It further supports joint tuning of multiple hyperparameters with performance comparable to hyperparameter scaling law baselines. Finally, NCPL naturally and effectively extends to richer prediction targets such as loss-curve prediction.

Abstract: Reward shaping has been applied widely to accelerate Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents' training. However, a principled way of designing effective reward shaping functions, especially for complex continuous control problems, remains largely under-explained. In this work, we propose to automatically learn a reward shaping function for continuous control problems from offline datasets, potentially contaminated by unobserved confounding variables. Specifically, our method builds upon the recently proposed causal Bellman equation to learn a tight upper bound on the optimal state values, which is then used as the potentials in the Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) framework. Our proposed reward shaping algorithm is tested with Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) on multiple commonly used continuous control benchmarks and exhibits strong performance guarantees under unobserved confounders. More broadly, our work marks a solid first step towards confounding robust continuous control from a causal perspective.

Motivation: 开发一种无需任务特定训练即可实现风暴后财产损失实时预测的框架，同时提供可解释的结构化推理过程，解决传统有监督方法需要大量标注数据和缺乏解释性的问题。

Method: 基于有监督表格预测器构建推理中心知识库，包含结构化预测变量、文本摘要和模型生成推理轨迹；推断时检索地理邻近样本和典型类别原型的推理轨迹，通过两阶段流程（先判断损失发生再细化严重程度）并加入条件降级步骤来校正过度预测。

Conclusion: 该框架以零训练成本接近有监督性能，同时提供结构化推理依据，展现出极高的实用部署价值，为灾害损失预测提供了可解释且经济高效的新范式。

Abstract: R2RAG-Flood is a reasoning-reinforced, training-free retrieval-augmented generation framework for post-storm property damage nowcasting. Building on an existing supervised tabular predictor, the framework constructs a reasoning-centric knowledge base composed of labeled tabular records, where each sample includes structured predictors, a compact natural language text-mode summary, and a model-generated reasoning trajectory. During inference, R2RAG-Flood issues context-augmented prompts that retrieve and condition on relevant reasoning trajectories from nearby geospatial neighbors and canonical class prototypes, enabling the large language model backbone to emulate and adapt prior reasoning rather than learn new task-specific parameters. Predictions follow a two-stage procedure that first determines property damage occurrence and then refines severity within a three-level Property Damage Extent categorization, with a conditional downgrade step to correct over-predicted severity. In a case study of Harris County, Texas at the 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale, the supervised tabular baseline trained directly on structured predictors achieves 0.714 overall accuracy and 0.859 damage class accuracy for medium and high damage classes. Across seven large language model backbones, R2RAG-Flood attains 0.613 to 0.668 overall accuracy and 0.757 to 0.896 damage class accuracy, approaching the supervised baseline while additionally producing a structured rationale for each prediction. Using a severity-per-cost efficiency metric derived from API pricing and GPU instance costs, lightweight R2RAG-Flood variants demonstrate substantially higher efficiency than both the supervised tabular baseline and larger language models, while requiring no task-specific training or fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDMs在训练时需要处理指数级增长的掩码模式，计算开销大，且训练时使用的随机掩码与推理时的结构化掩码存在不匹配问题。

Method: 提出Progressive UnMAsking (PUMA)，通过修改前向掩码过程来对齐训练和推理时的掩码模式。

Conclusion: PUMA简单有效地解决了MDMs的训练效率问题，显著加速训练并减少训练-推理差异，代码已开源。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete spaces. By generating sequences in any order and allowing for parallel decoding, they enable fast inference and strong performance on non-causal tasks. However, this flexibility comes with a training complexity trade-off: MDMs train on an exponentially large set of masking patterns, which is not only computationally expensive, but also creates a train--test mismatch between the random masks used in training and the highly structured masks induced by inference-time unmasking. In this work, we propose Progressive UnMAsking (PUMA), a simple modification of the forward masking process that aligns training-time and inference-time masking patterns, thereby focusing optimization on inference-aligned masks and speeding up training. Empirically, PUMA speeds up pretraining at the 125M scale by $\approx 2.5\times$ and offers complementary advantages on top of common recipes like autoregressive initialization. We open-source our codebase at https://github.com/JaeyeonKim01/PUMA.

TL;DR: 提出LITT新型时序Transformer架构，通过将患者事件对齐到虚拟相对时间轴，实现事件时序注意力机制，有效发现个性化序贯模式，并在乳腺癌患者心脏毒性预测中显著优于现有生存分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大规模时序数据中自动发现个性化序贯事件对精准医疗至关重要，但现有AI模型（如transformer）对事件时序和顺序不敏感，忽略了潜在因果推理。需要评估患者轨迹对齐度并识别共享模式，将时间作为可计算维度，为事件分配超越实际观测的相对时间戳。

Method: LITT时序Transformer架构：在虚拟"相对时间轴"上临时对齐序贯事件，实现事件时序注意力机制，支持对临床轨迹的个性化解释和因果推理。

Result: 在3,276名乳腺癌患者真实世界纵向EHR数据上验证，成功预测心脏毒性所致心脏病发作时间；在公开数据集上性能超越基准及现有最优生存分析方法。

Conclusion: LITT为临床AI精准医疗提供了重要技术突破，通过显式建模事件时序关系，显著提升了个性化事件发现与预测能力。

Abstract: Automatically discovering personalized sequential events from large-scale time-series data is crucial for enabling precision medicine in clinical research, yet it remains a formidable challenge even for contemporary AI models. For example, while transformers capture rich associations, they are mostly agnostic to event timing and ordering, thereby bypassing potential causal reasoning.
  Intuitively, we need a method capable of evaluating the "degree of alignment" among patient-specific trajectories and identifying their shared patterns, i.e., the significant events in a consistent sequence. This necessitates treating timing as a true \emph{computable} dimension, allowing models to assign ``relative timestamps'' to candidate events beyond their observed physical times.
  In this work, we introduce LITT, a novel Timing-Transformer architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual ``relative timeline'', thereby enabling \emph{event-timing-focused attention} and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories. Its interpretability and effectiveness are validated on real-world longitudinal EHR data from 3,276 breast cancer patients to predict the onset timing of cardiotoxicity-induced heart disease. Furthermore, LITT outperforms both the benchmark and state-of-the-art survival analysis methods on public datasets, positioning it as a significant step forward for precision medicine in clinical AI.

### [93] [Theoretical Analysis of Contrastive Learning under Imbalanced Data: From Training Dynamics to a Pruning Solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10357)
*Haixu Liao,Yating Zhou,Songyang Zhang,Meng Wang,Shuai Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of how contrastive learning with Transformer encoders behaves under imbalanced data distributions, revealing three-stage training dynamics and showing that pruning can mitigate performance degradation caused by minority features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The theoretical understanding of contrastive learning is limited, especially under imbalanced data distributions that are common in real-world applications. Imbalanced data can degrade representation quality and cause biased model behavior, but there lacks a rigorous characterization of these effects.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework to analyze training dynamics of contrastive learning with Transformer-based encoders under imbalanced data conditions.

Result: (1) Neuron weights evolve through three distinct stages of training with different dynamics for majority features, minority features, and noise. (2) Minority features reduce representational capacity, require more complex architectures, and hinder separation of ground-truth features from noise. (3) Pruning can restore performance degraded by imbalance and enhance feature separation.

Conclusion: The theoretical findings provide both conceptual insights into the neuron-level behaviors of contrastive learning under data imbalance and practical guidance for improving model performance through pruning techniques.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful framework for learning generalizable representations, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited, particularly under imbalanced data distributions that are prevalent in real-world applications. Such an imbalance can degrade representation quality and induce biased model behavior, yet a rigorous characterization of these effects is lacking. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the training dynamics of contrastive learning with Transformer-based encoders under imbalanced data. Our results reveal that neuron weights evolve through three distinct stages of training, with different dynamics for majority features, minority features, and noise. We further show that minority features reduce representational capacity, increase the need for more complex architectures, and hinder the separation of ground-truth features from noise. Inspired by these neuron-level behaviors, we show that pruning restores performance degraded by imbalance and enhances feature separation, offering both conceptual insights and practical guidance. Major theoretical findings are validated through numerical experiments.

Motivation: 完整世界模型过于复杂，直接使用大型预训练模型进行搜索效率低下且不准确。部分模型专注于通过实现用户意图的可供性来预测状态和动作子集，但尚不清楚大型模型是否可充当部分世界模型。

Method: 提供形式化理论分析，证明任务无关的语言条件化智能体必然拥有基于可供性的预测性部分世界模型；针对多任务设置引入分布鲁棒可供性，并在桌面机器人任务中进行实证评估。

Result: 理论证明部分模型对智能体的必要性；实证结果显示，感知可供性的部分模型相比完整世界模型能降低搜索分支因子并获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: 大型模型确实可以视为部分世界模型，这种视角通过关注与用户意图相关的可供性，能够实现更高效、更优性能的搜索，尤其在多任务场景下引入分布鲁棒可供性可进一步提升效果。

Abstract: Full models of the world require complex knowledge of immense detail. While pre-trained large models have been hypothesized to contain similar knowledge due to extensive pre-training on vast amounts of internet scale data, using them directly in a search procedure is inefficient and inaccurate. Conversely, partial models focus on making high quality predictions for a subset of state and actions: those linked through affordances that achieve user intents~\citep{khetarpal2020can}. Can we posit large models as partial world models? We provide a formal answer to this question, proving that agents achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents necessarily possess predictive partial-world models informed by affordances. In the multi-task setting, we introduce distribution-robust affordances and show that partial models can be extracted to significantly improve search efficiency. Empirical evaluations in tabletop robotics tasks demonstrate that our affordance-aware partial models reduce the search branching factor and achieve higher rewards compared to full world models.

Motivation: 标准LLM评估仅测试设计能力，无法捕捉模型修订间行为变化或错误倾向等意外差异。模型对比技术可解决此问题，但缺乏系统比较与评估标准

Method: 提出针对泛化性、有趣度和抽象层级的评估指标，并用于系统比较LLM-based和SAE-based两种模型对比方法

Result: 改进的LLM基线方法性能与SAE方法相当，且通常能揭示更抽象的行为差异

Conclusion: LLM方法能有效识别模型间抽象行为差异，为模型对比提供了可行替代方案

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluations only test capabilities or dispositions that evaluators designed them for, missing unexpected differences such as behavioral shifts between model revisions or emergent misaligned tendencies. Model diffing addresses this limitation by automatically surfacing systematic behavioral differences. Recent approaches include LLM-based methods that generate natural language descriptions and sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based methods that identify interpretable features. However, no systematic comparison of these approaches exists nor are there established evaluation criteria. We address this gap by proposing evaluation metrics for key desiderata (generalization, interestingness, and abstraction level) and use these to compare existing methods. Our results show that an improved LLM-based baseline performs comparably to the SAE-based method while typically surfacing more abstract behavioral differences.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) trained on broad organic chemistry to smaller, domain-specific reaction datasets is a key challenge in chemical and pharmaceutical R&D. Effective specialisation requires learning new reaction knowledge while preserving general chemical understanding across related tasks. Here, we evaluate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for organic reaction prediction on limited, complex datasets. Using USPTO reaction classes and challenging C-H functionalisation reactions, we benchmark forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis and reagent prediction. LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full fine-tuning while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and better preserving multi-task performance. Both fine-tuning approaches generalise beyond training distributions, producing plausible alternative solvent predictions. Notably, C-H functionalisation fine-tuning reveals that LoRA and full fine-tuning encode subtly different reactivity patterns, suggesting more effective reaction-specific adaptation with LoRA. As LLMs continue to scale, our results highlight the practicality of modular, parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for their flexible deployment for chemistry applications.

TL;DR: Advanced AI models fail at basic integer addition due to tokenization-related misalignment and random carry errors, despite excelling at complex mathematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why state-of-the-art AI systems that handle advanced mathematics poorly perform basic arithmetic (e.g., multi-digit addition), revealing a fundamental capability gap.

Method: Systematic empirical testing of frontier models (Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) on integer addition tasks; analysis of error patterns (misalignment, carry failures) and their correlation with digit length and tokenization.

Result: Accuracy degrades significantly as digit count increases; 87.9% (Claude), 62.9% (GPT-5), and 92.4% (Gemini) of errors stem from operand misalignment (linked to tokenization) or incorrect carry operations.

Conclusion: AI arithmetic failures are interpretable and stem from architectural limitations (tokenization design and inconsistent carry handling), not just lack of training, indicating deep flaws in numerical processing.

Abstract: Modern AI systems have been successfully deployed to win medals at international math competitions, assist with research workflows, and prove novel technical lemmas. However, despite their progress at advanced levels of mathematics, they remain stubbornly bad at basic arithmetic, consistently failing on the simple task of adding two numbers. We present a systematic investigation of this phenomenon. We demonstrate empirically that all frontier models suffer significantly degraded accuracy for integer addition as the number of digits increases. Furthermore, we show that most errors made by these models are highly interpretable and can be attributed to either operand misalignment or a failure to correctly carry; these two error classes explain 87.9%, 62.9%, and 92.4% of Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro errors, respectively. Finally, we show that misalignment errors are frequently related to tokenization, and that carrying errors appear largely as independent random failures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning study using Nepal MICS 2019 data found TabNet best identified childhood malnutrition among 16 algorithms, with maternal education, wealth, and age as key predictors, offering a scalable screening tool for low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Childhood malnutrition is a major public health concern in Nepal and low-resource settings, but conventional case-finding methods are labor-intensive and unavailable in remote areas, creating need for automated screening solutions.

Method: Comprehensive assessment comparing 16 ML/DL algorithms using Nepal MICS 2019 data, constructing a composite malnutrition indicator from stunting/wasting/underweight, and evaluating performance with ten metrics emphasizing F1-score and recall due to class imbalance.

Result: TabNet demonstrated best performance due to its attention-based architecture, outperforming SVM and AdaBoost. Maternal education, household wealth index, and child age were primary predictors, followed by geography, vaccination status, and meal frequency.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a scalable, survey-based screening framework that can guide targeted nutritional interventions, support Nepal's SDG progress, and provide a transferable template for similar low-resource settings globally.

Abstract: Childhood malnutrition remains a major public health concern in Nepal and other low-resource settings, while conventional case-finding approaches are labor-intensive and frequently unavailable in remote areas. This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of machine learning and deep learning methodologies for identifying malnutrition among children under five years of age in Nepal. We systematically compared 16 algorithms spanning deep learning, gradient boosting, and traditional machine learning families, using data from the Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. A composite malnutrition indicator was constructed by integrating stunting, wasting, and underweight status, and model performance was evaluated using ten metrics, with emphasis on F1-score and recall to account for substantial class imbalance and the high cost of failing to detect malnourished children. Among all models, TabNet demonstrated the best performance, likely attributable to its attention-based architecture, and outperformed both support vector machine and AdaBoost classifiers. A consensus feature importance analysis identified maternal education, household wealth index, and child age as the primary predictors of malnutrition, followed by geographic characteristics, vaccination status, and meal frequency. Collectively, these results demonstrate a scalable, survey-based screening framework for identifying children at elevated risk of malnutrition and for guiding targeted nutritional interventions. The proposed approach supports Nepal's progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and offers a transferable methodological template for similar low-resource settings globally.

Conclusion: e²IP 框架为 MLIPs 提供了一种高效、可靠的不确定性量化方案，通过完全等变架构提高了数据效率，适用于主动学习等不确定性感知工作流程。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is critical for assessing the reliability of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, identifying extrapolation regimes and enabling uncertainty-aware workflows such as active learning for training dataset construction. Existing UQ approaches for MLIPs are often limited by high computational cost or suboptimal performance. Evidential deep learning (EDL) provides a theoretically grounded single-model alternative that determines both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass. However, extending evidential formulations from scalar targets to vector-valued quantities such as atomic forces introduces substantial challenges, particularly in maintaining statistical self-consistency under rotational transformations. To address this, we propose \textit{Equivariant Evidential Deep Learning for Interatomic Potentials} ($\text{e}^2$IP), a backbone-agnostic framework that models atomic forces and their uncertainty jointly by representing uncertainty as a full $3\times3$ symmetric positive definite covariance tensor that transforms equivariantly under rotations. Experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks show that $\text{e}^2$IP provides a stronger accuracy-efficiency-reliability balance than the non-equivariant evidential baseline and the widely used ensemble method. It also achieves better data efficiency through the fully equivariant architecture while retaining single-model inference efficiency.

Abstract: Policy-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) has established itself as the dominant paradigm in generative recommendation for optimizing sequential user interactions. However, when applied to offline historical logs, these methods suffer a critical failure: the dominance of low-quality data induces severe model collapse. We first establish the Divergence Theory of Repulsive Optimization, revealing that negative gradient updates inherently trigger exponential intensity explosion during off-policy training. This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem. Guided by this formulation, we propose Distributionally Robust Policy Optimization (DRPO). We prove that hard filtering is the exact solution to this DRO objective, enabling DRPO to optimally recover high-quality behaviors while strictly discarding divergence-inducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on mixed-quality recommendation benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph problems are fundamentally challenging for large language models (LLMs). While LLMs excel at processing unstructured text, graph tasks require reasoning over explicit structure, permutation invariance, and computationally complex relationships, creating a mismatch with the representations of text-based models. Our work investigates how LLMs can be effectively applied to graph problems despite these barriers. We introduce a human-interpretable structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation that injects graph structure directly into natural language prompts. Our method involves computing a variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) similarity classes and maps them to human-like color tokens rather than numeric labels. The key insight is that semantically meaningful and human-interpretable cues may be more effectively processed by LLMs than opaque symbolic encoding. Experimental results on multiple algorithmic and predictive graph tasks show the considerable improvements by our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. By capturing both local and global-range dependencies, our method enhances LLM performance especially on graph tasks that require reasoning over global graph structure.

TL;DR: Proposes tensor completion as an interpretable surrogate model for material design optimization, outperforming ML in non-uniform data scenarios while rediscovering physical phenomena via free tensor factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Material design parameter spaces grow exponentially, making exhaustive synthesis/computation (e.g., Finite Element Analysis) infeasible. Existing ML surrogates lack interpretability and underperform with non-uniformly sampled training data.

Method: Uses tensor completion methods (including specialized variants for non-uniform sampling) as an integrated solution for prediction and interpretability, leveraging inherent tensor factors to explain underlying physics.

Result: Tensor methods match ML prediction accuracy while providing interpretable factors that rediscover known physical phenomena. Specialized tensor models improve aggregate R² by 5% and halve errors in out-of-distribution regions compared to baseline ML.

Conclusion: Tensor completion offers superior interpretability and robustness for material design, with tensor factors serving as a tool to validate predictions against physics and potentially identify novel material patterns.

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to tailor the material design (with respect to its design parameters) to have some desired properties (e.g. Young's modulus). As the set of design parameters grow, the search space grows exponentially, making the actual synthesis and evaluation of all material combinations virtually impossible. Even using traditional computational methods such as Finite Element Analysis becomes too computationally heavy to search the design space. Recent methods use machine learning (ML) surrogate models to more efficiently determine optimal material designs; unfortunately, these methods often (i) are notoriously difficult to interpret and (ii) under perform when the training data comes from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We suggest the use of tensor completion methods as an all-in-one approach for interpretability and predictions. We observe classical tensor methods are able to compete with traditional ML in predictions, with the added benefit of their interpretable tensor factors (which are given completely for free, as a result of the prediction). In our experiments, we are able to rediscover physical phenomena via the tensor factors, indicating that our predictions are aligned with the true underlying physics of the problem. This also means these tensor factors could be used by experimentalists to identify potentially novel patterns, given we are able to rediscover existing ones. We also study the effects of both types of surrogate models when we encounter training data from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We observe more specialized tensor methods that can give better generalization in these non-uniforms sampling scenarios. We find the best generalization comes from a tensor model, which is able to improve upon the baseline ML methods by up to 5% on aggregate $R^2$, and halve the error in some out of distribution regions.

### [103] [A Unified Theory of Random Projection for Influence Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10449)
*Pingbang Hu,Yuzheng Hu,Jiaqi W. Ma,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a unified theory for when random projection (sketching) provably preserves influence functions $g^{\top}F^{-1}g^{\prime}$. It shows exact preservation requires sketch size $m \geq \text{rank}(F)$ for unregularized cases, but ridge regularization lowers requirements based on effective dimension. The theory also covers Kronecker-factored curvatures with decoupled sketches and quantifies a "leakage" term for general test points, providing practical guidance for sketch size selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Influence functions require inverting a large curvature matrix $F$, which is computationally prohibitive in modern overparameterized models. While random projection is used for scalability and justified by the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, this lemma doesn't address inversion or interactions with ridge regularization and structured curvature approximations, leaving a theoretical gap.

Method: The paper develops a unified theoretical framework analyzing when projection preserves influence functions. It examines: (1) range-restricted settings where gradients lie in $\text{range}(F)$, covering unregularized projection, regularized projection, and Kronecker-factored curvatures; and (2) out-of-range settings for general test points.

Result: (1) Unregularized: exact preservation iff sketch $P$ is injective on $\text{range}(F)$, requiring $m \geq \text{rank}(F)$. (2) Regularized: ridge regularization fundamentally alters sketching barriers, with guarantees governed by effective dimension of $F$ at the regularization scale. (3) Factorized: guarantees hold for decoupled sketches $P_A \otimes P_E$ on Kronecker-factored curvatures $F=A\otimes E$, despite non-i.i.d. row correlations. (4) Out-of-range: analysis quantifies a leakage term when test gradients have $\ker(F)$ components, extending guarantees to general test points.

Conclusion: This work provides the first unified theory characterizing provable preservation of influence functions under projection, offering principled guidance for selecting sketch sizes in practice that accounts for regularization and structured curvature approximations.

Abstract: Influence functions and related data attribution scores take the form of $g^{\top}F^{-1}g^{\prime}$, where $F\succeq 0$ is a curvature operator. In modern overparameterized models, forming or inverting $F\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ is prohibitive, motivating scalable influence computation via random projection with a sketch $P \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$. This practice is commonly justified via the Johnson--Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, which ensures approximate preservation of Euclidean geometry for a fixed dataset. However, JL does not address how sketching behaves under inversion. Furthermore, there is no existing theory that explains how sketching interacts with other widely-used techniques, such as ridge regularization and structured curvature approximations.
  We develop a unified theory characterizing when projection provably preserves influence functions. When $g,g^{\prime}\in\text{range}(F)$, we show that: 1) Unregularized projection: exact preservation holds iff $P$ is injective on $\text{range}(F)$, which necessitates $m\geq \text{rank}(F)$; 2) Regularized projection: ridge regularization fundamentally alters the sketching barrier, with approximation guarantees governed by the effective dimension of $F$ at the regularization scale; 3) Factorized influence: for Kronecker-factored curvatures $F=A\otimes E$, the guarantees continue to hold for decoupled sketches $P=P_A\otimes P_E$, even though such sketches exhibit row correlations that violate i.i.d. assumptions. Beyond this range-restricted setting, we analyze out-of-range test gradients and quantify a \emph{leakage} term that arises when test gradients have components in $\ker(F)$. This yields guarantees for influence queries on general test points.
  Overall, this work develops a novel theory that characterizes when projection provably preserves influence and provides principled guidance for choosing the sketch size in practice.

Abstract: Identifying where quantum models may offer practical benefits in near term quantum machine learning (QML) requires moving beyond isolated algorithmic proposals toward systematic and empirical exploration across models, datasets, and hardware constraints. We introduce MerLin, an open source framework designed as a discovery engine for photonic and hybrid quantum machine learning. MerLin integrates optimized strong simulation of linear optical circuits into standard PyTorch and scikit learn workflows, enabling end to end differentiable training of quantum layers. MerLin is designed around systematic benchmarking and reproducibility. As an initial contribution, we reproduce eighteen state of the art photonic and hybrid QML works spanning kernel methods, reservoir computing, convolutional and recurrent architectures, generative models, and modern training paradigms. These reproductions are released as reusable, modular experiments that can be directly extended and adapted, establishing a shared experimental baseline consistent with empirical benchmarking methodologies widely adopted in modern artificial intelligence. By embedding photonic quantum models within established machine learning ecosystems, MerLin allows practitioners to leverage existing tooling for ablation studies, cross modality comparisons, and hybrid classical quantum workflows. The framework already implements hardware aware features, allowing tests on available quantum hardware while enabling exploration beyond its current capabilities, positioning MerLin as a future proof co design tool linking algorithms, benchmarks, and hardware.

Abstract: Optimization modeling underpins decision-making in logistics, manufacturing, energy, and finance, yet translating natural-language requirements into correct optimization formulations and solver-executable code remains labor-intensive. Although large language models (LLMs) have been explored for this task, evaluation is still dominated by toy-sized or synthetic benchmarks, masking the difficulty of industrial problems with $10^{3}$--$10^{6}$ (or more) variables and constraints. A key bottleneck is the lack of benchmarks that align natural-language specifications with reference formulations/solver code grounded in real optimization models. To fill in this gap, we introduce MIPLIB-NL, built via a structure-aware reverse construction methodology from real mixed-integer linear programs in MIPLIB~2017. Our pipeline (i) recovers compact, reusable model structure from flat solver formulations, (ii) reverse-generates natural-language specifications explicitly tied to this recovered structure under a unified model--data separation format, and (iii) performs iterative semantic validation through expert review and human--LLM interaction with independent reconstruction checks. This yields 223 one-to-one reconstructions that preserve the mathematical content of the original instances while enabling realistic natural-language-to-optimization evaluation. Experiments show substantial performance degradation on MIPLIB-NL for systems that perform strongly on existing benchmarks, exposing failure modes invisible at toy scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出TaperNorm，通过门控机制实现从标准归一化到样本无关线性映射的平滑过渡，在保持性能的同时消除推理时的逐标记统计计算，实现最高1.22倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战预归一化Transformer中必须使用样本依赖归一化的假设，探究Transformer块内部是否需要这种归一化，以及输出归一化在训练稳定性中的真实作用。

Method: 设计TaperNorm作为RMSNorm/LayerNorm的替代方案，使用全局门控g（从1到0余弦衰减）控制过渡过程，通过指数移动平均校准缩放分支，最终在g=0时消除逐标记统计并使缩放参数可折叠到相邻线性层。

Result: 实验表明TaperNorm与标准归一化基线性能相当，但能消除推理时的逐标记统计计算，通过内部缩放折叠实现高达1.22倍吞吐提升；理论分析揭示输出归一化的尺度锚定作用是防止"logit追逐"的关键。

Conclusion: 该工作向无归一化Transformer迈进一步，明确输出归一化的核心功能是通过0-齐次映射提供尺度锚定，防止交叉熵导致的无界logit增长，为设计更高效架构提供新视角。

Abstract: Normalization is widely viewed as essential for stabilizing Transformer training. We revisit this assumption for pre-norm Transformers and ask to what extent sample-dependent normalization is needed inside Transformer blocks. We introduce TaperNorm, a drop-in replacement for RMSNorm/LayerNorm that behaves exactly like the standard normalizer early in training and then smoothly tapers to a learned sample-independent linear/affine map. A single global gate is held at $g{=}1$ during gate warmup, used to calibrate the scaling branch via EMAs, and then cosine-decayed to $g{=}0$, at which point per-token statistics vanish and the resulting fixed scalings can be folded into adjacent linear projections. Our theoretical and empirical results isolate scale anchoring as the key role played by output normalization: as a (near) $0$-homogeneous map it removes radial gradients at the output, whereas without such an anchor cross-entropy encourages unbounded logit growth (``logit chasing''). We further show that a simple fixed-target auxiliary loss on the pre-logit residual-stream scale provides an explicit alternative anchor and can aid removal of the final normalization layer. Empirically, TaperNorm matches normalized baselines under identical setups while eliminating per-token statistics and enabling these layers to be folded into adjacent linear projections at inference. On an efficiency microbenchmark, folding internal scalings yields up to $1.22\times$ higher throughput in last-token logits mode. These results take a step towards norm-free Transformers while identifying the special role output normalization plays.

*Yili Shen,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出LatentRxnFlow模型，基于条件流匹配将化学反应建模为连续潜空间轨迹，在保持SOTA预测精度的同时，提供反应机理洞察、不确定性量化和错误诊断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有反应预测模型在基准测试上准确率接近饱和，但大多为黑盒式一步映射，缺乏对反应过程的理解；而分步生成方法依赖机理标注、离散符号编辑且计算昂贵，亟需兼具高精度与高透明度的模型以支持高通量药物发现中的可信部署。

Method: 提出LatentRxnFlow新范式，基于条件流匹配直接从反应物-产物对中学习以热力学产物为锚点的时变潜空间动力学，无需机理标注或中间态标签，通过连续潜轨迹建模实现可解释的反应预测。

Result: 在USPTO基准测试上达到SOTA性能；暴露完整的生成轨迹以进行诊断；可定位并表征失败模式；通过门控推理减轻错误；学习到的轨迹几何特性提供内在认知不确定性信号，帮助优先选择可靠预测并标记模糊案例。

Conclusion: LatentRxnFlow将强预测精度与透明度、可诊断性和不确定性意识相结合，推动反应预测向高通量发现工作流中更可信的部署迈进。

Abstract: Recent advances in reaction prediction have achieved near-saturated accuracy on standard benchmarks (e.g., USPTO), yet most state-of-the-art models formulate the task as a one-shot mapping from reactants to products, offering limited insight into the underlying reaction process. Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows.

TL;DR: 提出LUCID Attention，通过预条件器解决softmax注意力在长序列中的概率扩散和梯度消失问题，在128K上下文长度下实现显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax注意力在长上下文场景中会将概率质量分散到无关token，降低性能；降低温度虽可增强聚焦但会导致梯度消失，损害模型学习能力。需要一种保持计算效率且可学习的替代方案。

Method: 设计基于指数化key-key相似度的预条件器，应用于注意力概率，在再生核希尔伯特空间中减少key之间的重叠，使query能准确聚焦重要key，同时保持与标准注意力相同的计算复杂度。

Result: 在10亿参数模型上验证，128K tokens上下文长度下，长上下文检索任务表现显著提升：BABILong提升达18%，RULER多针检索提升达14%，优于标准注意力。

Conclusion: LUCID Attention通过预条件化方法有效解决了长序列注意力分散和可学习性问题，为Transformer架构提供了可扩展的长上下文建模能力。

Abstract: Softmax-based dot-product attention is a cornerstone of Transformer architectures, enabling remarkable capabilities such as in-context learning. However, as context lengths increase, a fundamental limitation of the softmax function emerges: it tends to diffuse probability mass to irrelevant tokens degrading performance in long-sequence scenarios. Furthermore, attempts to sharpen focus by lowering softmax temperature hinder learnability due to vanishing gradients. We introduce LUCID Attention, an architectural modification that applies a preconditioner to the attention probabilities. This preconditioner, derived from exponentiated key-key similarities, minimizes overlap between the keys in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, thus allowing the query to focus on important keys among large number of keys accurately with same computational complexity as standard attention. Additionally, LUCID's preconditioning-based approach to retrieval bypasses the need for low temperature and the learnability problems associated with it. We validate our approach by training ~1 billion parameter language models evaluated on up to 128K tokens. Our results demonstrate significant gains on long-context retrieval tasks, specifically retrieval tasks from BABILong, RULER, SCROLLS and LongBench. For instance, LUCID achieves up to 18% improvement in BABILong and 14% improvement in RULER multi-needle performance compared to standard attention.

TL;DR: 本文提出ADAlign，一种用于图域适应的自适应分布对齐框架，通过神经谱差异自动识别并对齐图间的分布偏移，无需手动特征选择，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图域适应方法依赖人工选择的图元素和场景特定启发式规则来对齐分布，导致灵活性不足，在分布偏移多样化的迁移场景中效果不佳。

Method: 提出ADAlign框架，引入神经谱差异(NSD)，利用神经特征函数在谱域编码特征-结构依赖关系，并通过可学习的频率采样器以极小极大范式自适应地强调每个任务中最具信息量的谱成分。

Result: 在10个数据集和16个迁移任务上的广泛实验表明，ADAlign不仅超越了先进基线方法，还在内存使用和训练速度方面实现了效率提升。

Conclusion: ADAlign为图域适应提供了一种灵活、场景感知的解决方案，能够自动识别相关差异并鲁棒地处理多样化的分布偏移，无需手动指定对齐标准。

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs but is challenged by complex, multi-faceted distributional shifts. Existing methods attempt to reduce distributional shifts by aligning manually selected graph elements (e.g., node attributes or structural statistics), which typically require manually designed graph filters to extract relevant features before alignment. However, such approaches are inflexible: they rely on scenario-specific heuristics, and struggle when dominant discrepancies vary across transfer scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets and 16 transfer tasks show that ADAlign not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also achieves efficiency gains with lower memory usage and faster training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型对外生协变量处理不足（忽略或简单拼接），限制了其在电力价格预测等协变量丰富场景的效果。

Method: 在LightGTS（约100万参数）基础上增加仅0.1M参数的MLP插件，通过残差细化解码输出，同时整合历史及未来已知协变量。

Conclusion: 该方法在光伏功率预测和电力价格预测等真实工业场景中验证了有效性与部署稳定性，具备实用价值。

Abstract: Time series foundation models are typically pre-trained on large, multi-source datasets; however, they often ignore exogenous covariates or incorporate them via simple concatenation with the target series, which limits their effectiveness in covariate-rich applications such as electricity price forecasting and renewable energy forecasting. We introduce LightGTS-Cov, a covariate-enhanced extension of LightGTS that preserves its lightweight, period-aware backbone while explicitly incorporating both past and future-known covariates. Built on a $\sim$1M-parameter LightGTS backbone, LightGTS-Cov adds only a $\sim$0.1M-parameter MLP plug-in that integrates time-aligned covariates into the target forecasts by residually refining the outputs of the decoding process. Across covariate-aware benchmarks on electricity price and energy generation datasets, LightGTS-Cov consistently outperforms LightGTS and achieves superior performance over other covariate-aware baselines under both settings, regardless of whether future-known covariates are provided. We further demonstrate its practical value in two real-world energy case applications: long-term photovoltaic power forecasting with future weather forecasts and day-ahead electricity price forecasting with weather and dispatch-plan covariates. Across both applications, LightGTS-Cov achieves strong forecasting accuracy and stable operational performance after deployment, validating its effectiveness in real-world industrial settings.

### [111] [Low-Dimensional Execution Manifolds in Transformer Learning Dynamics: Evidence from Modular Arithmetic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10496)
*Yongzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers with 128-dimensional parameter spaces actually operate in just 3-4 dimensions during training, collapsing onto low-dimensional "execution manifolds" where core computation happens while most parameters absorb optimization noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the geometric structure of learning dynamics in overparameterized transformers and why they work so well despite massive parameter counts.

Method: Using carefully controlled modular arithmetic tasks to analyze training trajectories and discover low-dimensional geometric structures in high-dimensional parameter spaces.

Result: Training trajectories rapidly collapse onto 3-4 dimensional execution manifolds; attention concentration emerges from routing coordinate saturation; SGD shows integrable dynamics on this subspace; sparse autoencoders fail to isolate execution itself.

Conclusion: Overparameterization serves a geometric purpose: most parameters absorb optimization interference while core computation occurs in a dramatically reduced subspace, offering a unifying framework for interpretability and training design.

Abstract: We investigate the geometric structure of learning dynamics in overparameterized transformer models through carefully controlled modular arithmetic tasks. Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold. Our results suggest a unifying geometric framework for understanding transformer learning, where the vast majority of parameters serve to absorb optimization interference while core computation occurs in a dramatically reduced subspace. These findings have implications for interpretability, training curriculum design, and understanding the role of overparameterization in neural network learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECoG在帕金森病早期预测中具有优势，但受限于伦理约束和缺乏开放基准数据集，且面临高被试间变异性和高维小样本问题。

Method: 提出Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF)，包含鲁棒预处理、跨被试平衡通道交换(ISBCS)和域对抗训练，通过随机交换通道减少变异性，学习共享特征。

Result: 在跨被试、跨会话和跨数据集实验中均优于基线，在高度可变环境中改善显著，在EEG数据集上也表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升帕金森病预测的鲁棒性和泛化能力，适用于ECoG和EEG数据，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (ECoG) offers a promising alternative to conventional electrocorticography (EEG) for the early prediction of Parkinson's disease (PD), providing higher spatial resolution and a broader frequency range. However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data. The new dataset and source code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Conclusion: 信号空间对齐是二元/离散域鲁棒扩散学习的关键原则，为流匹配提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, with recent empirical successes highlighting the effectiveness of signal-space prediction ($x$-prediction). In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning.

TL;DR: QTALE框架实现了token-adaptive层执行与量化的无缝集成，通过探索多样化的训练路径和灵活调整推理执行比例来保持模型精度，在CommonsenseQA基准上将精度差距控制在0.5%以内，为高效部署大语言模型提供了有效解决方案。


<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型需要大量计算和内存资源，token-adaptive层执行和量化是两种互补的优化方法，但简单集成会导致精度下降，因为token-adaptive模型减少了冗余。

Method: 提出QTALE框架，包含：1）训练策略确保在微调期间主动探索多样化的执行路径；2）后训练机制允许在推理时灵活调整执行比例以重新引入冗余。

Result: 实验表明QTALE实现了token-adaptive执行与量化的无缝集成，精度差异不明显，在CommonsenseQA基准上与仅量化模型的差距保持在0.5%以内。

Conclusion: QTALE通过结合token-adaptive执行（降低FLOPs）和量化（节省内存），为高效部署大语言模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory resources, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment.

Conclusion: PiT-PO通过自适应LLM微调实现了高性能科学发现的民主化，让小型模型也能达到顶尖性能。

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to distill mathematical equations from observational data. Recent approaches have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate equation hypotheses, capitalizing on their vast pre-trained scientific priors. However, existing frameworks predominantly treat the LLM as a static generator, relying on prompt-level guidance to steer exploration. This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions. In this work, we propose PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization), a unified framework that evolves the LLM into an adaptive generator via reinforcement learning. Central to PiT-PO is a dual-constraint mechanism that rigorously enforces hierarchical physical validity while simultaneously applying fine-grained, token-level penalties to suppress redundant structures. Consequently, PiT-PO aligns LLM to produce equations that are both scientifically consistent and structurally parsimonious. Empirically, PiT-PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and successfully discovers novel turbulence models for challenging fluid dynamics problems. We also demonstrate that PiT-PO empowers small-scale models to outperform closed-source giants, democratizing access to high-performance scientific discovery.

Motivation: 层次凝聚聚类(HAC)缺乏明确的全局目标函数，聚类质量主要依赖经验评估。经典连接函数(如单连接、平均连接和Ward法)在不同真实数据集上表现差异大，无法持续产生高质量聚类结果。

Method: 提出Chamfer-linkage，使用Chamfer距离(机器学习与计算机视觉中流行的点云距离度量)来衡量簇间距离，并论证其满足其他方法难以满足的理想概念表示性质。

Result: 理论证明Chamfer-linkage HAC可在O(n²)时间内实现，效率与经典连接函数相当；实验表明其在多样化数据集上持续产生比平均连接和Ward法更高质量的聚类结果。

Conclusion: Chamfer-linkage可作为经典连接函数的实际替代品，为层次聚类的理论和实践提供了更丰富的工具选择。

Abstract: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is a widely-used clustering method based on repeatedly merging the closest pair of clusters, where inter-cluster distances are determined by a linkage function. Unlike many clustering methods, HAC does not optimize a single explicit global objective; clustering quality is therefore primarily evaluated empirically, and the choice of linkage function plays a crucial role in practice. However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.
  In this paper, we propose \emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets. Our results establish Chamfer-linkage as a practical drop-in replacement for classical linkage functions, broadening the toolkit for hierarchical clustering in both theory and practice.

Conclusion: VESPO为LLM强化学习训练提供了理论统一的稳定性解决方案，有效应对策略陈旧问题。

Abstract: Training stability remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs). Policy staleness, asynchronous training, and mismatches between training and inference engines all cause the behavior policy to diverge from the current policy, risking training collapse. Importance sampling provides a principled correction for this distribution shift but suffers from high variance; existing remedies such as token-level clipping and sequence-level normalization lack a unified theoretical foundation. We propose Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization (VESPO). By incorporating variance reduction into a variational formulation over proposal distributions, VESPO derives a closed-form reshaping kernel that operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without length normalization. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that VESPO maintains stable training under staleness ratios up to 64x and fully asynchronous execution, and delivers consistent gains across both dense and Mixture-of-Experts models.

Conclusion: 成功平衡异常检测精度与可解释性，提升GLAD系统在现实应用中的可靠性

Abstract: The task of graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) is to identify anomalous graphs that deviate significantly from the majority of graphs in a dataset. While deep GLAD methods have shown promising performance, their black-box nature limits their reliability and deployment in real-world applications. Although some recent methods have made attempts to provide explanations for anomaly detection results, they either provide explanations without referencing normal graphs, or rely on abstract latent vectors as prototypes rather than concrete graphs from the dataset. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies.

Abstract: Interpreting the inference-time behavior of deep neural networks remains a challenging problem. Existing approaches to counterfactual explanation typically ask: What is the closest alternative input that would alter the model's prediction in a desired way? In contrast, we explore counterfactual datasets. Rather than perturbing the input, our method efficiently finds the closest alternative training dataset, one that differs from the original dataset by changing a few labels. Training a new model on this altered dataset can then lead to a different prediction of a given test instance. This perspective provides a new way to assess fairness by directly analyzing the influence of label bias on training and inference. Our approach can be characterized as probing whether a given prediction depends on biased labels. Since exhaustively enumerating all possible alternate datasets is infeasible, we develop analysis techniques that trace how bias in the training data may propagate through the learning algorithm to the trained network. Our method heuristically ranks and modifies the labels of a bounded number of training examples to construct a counterfactual dataset, retrains the model, and checks whether its prediction on a chosen test case changes. We evaluate our approach on feedforward neural networks across over 1100 test cases from 7 widely-used fairness datasets. Results show that it modifies only a small subset of training labels, highlighting its ability to pinpoint the critical training examples that drive prediction changes. Finally, we demonstrate how our counterfactual datasets reveal connections between training examples and test cases, offering an interpretable way to probe dataset bias.

### [120] [Kill it with FIRE: On Leveraging Latent Space Directions for Runtime Backdoor Mitigation in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10780)
*Enrico Ahlers,Daniel Passon,Yannic Noller,Lars Grunske*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes FIRE, a novel inference-time approach to neutralize backdoor attacks on neural networks by reverse-applying the backdoor's latent space directions to repair poisoned inputs during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoored neural networks pose a serious security threat as they can be manipulated through triggers, but existing defenses are ineffective for already deployed models because they require retraining, data filtering, or expensive input modifications.

Method: The authors hypothesize that triggers create structured, repeatable changes in internal representations, which manifest as specific directions in latent spaces between layers. They propose FIRE, which manipulates these latent representations during inference by moving poisoned samples' features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger, effectively using the backdoored model against itself.

Result: FIRE demonstrates low computational overhead and outperforms existing runtime mitigations across various backdoor attacks, image datasets, and network architectures.

Conclusion: Inference-time feature-space manipulation offers an effective and efficient solution for defending against backdoor attacks in deployed models, eliminating the need for retraining or extensive input preprocessing.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly present in our everyday lives; as a result, they become targets of adversarial attackers seeking to manipulate the systems we interact with. A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures.

TL;DR: 该论文提出CycFlow，一种通过确定性点传输替代迭代边缘去噪的神经组合优化新框架，用于解决欧几里得旅行商问题，实现比扩散模型快三个数量级的求解速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经组合优化方法主要依赖扩散模型处理TSP问题，但存在计算效率低下的二次复杂度瓶颈，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出CycFlow框架，学习实例条件向量场，将输入的2D坐标连续传输到标准圆形排列，并通过角度排序从2N维表示中恢复最优路径。

Result: 相比最新扩散基线，求解速度提升高达三个数量级，同时保持具有竞争力的最优性差距。

Conclusion: 通过用线性坐标动力学替代二次边缘评分，CycFlow实现了神经组合优化范式的转变，在保持解质量的同时极大提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) have been dominated by diffusion models that treat the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a stochastic $N \times N$ heatmap generation task. In this paper, we propose CycFlow, a framework that replaces iterative edge denoising with deterministic point transport. CycFlow learns an instance-conditioned vector field that continuously transports input 2D coordinates to a canonical circular arrangement, where the optimal tour is recovered from this $2N$ dimensional representation via angular sorting. By leveraging data-dependent flow matching, we bypass the quadratic bottleneck of edge scoring in favor of linear coordinate dynamics. This paradigm shift accelerates solving speed by up to three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines, while maintaining competitive optimality gaps.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 针对多元时间序列预测中现有模型无法有效捕捉长周期全局模式的问题，本文提出了一种轻量级即插即用的全局时间检索器(GTR)。该方法通过维护自适应全局时间嵌入并动态检索对齐相关片段，结合2D卷积和残差融合，在不改变原模型架构的前提下显著提升长短周期预测性能，且计算开销极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多元时间序列预测模型受限于历史上下文窗口长度，无法捕捉超出输入视界的长周期全局模式，而这些模式蕴含强预测信号。简单扩展历史窗口会导致过拟合、计算成本过高和信息冗余等问题。

Method: 提出Global Temporal Retriever (GTR)，一个轻量级即插即用模块。GTR维护整个周期的自适应全局时间嵌入，动态检索并将相关全局片段与输入序列对齐。通过2D卷积和残差融合联合建模局部和全局依赖关系，无需修改宿主模型架构。

Result: 在六个真实数据集上的大量实验表明，GTR在长短周期预测场景下均持续达到SOTA性能，且参数量和计算开销极低。

Conclusion: GTR为增强多元时间序列预测中的全局周期性建模提供了一种高效通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in numerous real-world applications, yet existing models remain constrained by their reliance on a limited historical context. This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/macovaseas/GTR.

*Luigi Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Benchmarking study of four Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for electricity demand forecasting shows zero-shot models outperform traditional methods, especially with limited historical data, but exhibit varying calibration quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether Time Series Foundation Models' zero-shot prediction capabilities translate to mission-critical electricity demand forecasting where accuracy, calibration, and robustness directly impact grid operations.

Method: Multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, TinyTimeMixer against Prophet baseline and statistical references (SARIMA, Seasonal Naive) using ERCOT hourly load data (2020-2024). Tests context length sensitivity (24-2048 hours), probabilistic calibration, robustness to distribution shifts (COVID-19, Winter Storm Uri), and prescriptive analytics on consumer-grade hardware.

Result: TSFMs achieve MASE ~0.31 at long context (2048h), 47% better than Seasonal Naive. Unlike Prophet (MASE >74 at 24h context), TSFMs maintain stable accuracy with minimal data. Calibration varies: Chronos-2 is well-calibrated (95% coverage at 90% nominal), while Moirai-2 and Prophet are overconfident (~70% coverage).

Conclusion: TSFMs demonstrate strong potential for zero-shot electricity demand forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, but model selection is critical due to calibration differences. Authors provide practical guidelines and release benchmark framework for reproducibility.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have introduced zero-shot prediction capabilities that bypass the need for task-specific training. Whether these capabilities translate to mission-critical applications such as electricity demand forecasting--where accuracy, calibration, and robustness directly affect grid operations--remains an open question. We present a multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating four TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, and TinyTimeMixer) alongside Prophet as an industry-standard baseline and two statistical references (SARIMA and Seasonal Naive), using ERCOT hourly load data from 2020 to 2024. All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage). We provide practical model selection guidelines and release the complete benchmark framework for reproducibility.

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing services has fundamentally transformed urban mobility patterns, making accurate ride-hailing forecasting crucial for optimizing passenger experience and urban transportation efficiency. However, ride-hailing forecasting faces significant challenges due to geospatial heterogeneity and high susceptibility to external events. This paper proposes MVGR-Net(Multi-View Geospatial Representation Learning), a novel framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage approach. In the pretraining stage, we learn comprehensive geospatial representations by integrating Points-of-Interest and temporal mobility patterns to capture regional characteristics from both semantic attribute and temporal mobility pattern views. The forecasting stage leverages these representations through a prompt-empowered framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models while incorporating external events. Extensive experiments on DiDi's real-world datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中数据预处理（缺失值、格式不一致、特征尺度异质）对模型性能至关重要但研究不足，隐私约束禁止集中原始数据，通信效率带来额外挑战。

Method: 基于聚合统计提出FedPS框架，利用数据素描技术高效总结本地数据集，设计联邦特征缩放、编码、离散化、缺失值填补算法，并将k-Means、k-NN、贝叶斯线性回归等模型扩展到横向和纵向联邦学习。

Result: 提供了灵活、通信高效且一致的联邦数据预处理流水线，支持多种预处理任务和不同联邦学习场景。

Conclusion: FedPS为实际联邦学习部署提供了有效的预处理解决方案，解决了隐私和通信约束下的数据预处理难题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data. However, before training, data must be preprocessed to address missing values, inconsistent formats, and heterogeneous feature scales. This preprocessing stage is critical for model performance but is largely overlooked in FL research. In practical FL systems, privacy constraints prohibit centralizing raw data, while communication efficiency introduces further challenges for distributed preprocessing. We introduce FedPS, a unified framework for federated data preprocessing based on aggregated statistics. FedPS leverages data-sketching techniques to efficiently summarize local datasets while preserving essential statistical information. Building on these summaries, we design federated algorithms for feature scaling, encoding, discretization, and missing-value imputation, and extend preprocessing-related models such as k-Means, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Bayesian Linear Regression to both horizontal and vertical FL settings. FedPS provides flexible, communication-efficient, and consistent preprocessing pipelines for practical FL deployments.

Abstract: Board games have long served as complex decision-making benchmarks in artificial intelligence. In this field, search-based reinforcement learning methods such as AlphaZero have achieved remarkable success. However, their significant computational demands have been pointed out as barriers to their reproducibility. In this study, we propose a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm designed for board games to achieve more efficient learning. To validate the efficiency of the proposed method, we conducted comprehensive experiments on five board games: Animal Shogi, Gardner Chess, Go, Hex, and Othello. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more efficient learning than existing methods across these environments. In addition, our extensive ablation study shows the importance of core techniques used in the proposed method. We believe that our efficient algorithm shows the potential of model-free reinforcement learning in domains traditionally dominated by search-based methods.

### [127] [Prioritize the Process, Not Just the Outcome: Rewarding Latent Thought Trajectories Improves Reasoning in Looped Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10520)
*Williams Jonathan,Tureci Esin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLTT is a novel reinforcement learning framework for Looped Language Models that distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory instead of only the final state, achieving substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (+14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, +10.0% on BeyondAIME) and demonstrating effective transfer to non-mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL methods like GRPO only assign credit to the final latent state in LoopLMs, creating a mismatch with the model's multi-step internal computation and failing to improve reasoning performance.

Method: RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories) provides dense, trajectory-level credit assignment by distributing reward across the entire latent reasoning trajectory, replacing GRPO with negligible overhead and without requiring external verifiers.

Result: On Ouro-2.6B-Thinking under identical conditions, RLTT outperforms GRPO by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME, while also transferring effectively to non-mathematical reasoning benchmarks despite math-only training.

Conclusion: Trajectory-level credit assignment is highly effective for reinforcement learning in LoopLMs, resolving the credit assignment problem and enabling significant reasoning improvements.

Abstract: Looped Language Models (LoopLMs) perform multi-step latent reasoning prior to token generation and outperform conventional LLMs on reasoning benchmarks at smaller parameter budgets. However, attempts to further improve LoopLM reasoning with reinforcement learning have failed - standard objectives such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) only assign credit to the final latent state, creating a fundamental mismatch with the model's internal computation. To resolve this, we introduce RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories), a reinforcement learning framework which distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory. RLTT provides dense, trajectory-level credit assignment without relying on external verifiers and can directly replace GRPO with negligible overhead. Across extensive experiments with Ouro-2.6B-Thinking under identical training and inference conditions, RLTT yields substantial improvements over GRPO on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME. Despite being trained exclusively on mathematics, RLTT also transfers effectively to non-mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of trajectory-level credit assignment for reinforcement learning in LoopLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文通过信号处理理论重新解释旋转位置编码(RoPE)，推导出其基础参数的下界（混叠界限和稳定性界限）和上界（精度限制），定义了长上下文Transformer的"适居带"，并用主流模型验证了理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转位置编码(RoPE)在大语言模型中广泛应用，但其长上下文行为缺乏系统分析，亟需理论框架来解释和预测其性能边界。

Method: 将RoPE重新解释为复振荡器的相位调制，运用经典信号处理理论推导基础参数的下界（混叠界限、低频相位漂移约束），并扩展到深层Transformer分析层间累积效应，同时考虑浮点精度带来的上界限制。

Result: 提出了精度和深度依赖的"适居带"理论框架，通过LLaMA、Mistral、DeepSeek等模型的案例分析验证，发现违反稳定性界限会导致注意力崩溃，且超过百万token的扩展存在无法逾越的精度墙。

Conclusion: 该理论框架成功解释了RoPE在长上下文下的行为，为模型设计和扩展提供了理论指导，揭示了架构无关的fundamental限制。

Abstract: Rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) are widely used in large language models to encode token positions through multiplicative rotations, yet their behavior at long context lengths remains poorly characterized. In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory.
  Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.
  Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.
  We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds. Notably, models that violate the stability bound exhibit attention collapse and long-range degradation, while attempts to scale beyond one million tokens encounter a hard precision wall independent of architecture or training.

Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous, and learning on graphs has become a cornerstone in artificial intelligence and data mining communities. Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ROCKET是一种无训练的模型压缩方法，通过多选择背包问题优化层间压缩分配，结合单步稀疏矩阵分解，在20-50%压缩率下实现SOTA性能，30%压缩时无需微调即可保留90%以上原始性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型部署需要高效压缩，但现有因子分解、结构化剪枝和动态压缩方法存在计算开销大、需要训练或微调等问题。

Method: 1) 将层间压缩分配建模为多选择背包问题，在目标模型大小约束下选择每层最优压缩级别以最小化重建误差；2) 单步稀疏矩阵分解：使用小校准集，基于激活-权重敏感度稀疏化权重系数，并通过最小二乘法闭式更新字典，完全绕过迭代优化、稀疏编码或反向传播。

Result: 在20-50%压缩率下持续优于现有方法；30%压缩时无需微调即可保留90%以上原始模型性能；轻量微调（3000万token）可将Qwen3-14B压缩至8B参数规模，性能接近原始Qwen3-8B。

Conclusion: ROCKET通过两个关键创新实现了高效无训练压缩，在保持模型性能的同时显著减小模型尺寸，为大规模模型部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present ROCKET, a training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\% of the original model's performance at 30\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B. The code for ROCKET is at github.com/mts-ai/ROCKET/tree/main.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种混合架构，将EEG测量提取与文本生成分离，以克服大型语言模型在自动癫痫发作检测中的局限性。通过压缩前信号处理计算精确临床值，实现了假警报减少60%、检测速度提升50%以及亚临床测量精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大型语言模型的EEG监护系统存在两大关键限制：一是长记录需要极高压缩比（400:1+）而破坏时间精度（0.5 Hz误差可导致癫痫类型误判），二是LLM缺乏固有时间序列理解能力，导致临床测量值幻觉。

Method: 该方法采用混合架构：(1)分离测量提取与文本生成；(2)压缩前通过信号处理计算精确临床值；(3)使用跨模态桥接进行EEG到语言翻译；(4)采用参数高效微调与冻结槽约束解码；(5)多速率采样以保持长程上下文和事件级精度。

Result: 在TUH和CHB-MIT数据集上评估显示：假警报减少60%，检测速度提升50%，并实现了亚临床测量精度（确保临床测量准确性）。

Conclusion: 该论文得出结论：这是首个能保证自动EEG报告中临床测量准确性的系统，通过结合精确信号处理和语言生成，克服了医疗时间序列分析中LLM的根本限制。

Abstract: Automated EEG monitoring requires clinician-level precision for seizure detection and reporting. Clinical EEG recordings exceed LLM context windows, requiring extreme compression (400:1+ ratios) that destroys fine-grained temporal precision. A 0.5 Hz error distinguishes absence epilepsy from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. LLMs lack inherent time-series comprehension and rely on statistical associations from compressed representations. This dual limitation causes systems to hallucinate clinically incorrect measurement values.
  We separate measurement extraction from text generation. Our hybrid architecture computes exact clinical values via signal processing before compression, employs a cross-modal bridge for EEG-to-language translation, and uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning with constrained decoding around frozen slots. Multirate sampling maintains long-range context while preserving event-level precision. Evaluation on TUH and CHB-MIT datasets achieves 60% fewer false alarms, 50% faster detection, and sub-clinical measurement precision. This is the first system guaranteeing clinical measurement accuracy in automated EEG reports.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of offline safe imitation learning (IL), where the goal is to learn safe and reward-maximizing policies from demonstrations that do not have per-timestep safety cost or reward information. In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.

*Frank Xiao,Santiago Aranguri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出"基于激活的数据归因"方法，通过计算激活差异向量并排序余弦相似度，定位导致语言模型特定行为的训练数据点。在OLMo 2的DPO训练中发现"干扰项触发合规"问题（添加良性格式指令后模型即服从危险请求），过滤或翻转相关数据可减少63-78%该行为，性能优于梯度归因和LLM-judge基线且成本低10倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（梯度归因、LLM评判）成本高且效果有限，需开发更便宜高效的技术来追溯有害行为到训练数据，尤其是由数据污染而非故意注入导致的自然涌现行为，为模型安全提供现实基准。

Method: 激活差异归因：为测试提示和偏好对计算激活差异向量，按余弦相似度对训练数据排序，识别关键数据点。通过修改数据重训练验证因果性，并利用聚类实现无监督行为发现。

Result: 在OLMo 2中发现"干扰项触发合规"；过滤前5%数据减少63%有害行为，翻转标签减少78%；性能优于梯度方法和LLM基线；成本仅为两者1/10。

Conclusion: 激活归因方法高效精准，成功揭示自然涌现的有害行为模式，为安全对齐技术提供了真实世界的评估基准，证明数据污染可导致意外风险。

Abstract: We propose activation-based data attribution, a method that traces behavioral changes in post-trained language models to responsible training datapoints. By computing activation-difference vectors for both test prompts and preference pairs and ranking by cosine similarity, we identify datapoints that cause specific behaviors and validate these attributions causally by retraining with modified data. Clustering behavior-datapoint similarity matrices also enables unsupervised discovery of emergent behaviors. Applying this to OLMo 2's production DPO training, we surfaced distractor-triggered compliance: a harmful behavior where the model complies with dangerous requests when benign formatting instructions are appended. Filtering top-ranked datapoints reduces this behavior by 63% while switching their labels achieves 78%. Our method outperforms gradient-based attribution and LLM-judge baselines while being over 10 times cheaper than both. This in-the-wild model organism - emerging from contaminated preference data rather than deliberate injection - provides a realistic benchmark for safety techniques.

TL;DR: 提出GRASP框架，结合SHAP和组L21正则化进行医疗预测的特征选择，相比LASSO等方法获得更稳定、可解释性更强的特征子集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗预测中特征选择面临挑战，现有方法如LASSO缺乏鲁棒性和可解释性

Method: 提出GRASP框架：1)通过SHAP从预训练树模型提取组级别重要性分数；2)使用组L21正则化逻辑回归强制结构化稀疏性

Result: 与LASSO、SHAP和深度学习方法对比显示，GRASP在保持或提升预测准确率的同时，能识别更少、冗余度更低、更稳定的特征

Conclusion: GRASP为医疗预测提供了高效、可解释的特征选择方案

Abstract: Feature selection remains a major challenge in medical prediction, where existing approaches such as LASSO often lack robustness and interpretability. We introduce GRASP, a novel framework that couples Shapley value driven attribution with group $L_{21}$ regularization to extract compact and non-redundant feature sets. GRASP first distills group level importance scores from a pretrained tree model via SHAP, then enforces structured sparsity through group $L_{21}$ regularized logistic regression, yielding stable and interpretable selections. Extensive comparisons with LASSO, SHAP, and deep learning based methods show that GRASP consistently delivers comparable or superior predictive accuracy, while identifying fewer, less redundant, and more stable features.

### [135] [Online Min-Max Optimization: From Individual Regrets to Cumulative Saddle Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10565)
*Abhijeet Vyas,Brian Bullins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies online min-max optimization beyond convex-concave settings, finding that static Nash equilibrium is incompatible with individual regrets. It proposes two new performance measures: static duality gap (SDual-Gap_T) and dynamic saddle point regret (DSP-Reg_T), achieving bounds via reduction to OCO problems under strong convexity-concavity, min-max exponential concavity, and PL conditions, with application to portfolio selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional online min-max optimization relies on static Nash equilibrium, but this measure fails to align with individual regrets even for strongly convex-strongly concave functions. The paper aims to develop alternative performance measures that better capture online min-max optimization performance, particularly extending beyond the restrictive convex-concave setting.

Method: The authors propose two novel performance measures: SDual-Gap_T inspired by online convex optimization, and DSP-Reg_T as a min-max version of dynamic regret. They use a reduction technique to transform online min-max problems into classic online convex optimization problems, leveraging established OCO algorithms and analysis to derive theoretical bounds.

Result: 1. Identified incompatibility between static Nash equilibrium and individual regrets; 2. Developed algorithms achieving bounds for SDual-Gap_T and DSP-Reg_T; 3. Established bounds under strong convexity-strong concavity and a new min-max exponential concavity (min-max EC) condition; 4. Showed two-player portfolio selection satisfies min-max EC; 5. Derived bounds under two-sided PL condition for dynamic regret compatible with individual regrets.

Conclusion: The paper successfully introduces and validates new performance measures (SDual-Gap_T and DSP-Reg_T) for online min-max optimization that address fundamental limitations of traditional static Nash equilibrium, providing strong theoretical guarantees across multiple function classes and demonstrating practical relevance to financial problems like portfolio selection.

Abstract: We propose and study an online version of min-max optimization based on cumulative saddle points under a variety of performance measures beyond convex-concave settings. After first observing the incompatibility of (static) Nash equilibrium (SNE-Reg$_T$) with individual regrets even for strongly convex-strongly concave functions, we propose an alternate \emph{static} duality gap (SDual-Gap$_T$) inspired by the online convex optimization (OCO) framework. We provide algorithms that, using a reduction to classic OCO problems, achieve bounds for SDual-Gap$_T$~and a novel \emph{dynamic} saddle point regret (DSP-Reg$_T$), which we suggest naturally represents a min-max version of the dynamic regret in OCO. We derive our bounds for SDual-Gap$_T$~and DSP-Reg$_T$~under strong convexity-strong concavity and a min-max notion of exponential concavity (min-max EC), and in addition we establish a class of functions satisfying min-max EC~that captures a two-player variant of the classic portfolio selection problem. Finally, for a dynamic notion of regret compatible with individual regrets, we derive bounds under a two-sided Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际离线数据集常存在探索不足和策略多样性问题，导致传统离线RL算法在Q/V值估计和策略约束间难以平衡

Method: 通过线性规划形式建立f-散度与贝尔曼残差约束的联系，设计自适应调整学习目标的灵活f-散度公式

Result: 在MuJoCo、Fetch和AdroitHand环境上验证了LP形式的正确性，以及灵活f-散度在挑战性数据集上的性能提升潜力

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据驱动的自适应约束，有效平衡了RL目标与行为策略约束，为处理复杂离线数据集提供了新思路

Abstract: Offline RL algorithms aim to improve upon the behavior policy that produces the collected data while constraining the learned policy to be within the support of the dataset. However, practical offline datasets often contain examples with little diversity or limited exploration of the environment, and from multiple behavior policies with diverse expertise levels. Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \textit{Q} or \textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset. Results from experiments on the MuJoCo, Fetch, and AdroitHand environments show the correctness of the proposed LP form and the potential of the flexible $f$-divergence in improving performance for learning from a challenging dataset when applied to a compatible constrained optimization algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出K-FADE方法，通过K-FAC近似Hessian矩阵，在遗忘集上计算少量高斯-牛顿步实现LLM高效遗忘，在保留集上性能损失最小且遗忘效果可持续


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LLM训练会产生部署时不可接受的输出，现有遗忘方法在移除特定数据时会损害模型在保留分布上的性能，需要改善遗忘与保留之间的权衡关系

Method: 提出K-FADE：利用K-FAC等参数化Hessian近似方法，仅在遗忘集上计算少量高斯-牛顿步进行参数更新，将全量保留集的输出约束转化为权重空间的约束，实现最小化对保留集行为的影响

Result: 在WMDP和ToFU基准测试中，K-FADE有效抑制遗忘集输出，输出空间逼近完全重训练效果，对保留集输出的改变小于先前方法，且计算出的遗忘更新可在模型后续训练中复用以廉价维持遗忘状态

Conclusion: K-FADE提供了一种概念简单且高效的LLM遗忘方案，通过高斯-牛顿步与Hessian近似实现了对遗忘集的精准擦除，同时最大限度保持了模型在保留任务上的行为，支持遗忘效果的长期维护

Abstract: Standard large language model training can create models that produce outputs their trainer deems unacceptable in deployment. The probability of these outputs can be reduced using methods such as LLM unlearning. However, unlearning a set of data (called the forget set) can degrade model performance on other distributions where the trainer wants to retain the model's behavior. To improve this trade-off, we demonstrate that using the forget set to compute only a few uphill Gauss-Newton steps provides a conceptually simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach for LLMs. While Gauss-Newton steps adapt Newton's method to non-linear models, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately compute such steps for LLMs. Hence, our approach crucially relies on parametric Hessian approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). We call this combined approach K-FADE (K-FAC for Distribution Erasure). Our evaluation on the WMDP and ToFU benchmarks demonstrates that K-FADE suppresses outputs from the forget set and approximates, in output space, the results of retraining without the forget set. Critically, our method does this while altering the outputs on the retain set less than previous methods. This is because K-FADE transforms a constraint on the model's outputs across the entire retain set into a constraint on the model's weights, allowing the algorithm to minimally change the model's behavior on the retain set at each step. Moreover, the unlearning updates computed by K-FADE can be reapplied later if the model undergoes further training, allowing unlearning to be cheaply maintained.

### [138] [Weight Decay Improves Language Model Plasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11137)
*Tessa Han,Sebastian Bordt,Hanlin Zhang,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了当前大语言模型预训练中仅关注验证损失进行超参数优化的传统范式。研究发现，采用更大的权重衰减值进行预训练虽然可能降低基础模型性能，却通过促进线性可分表征、正则化注意力矩阵和减少过拟合，显著增强了模型在微调时的下游任务适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型开发范式主要关注基础模型的验证损失来优化超参数和制定缩放定律，但这忽略了模型对下游任务的适应能力（可塑性）。作者希望从模型可塑性角度研究预训练过程，以更好地理解超参数（特别是权重衰减）如何影响微调性能。

Method: 通过系统性的大语言模型预训练实验，研究了权重衰减这一关键正则化参数的作用。比较了不同权重衰减值训练的模型，不仅评估预训练损失，更重要的是评估它们通过微调适应下游任务的能力。同时分析了权重衰减对表征、注意力矩阵和过拟合的机制性影响。

Result: 使用更大权重衰减值训练的模型表现出更强的可塑性——微调后下游任务性能提升更显著。这导致了反直觉的权衡：预训练后性能较差的基础模型在微调后反而表现更好。机制上，权重衰减促进了线性可分表征，正则化了注意力矩阵，并减少了过拟合。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了大语言模型预训练中超参数优化不能仅依赖交叉熵损失等传统指标，必须考虑模型可塑性。单个超参数（如权重衰减）在塑造模型行为方面发挥多方面作用，不仅影响泛化能力，还影响下游适应能力，提示未来研究应同时考虑传统指标和可塑性指标。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in large language model (LLM) development is to pretrain a base model, then perform further training to improve performance and model behavior. However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种控制驱动的梯度裁剪策略，通过模型参数的谱分析自适应调整裁剪阈值，避免了传统方法依赖样本梯度统计的高开销问题，同时不增加额外的隐私损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在差分隐私训练中，梯度裁剪阈值是关键参数，设置不当会导致优化偏差或噪声过大。现有自适应方法依赖样本级梯度统计，计算开销大且对数据和架构敏感，需要一种更高效、通用的自适应裁剪方法。

Method: 设计了一种基于模型参数谱诊断的控制策略：周期性对指定权重矩阵进行谱分解，计算重尾谱指标来评估训练稳定性，通过有界反馈控制器在对数域中乘法更新裁剪阈值。

Result: 该方法仅使用训练产生的参数，阈值更新视为后处理，不增加额外的隐私损失，同时避免了传统方法对梯度统计的依赖和计算开销。

Conclusion: 该控制驱动的谱诊断裁剪策略为差分隐私训练提供了高效、自适应的阈值调整方案，在保持隐私保证的同时提升了优化性能。

Abstract: Privacy-preserving training on sensitive data commonly relies on differentially private stochastic optimization with gradient clipping and Gaussian noise. The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting.

TL;DR: 本文指出了现有多模态模型基准测试过度关注"结晶智力"（知识回忆）而忽视"生成性流体智力"（即时推理适应能力）的问题，提出了GENIUS评估套件，将流体智力形式化为三个核心能力，发现模型主要缺陷源于上下文理解不足而非生成能力本身，并提出无训练注意力干预策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型（UMMs）基准测试主要评估依赖知识积累的结晶智力，忽略了生成性流体智力（GFI）——即即时归纳模式、推理约束和适应新场景的能力，这限制了对模型真正通用推理能力的评估。

Method: 提出GENIUS评估套件，将GFI形式化为三个基本能力：1) 归纳隐式模式（如推断个性化视觉偏好）；2) 执行临时约束（如可视化抽象隐喻）；3) 适应上下文知识（如模拟反直觉物理），系统评估12个代表性模型。

Result: 评估显示模型在这些任务上存在显著性能缺陷；诊断分析表明缺陷源于上下文理解能力有限，而非内在生成能力不足；通过无训练注意力干预策略可有效弥补这一差距。

Conclusion: GENIUS为生成性流体智力建立了严格评估标准，推动该领域从知识利用转向动态通用推理，为开发更强大的多模态AI模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual generation. Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess $\textit{Crystallized Intelligence}$, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks $\textit{Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI)}$: the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce $\textbf{GENIUS}$ ($\textbf{GEN}$ Fluid $\textbf{I}$ntelligence Eval$\textbf{U}$ation $\textbf{S}$uite). We formalize $\textit{GFI}$ as a synthesis of three primitives. These include $\textit{Inducing Implicit Patterns}$ (e.g., inferring personalized visual preferences), $\textit{Executing Ad-hoc Constraints}$ (e.g., visualizing abstract metaphors), and $\textit{Adapting to Contextual Knowledge}$ (e.g., simulating counter-intuitive physics). Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes. It demonstrates that deficits stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free attention intervention strategy. Ultimately, $\textbf{GENIUS}$ establishes a rigorous standard for $\textit{GFI}$, guiding the field beyond knowledge utilization toward dynamic, general-purpose reasoning. Our dataset and code will be released at: $\href{https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS}{https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS}$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRACE, a framework that decomposes the performance change when replacing a machine learning model under covariate shift into four interpretable factors, enabling safe and label-efficient model deployment decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When replacing a model trained on original data with one trained on shifted data, performance on the original domain can change unpredictably. The paper aims to understand and quantify this two-model risk change under covariate shift to enable safe model replacement.

Method: TRACE decomposes the absolute risk change |ΔR| into an interpretable upper bound consisting of four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty. The covariate shift penalty combines model sensitivity (from high-quantile input gradients) with a data-shift measure (Optimal Transport by default, MMD as alternative). The model change penalty uses average output distance between models, and generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data.

Result: Validated in linear regression, synthetic, and vision benchmarks, TRACE correctly captures risk change scaling, maintains strong monotonic relationship with true performance degradation, and yields a deployment gate score that strongly correlates with |ΔR| with high AUROC/AUPRC, enabling safe, label-efficient model replacement.

Conclusion: TRACE provides a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding performance changes under covariate shift and facilitates safe model deployment decisions by quantifying risk change through interpretable components.

Abstract: When a source-trained model $Q$ is replaced by a model $\tilde{Q}$ trained on shifted data, its performance on the source domain can change unpredictably. To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $ΔR := R_P(\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|ΔR|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation. Crucially, we derive a deployment gate score that correlates strongly with $|ΔR|$ and achieves high AUROC/AUPRC for gating decisions, enabling safe, label-efficient model replacement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Client drift in non-IID federated learning impairs convergence and model performance.

Method: Introduces RI-FedAvg with a Roughness Index-based regularization term that adaptively penalizes local updates based on loss landscape fluctuations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with higher accuracy and faster convergence in non-IID scenarios.

Conclusion: RI-FedAvg significantly improves robustness and efficiency of federated learning in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet faces challenges in non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings due to client drift, which impairs convergence. We propose RI-FedAvg, a novel FL algorithm that mitigates client drift by incorporating a Roughness Index (RI)-based regularization term into the local objective, adaptively penalizing updates based on the fluctuations of local loss landscapes. This paper introduces RI-FedAvg, leveraging the RI to quantify the roughness of high-dimensional loss functions, ensuring robust optimization in heterogeneous settings. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for non-convex objectives, establishing that RI-FedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that RI-FedAvg outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including FedAvg, FedProx, FedDyn, SCAFFOLD, and DP-FedAvg, achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence in non-IID scenarios. Our results highlight RI-FedAvg's potential to enhance the robustness and efficiency of federated learning in practical, heterogeneous environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因组基础模型在输入表示上存在根本性权衡：标准固定词表标记器会破坏密码子和调控元件等生物学上有意义的基序，而核苷酸级模型虽保持生物学一致性，但对长序列的计算成本过高。

Method: 提出dnaHNet——一种无标记器的自回归模型，采用可微分的动态分块机制，端到端地对基因组序列进行分割和建模，在压缩与预测精度之间取得平衡。

Result: 在原核生物基因组预训练后，dnaHNet在扩展性和效率上优于StripedHyena2等领先架构，实现二次方级别的FLOP降低（较Transformer推理加速>3倍），在零样本任务中对蛋白质变体适应度和基因必需性的预测性能更优，且能无监督地自动发现层次化生物结构。

Conclusion: dnaHNet为下一代基因组建模建立了一个可扩展、可解释的框架。

Abstract: Genomic foundation models have the potential to decode DNA syntax, yet face a fundamental tradeoff in their input representation. Standard fixed-vocabulary tokenizers fragment biologically meaningful motifs such as codons and regulatory elements, while nucleotide-level models preserve biological coherence but incur prohibitive computational costs for long contexts. We introduce dnaHNet, a state-of-the-art tokenizer-free autoregressive model that segments and models genomic sequences end-to-end. Using a differentiable dynamic chunking mechanism, dnaHNet compresses raw nucleotides into latent tokens adaptively, balancing compression with predictive accuracy. Pretrained on prokaryotic genomes, dnaHNet outperforms leading architectures including StripedHyena2 in scaling and efficiency. This recursive chunking yields quadratic FLOP reductions, enabling $>3 \times$ inference speedup over Transformers. On zero-shot tasks, dnaHNet achieves superior performance in predicting protein variant fitness and gene essentiality, while automatically discovering hierarchical biological structures without supervision. These results establish dnaHNet as a scalable, interpretable framework for next-generation genomic modeling.

Conclusion: 瞳孔测量法结合可解释模型可替代EEG实现现实世界的认知负荷监测，支持开发适用于神经精神病学、教育和医疗的平价可穿戴系统。

Abstract: Cognitive load, the mental effort required during working memory, is central to neuroscience, psychology, and human-computer interaction. Accurate assessment is vital for adaptive learning, clinical monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. Physiological signals such as pupillometry and electroencephalography are established biomarkers of cognitive load, but their comparative utility and practical integration as lightweight, wearable monitoring solutions remain underexplored. EEG provides high temporal resolution of neural activity. Although non-invasive, it is technologically demanding and limited in wearability and cost due to its resource-intensive nature, whereas pupillometry is non-invasive, portable, and scalable. Existing studies often rely on deep learning models with limited interpretability and substantial computational expense. This study integrates feature-based and model-driven approaches to advance time-series analysis. Using the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset, this study investigates cognitive load classification from EEG and pupillometry. Feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features and classical machine learning models outperform deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks. The findings demonstrate that pupillometry alone can compete with EEG, serving as a portable and practical proxy for real-world applications. These results challenge the assumption that EEG is necessary for load detection, showing that pupil dynamics combined with interpretable models and SHAP based feature analysis provide physiologically meaningful insights.

TL;DR: 对临床时间序列生成模型进行隐私审计发现，在大数据集上训练的模型能提供强隐私保护，而添加差分隐私反而会降低效用且无实质隐私提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据共享常因患者隐私风险而受限，生成式AI合成数据被视为解决方案，但现有模型无法保证隐私保护。后处理匿名化技术有限，而差分隐私机制会导致训练不稳定和效用损失，因此隐私审计必不可少。

Method: 采用一系列既定隐私攻击对基于MIMIC-IV数据集训练的最先进医院时间序列生成模型进行审计，并利用eICU数据集对MIMIC-IV训练的生成器发起跨数据集隐私攻击。

Result: 当训练数据集足够大时，既定隐私攻击对生成的多元临床时间序列无效；为这些生成器添加差分隐私机制不会提升隐私，反而会降低机器学习预测任务的效用。

Conclusion: 在大型数据集上训练的合成数据生成器能提供稳健的隐私保护；现有差分隐私机制会创造不佳的隐私-效用权衡；无论采用何种隐私机制，对生成式时间序列模型进行综合隐私审计仍是不可或缺的。

Abstract: Sharing medical data for machine learning model training purposes is often impossible due to the risk of disclosing identifying information about individual patients. Synthetic data produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models trained on real data is often seen as one possible solution to comply with privacy regulations. While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一套多维指标来评估合成纵向患者数据的时间结构保持性，揭示边际层面的相似性可能掩盖协方差和个体轨迹的深层失真，并强调单一指标不足以进行全面评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对合成纵向患者数据的评估通常仅关注边际层面的相似性，可能忽略关键的时间结构失真。为确保合成数据在医疗应用中的可靠性，需要能够全面评估时间结构保持性的多维度指标。

Method: 作者提出了一个将时间保持性指标分为四类特征的框架：边际结构、协方差结构、个体层面结构和测量结构。通过分析数据质量、测量频率以及分箱、变量编码和精度等预处理策略对时间保持性的影响。

Result: 研究表明，良好的边际层面相似性可能掩盖协方差模式和个体轨迹的显著失真。测量稀疏或高度不规则的变量提供的信息有限，导致时间依赖关系学习不足，降低合成数据相似性。没有单一指标能充分捕捉时间保持性的全貌。

Conclusion: 对所有四类时间特征进行多维度评估能更全面地衡量合成数据质量。所提出的指标有助于阐明时间结构保持或退化的机制，从而支持更可靠的生成模型评估与改进，促进创建时间上更真实的合成纵向患者数据。

Abstract: This study introduces a set of metrics for evaluating temporal preservation in synthetic longitudinal patient data, defined as artificially generated data that mimic real patients' repeated measurements over time. The proposed metrics assess how synthetic data reproduces key temporal characteristics, categorized into marginal, covariance, individual-level and measurement structures. We show that strong marginal-level resemblance may conceal distortions in covariance and disruptions in individual-level trajectories. Temporal preservation is influenced by factors such as original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies, including binning, variable encoding and precision. Variables with sparse or highly irregular measurement times provide limited information for learning temporal dependencies, resulting in reduced resemblance between the synthetic and original data. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation; instead, a multidimensional evaluation across all characteristics provides a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality. Overall, the proposed metrics clarify how and why temporal structures are preserved or degraded, enabling more reliable evaluation and improvement of generative models and supporting the creation of temporally realistic synthetic longitudinal patient data.

TL;DR: 针对高维、强耦合、稀疏奖励的"大海捞针"优化问题，本文提出一种领域知识引导的贝叶斯优化方法，通过坐标变换解耦参数并对齐活跃子空间，结合反向退火策略，在12维晶体光学系统中成功找到全局最优解，而标准BO、TuRBO等方法均失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化在高维、参数强耦合、目标函数高度不对称且奖励稀疏的复杂系统中性能显著下降，即使TurBO等先进方法也常常失效，难以满足日益复杂的科学仪器自动化调优需求。

Method: 提出领域知识引导的贝叶斯优化框架，利用物理洞察力对坐标系进行变换，将输入特征解耦并使活跃子空间与主要搜索轴对齐；同时引入反向退火探索策略增强全局搜索能力。

Result: 在12维6晶体分束延迟光学系统测试中，所提方法稳定收敛至全局最优；而标准BO、TuRBO和多目标BO均表现不佳。坐标变换是成功的关键，显著加速了搜索过程。

Conclusion: 利用物理洞察力将高维耦合问题转化为简单表示的方法，为大型望远镜、X射线自由电子激光光谱仪等复杂科学仪器的自动化调优提供了一种可推广的范式，可在保留现有算法的同时实现快速稳健的高性能优化。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing complex non-linear systems. However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows. Our results demonstrate a generalizable paradigm: leveraging physical insight to transform high-dimensional, coupled optimization problems into simpler representations can enable rapid and robust automated tuning for consistent high performance while still retaining current optimization algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SnapMLA是一个基于FP8的框架，用于优化多头潜在注意力(MLA)的解码过程，在长上下文场景下通过硬件感知的算法-内核协同优化技术，解决了数值异构性和量化尺度错位等挑战，实现了高达1.91倍的吞吐量提升且性能损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管FP8注意力机制（如FlashAttention-3）展现出巨大前景，但将其集成到DeepSeek的MLA架构解码阶段面临显著挑战：解耦位置嵌入导致的数值异构性、FP8 PV GEMM中的量化尺度错位，以及缺乏优化的系统级支持，这些问题限制了长上下文处理的效率提升。

Method: 本文提出SnapMLA，一个FP8 MLA解码框架，采用硬件感知的算法-内核协同优化技术：(i) RoPE感知的逐token KV量化，通过全面分析MLA KV缓存的异质量化敏感性，保持RoPE部分高精度并使用逐token粒度以匹配自回归解码过程；(ii) 量化PV计算流水线重构，解决MLA KV缓存共享结构导致的FP8 PV计算中量化尺度错位问题；(iii) 端到端数据流优化，使用专用内核建立高效的数据读写工作流。

Result: 在先进MLA大语言模型上的广泛实验表明，SnapMLA实现了高达1.91倍的吞吐量提升，在数学推理和代码生成等具有挑战性的长上下文任务中性能下降风险可忽略不计。

Conclusion: SnapMLA通过算法与内核的协同设计，成功解决了MLA解码中FP8集成的挑战，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了长上下文处理效率，证明了FP8精度用于生产环境大语言模型注意力机制的可行性。

Abstract: While FP8 attention has shown substantial promise in innovations like FlashAttention-3, its integration into the decoding phase of the DeepSeek Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) architecture presents notable challenges. These challenges include numerical heterogeneity arising from the decoupling of positional embeddings, misalignment of quantization scales in FP8 PV GEMM, and the need for optimized system-level support. In this paper, we introduce SnapMLA, an FP8 MLA decoding framework optimized to improve long-context efficiency through the following hardware-aware algorithm-kernel co-optimization techniques: (i) RoPE-Aware Per-Token KV Quantization, where the RoPE part is maintained in high precision, motivated by our comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous quantization sensitivity inherent to the MLA KV cache. Furthermore, per-token granularity is employed to align with the autoregressive decoding process and maintain quantization accuracy. (ii) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction, which resolves the misalignment of quantization scale in FP8 PV computation stemming from the shared KV structure of the MLA KV cache. (iii) End-to-End Dataflow Optimization, where we establish an efficient data read-and-write workflow using specialized kernels, ensuring efficient data flow and performance gains. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLA LLMs show that SnapMLA achieves up to a 1.91x improvement in throughput, with negligible risk of performance degradation in challenging long-context tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文研究奖励随选取次数递增的上升多臂赌博机（RMAB）问题，提出一种显式融合时间范围T的累积奖励估计上界算法CURE‑UCB，理论证明其后悔上界优于不考虑范围的基准策略，并在“线性‑平坦”等结构化环境中实验验证显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多实际场景（如机器人控制、超参数调优）中，每个选项的期望奖励会随着重复使用而提升；然而，现有文献对“时间范围感知”这一关键特性——即最优策略随预算T而变化——探索不足。为此，本文旨在填补这一空白，提出一种能够充分利用T信息的学习算法。

Method: 提出CUmulative Reward Estimation UCB（CURE‑UCB），在标准的UCB框架中引入累积奖励估计，并将时间范围T显式地融入决策过程。通过理论分析，建立了新的后悔上界，并证明在“线性‑平坦”等结构化实例中，CURE‑UCB严格优于所有不考虑T的基准策略。

Result: 理论结果给出CURE‑UCB的后悔上界，显示其在所有T下均保持次线性后悔，并在结构化环境中取得严格更低的后悔值。大量实验进一步验证：相比多种基准算法，CURE‑UCB在累计奖励上显著领先，尤其在T已知的情况下优势更为明显。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了时间范围感知在上升多臂赌博机中的重要性，提出的CURE‑UCB算法通过显式融合T信息，实现了理论保证和实际性能的同步提升。结论鼓励在类似场景（如自动化机器学习、自适应资源分配）中采用此类范围感知的学习策略。

Abstract: The Rising Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) framework models environments where expected rewards of arms increase with plays, which models practical scenarios where performance of each option improves with the repeated usage, such as in robotics and hyperparameter tuning. For instance, in hyperparameter tuning, the validation accuracy of a model configuration (arm) typically increases with each training epoch. A defining characteristic of RMAB is em horizon-dependent optimality: unlike standard settings, the optimal strategy here shifts dramatically depending on the available budget $T$. This implies that knowledge of $T$ yields significantly greater utility in RMAB, empowering the learner to align its decision-making with this shifting optimality. However, the horizon-aware setting remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel CUmulative Reward Estimation UCB (CURE-UCB) that explicitly integrates the horizon. We provide a rigorous analysis establishing a new regret upper bound and prove that our method strictly outperforms horizon-agnostic strategies in structured environments like ``linear-then-flat'' instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant superiority over baselines.

*Tameem Bakr,Anish Ambreth,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种(t,K)-阈值水印方案，用于解决联邦学习中的模型来源证明问题。该方法通过秘密共享水印密钥，确保只有至少t个客户端联盟才能验证水印，既解决了大规模扩展性，又防止单个客户端移除水印，并在K=128规模下保持高鲁棒性和最小准确率损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中K个客户端联合训练模型但不共享原始数据，各参与方投入数据和算力，需要机制证明模型来源。现有模型水印方法存在两个缺陷：一是单客户端水印随K增大而稀释，无法扩展；二是允许单个客户端验证并可能恶意移除水印。

Method: 提出(t,K)-阈值水印：客户端协作嵌入共享水印，仅当至少t个客户端联合时才能重建密钥并验证模型。通过秘密共享技术保护水印密钥τ，使少于t个客户端无法重建，且验证过程无需暴露τ明文。在白盒设置下实现该协议，应用于图像分类任务。

Result: 在K=128的大规模下水印仍保持高检测率，准确率损失极小。面对自适应微调等攻击（使用高达20%训练数据），检测阈值(z≥4)保持稳定，表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该阈值水印方案为联邦学习提供了可扩展且安全的模型来源证明机制，有效解决了现有方法的扩展性和安全性问题，对实际攻击具有强抵抗力。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), $K$ clients jointly train a model without sharing raw data. Because each participant invests data and compute, clients need mechanisms to later prove the provenance of a jointly trained model. Model watermarking embeds a hidden signal in the weights, but naive approaches either do not scale with many clients as per-client watermarks dilute as $K$ grows, or give any individual client the ability to verify and potentially remove the watermark. We introduce $(t,K)$-threshold watermarking: clients collaboratively embed a shared watermark during training, while only coalitions of at least $t$ clients can reconstruct the watermark key and verify a suspect model. We secret-share the watermark key $τ$ so that coalitions of fewer than $t$ clients cannot reconstruct it, and verification can be performed without revealing $τ$ in the clear. We instantiate our protocol in the white-box setting and evaluate on image classification. Our watermark remains detectable at scale ($K=128$) with minimal accuracy loss and stays above the detection threshold ($z\ge 4$) under attacks including adaptive fine-tuning using up to 20% of the training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出RePO方法解决LLM领域对齐问题，通过将离线知识改写为符合自身分布的策略轨迹，动态替换低奖励采样，在保持训练稳定性的同时提升难样本利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM领域对齐方法存在根本矛盾：监督微调会损失泛化能力，在线强化学习难以吸收超越当前推理能力的难样本，而离线强化学习虽能利用难样本却面临严重的训练不稳定问题。需要一种既能有效吸收离线知识又能保持训练稳定性的方法。

Method: RePO（Rephrasing Policy Optimization）方法：1）引导策略模型先理解离线知识；2）将其改写成符合自身风格和参数分布的高质量轨迹；3）动态地将低奖励的在线采样替换为这些改写后的轨迹。这种方式在不改变在线训练动态的前提下，引导模型走向正确的推理路径。

Result: 在多个基准测试上，RePO显著提升了难样本的利用率，明显优于现有基线方法，取得了state-of-the-art的性能表现。

Conclusion: RePO成功 reconciling 了有效的离线知识吸收与在线RL的训练稳定性，为领域特定的LLM对齐提供了一种新的有效解决方案，在保持模型泛化能力的同时显著提升了难样本处理能力。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific data remains a fundamental challenge. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers a straightforward way to inject domain knowledge but often degrades the model's generality. In contrast, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) preserves generality but fails to effectively assimilate hard samples that exceed the model's current reasoning level. Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution. RePO dynamically replaces low-reward rollouts with these rephrased, high-quality trajectories. This strategy guides the model toward correct reasoning paths while strictly preserving on-policy training dynamics. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that RePO improves hard-sample utilization and outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 标准平均损失训练导致小样本/难学习组性能差，现有最坏组优化方法在差分隐私中引发隐私保障不均（少数群体隐私更弱）的问题

Method: 提出ASC算法：动态控制各组的采样率（增加难学习组采样）和梯度裁剪阈值，确保所有组隐私保障一致

Result: 相比先前方法：梯度方差更低、隐私保障更严格、最差组准确率显著提升，且未牺牲整体平均准确率

Conclusion: ASC解决了差分隐私中最坏组优化的隐私不均问题，在保持平均性能的同时提升最差群体表现，优于现有方案

Abstract: Models trained by minimizing the average loss often fail to be accurate on small or hard-to-learn groups of the data. Various methods address this issue by optimizing a weighted objective that focuses on the worst-performing groups. However, this approach becomes problematic when learning with differential privacy, as unequal data weighting can result in inhomogeneous privacy guarantees, in particular weaker privacy for minority groups. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups. Comparing ASC to prior work, we show that it results in lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively studied for tasks like math competitions, complex coding, and scientific reasoning, yet their ability to accurately represent and simulate physical scenarios via code remains underexplored. We propose SimuScene, the first systematic study that trains and evaluates LLMs on simulating physical scenarios across five physics domains and 52 physical concepts. We build an automatic pipeline to collect data, with human verification to ensure quality. The final dataset contains 7,659 physical scenarios with 334 human-verified examples as the test set. We evaluated 10 contemporary LLMs and found that even the strongest model achieves only a 21.5% pass rate, demonstrating the difficulty of the task. Finally, we introduce a reinforcement learning pipeline with visual rewards that uses a vision-language model as a judge to train textual models. Experiments show that training with our data improves physical simulation via code while substantially enhancing general code generation performance.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在最小化的一比特反馈（赌博机反馈）条件下，学习n维累积分布函数（CDF）到误差ε的样本复杂度问题，证明了其样本复杂度呈现近维度不变性：在任意精细网格上，样本量为1/ε³·log(1/ε)^O(n)时可获得一致ε逼近，维度n仅出现在对数因子中。这一结果将多元DKW不等式从全反馈扩展到赌博机反馈，并为小市场固定价格机制学习提供了紧样本复杂度界和新的遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在统计学习和机制设计中，通常需要学习高维分布函数，但实际观测往往受限于最小反馈（如仅能获得一比特信息）。现有的多元DKW不等式仅适用于"全反馈"场景，无法直接应用于反馈受限的"赌博机反馈"设置。本文旨在填补这一空白，建立高维CDF学习在受限反馈下的样本复杂度理论。

Method: 通过设计针对一比特反馈的采样和学习算法，利用精细网格上的分布估计技术，结合极小化极大分析和维度无关的复杂度控制方法，证明在赌博机反馈下仍能实现与全反馈近似的样本效率。

Result: 获得了近维度不变的样本复杂度界：1/ε³·log(1/ε)^O(n)，表明维度n仅对样本复杂度产生对数级影响，而非多项式级影响。这一结果与全反馈下的多元DKW不等式形成对应。

Conclusion: 本文成功将多元DKW不等式扩展到赌博机反馈设置，揭示了高维CDF学习在受限信息下的内在效率。作为直接应用，该理论结果为小市场固定价格机制（如双边交易）提供了紧的样本复杂度界和新的遗憾保证，表明在反馈受限环境下仍可实现高效的机制学习。

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of learning a uniform approximation of an $n$-dimensional cumulative distribution function (CDF) within an error $ε> 0$, when observations are restricted to a minimal one-bit feedback. This serves as a counterpart to the multivariate DKW inequality under ''full feedback'', extending it to the setting of ''bandit feedback''. Our main result shows a near-dimensional-invariance in the sample complexity: we get a uniform $ε$-approximation with a sample complexity $\frac{1}{ε^3}{\log\left(\frac 1 ε\right)^{\mathcal{O}(n)}}$ over a arbitrary fine grid, where the dimensionality $n$ only affects logarithmic terms. As direct corollaries, we provide tight sample complexity bounds and novel regret guarantees for learning fixed-price mechanisms in small markets, such as bilateral trade settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We propose Natural Hypergradient Descent (NHGD), a computationally efficient bilevel optimization method that replaces Hessian inversion with empirical Fisher matrix approximation, enabling parallel updates and matching state-of-the-art theoretical guarantees while reducing computation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bilevel optimization faces computational bottlenecks in hypergradient estimation due to expensive Hessian inverse calculations, limiting scalability in large-scale machine learning.

Method: NHGD uses empirical Fisher information matrix as an asymptotically consistent Hessian surrogate, enabling a parallel optimize-and-approximate framework where the Hessian-inverse approximation is synchronously updated with inner optimization, reusing gradient information at low cost.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows NHGD achieves matching high-probability error bounds and sample complexity as state-of-the-art methods with significantly reduced computational overhead. Empirical evaluations demonstrate superior scalability and effectiveness on large-scale bilevel learning tasks.

Conclusion: NHGD provides a practical and scalable solution for bilevel optimization, effectively addressing computational challenges while maintaining theoretical rigor.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Natural Hypergradient Descent (NHGD), a new method for solving bilevel optimization problems. To address the computational bottleneck in hypergradient estimation--namely, the need to compute or approximate Hessian inverse--we exploit the statistical structure of the inner optimization problem and use the empirical Fisher information matrix as an asymptotically consistent surrogate for the Hessian. This design enables a parallel optimize-and-approximate framework in which the Hessian-inverse approximation is updated synchronously with the stochastic inner optimization, reusing gradient information at negligible additional cost. Our main theoretical contribution establishes high-probability error bounds and sample complexity guarantees for NHGD that match those of state-of-the-art optimize-then-approximate methods, while significantly reducing computational time overhead. Empirical evaluations on representative bilevel learning tasks further demonstrate the practical advantages of NHGD, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness in large-scale machine learning settings.

Motivation: 标准BPTT在长序列训练中存在计算和内存开销大的问题，截断BPTT作为实用替代方案缺乏理论精度分析

Method: 建立子序列优化的理论精度与性能边界，通过系统辨识和时间序列预测基准实验验证预热阶段的影响

Result: 理论证明预热阶段显著影响性能保证；实验显示合理调优预热阶段可使训练/测试数据预测误差降低超60%

Conclusion: RNN训练中预热阶段是重要调参旋钮，其合理设置能显著提升截断BPTT训练效果，为实际训练提供关键优化方向

Abstract: Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with standard backpropagation through time (BPTT) can be challenging, especially in the presence of long input sequences. A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence. This reveals that the burn-in phase of the RNN is an important tuning knob in its training, with significant impact on the performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting. In all experiments, we observe a strong influence of the burn-in phase on the training process, and proper tuning can lead to a reduction of the prediction error on the training and test data of more than 60% in some cases.

TL;DR: Proposing FlexDOME, a new safe RL algorithm that achieves near-constant constraint violation, sublinear regret, and fast convergence in constrained environments, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing primal-dual methods for safe RL in CMDPs either cause growing constraint violations or only achieve average-iterate convergence due to oscillations, which is problematic under strong metrics that forbid error cancellation.

Method: FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization into a primal-dual framework, using term-wise asymptotic dominance scheduling and policy-dual Lyapunov arguments for theoretical guarantees.

Result: First algorithm to provably achieve near-constant $\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation, sublinear strong regret, and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence simultaneously in CMDPs.

Conclusion: FlexDOME successfully addresses safety-efficiency tradeoffs in online RL by delivering strong safety guarantees (constant violation), learning efficiency (sublinear regret), and rapid convergence (last-iterate), advancing safe RL for constrained environments.

Abstract: We study safe online reinforcement learning in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under strong regret and violation metrics, which forbid error cancellation over time. Existing primal-dual methods that achieve sublinear strong reward regret inevitably incur growing strong constraint violation or are restricted to average-iterate convergence due to inherent oscillations. To address these limitations, we propose the Flexible safety Domain Optimization via Margin-regularized Exploration (FlexDOME) algorithm, the first to provably achieve near-constant $\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence. FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework. Our theoretical analysis relies on a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy, where the safety margin is rigorously scheduled to asymptotically majorize the functional decay rates of the optimization and statistical errors, thereby clamping cumulative violations to a near-constant level. Furthermore, we establish non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees via a policy-dual Lyapunov argument. Experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 提出一种合作随机最优控制框架来实现多预训练扩散模型的组合生成，将模型视为交互智能体，通过最优控制联合引导其扩散轨迹朝向聚合输出的共享目标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合生成方法依赖概率密度的代数运算（如乘积或专家混合），需显式知晓目标分布，这在实际中几乎不可能，因此需要新范式

Method: 将组合生成问题重新表述为合作随机最优控制问题，将预训练扩散模型作为交互智能体，通过最优控制联合优化其扩散轨迹，使其聚合输出达成共享目标

Result: 在条件MNIST生成任务上验证框架，并与基于每步梯度引导的朴素DPS推理基线进行对比

Conclusion: 该方法为控制多预训练模型的组合提供了新思路，通过合作控制机制替代传统的概率密度组合方式，展现出更好的实践潜力

Abstract: Continuous-time generative models have achieved remarkable success in image restoration and synthesis. However, controlling the composition of multiple pre-trained models remains an open challenge. Current approaches largely treat composition as an algebraic composition of probability densities, such as via products or mixtures of experts. This perspective assumes the target distribution is known explicitly, which is almost never the case. In this work, we propose a different paradigm that formulates compositional generation as a cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control problem. Rather than combining probability densities, we treat pre-trained diffusion models as interacting agents whose diffusion trajectories are jointly steered, via optimal control, toward a shared objective defined on their aggregated output. We validate our framework on conditional MNIST generation and compare it against a naive inference-time DPS-style baseline replacing learned cooperative control with per-step gradient guidance.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了时序注意力机制中存在对角注意力汇聚（diagonal attention sink）导致的偏差问题，通过理论推导证明其与序列长度的依赖关系，并提出正则化方法有效缓解信息退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时空模型因分析空间结构与时间动态易出现信息退化，现有研究指出因果注意力或时序卷积的过压缩（over-squashing）会导致首令牌偏差，但时序注意力机制是否存在类似偏差尚未被探究。

Method: 推导时序注意力层的雅可比矩阵期望值的敏感性边界，理论分析非对角注意力得分与序列长度的关系，揭示对角注意力汇聚现象。

Result: 证明时序注意力矩阵存在对角注意力汇聚，导致非对角注意力得分受序列长度影响；提出的正则化方法能有效抑制该偏差。

Conclusion: 时序注意力机制存在与序列长度相关的结构性偏差，理论分析与实验均验证所提正则化方法可显著改善模型性能，为设计更鲁棒的时空模型提供新方向。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal models analyze spatial structures and temporal dynamics, which makes them prone to information degeneration among space and time. Prior literature has demonstrated that over-squashing in causal attention or temporal convolutions creates a bias on the first tokens. To analyze whether such a bias is present in temporal attention mechanisms, we derive sensitivity bounds on the expected value of the Jacobian of a temporal attention layer. We theoretically show how off-diagonal attention scores depend on the sequence length, and that temporal attention matrices suffer a diagonal attention sink. We suggest regularization methods, and experimentally demonstrate their effectiveness.

Conclusion: 为稀疏大模型提供可扩展的精准知识编辑基础方案，验证路由稳定干预对MoE架构的关键作用

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) enables precise modifications to factual content in large language models (LLMs). Existing KE methods are largely designed for dense architectures, limiting their applicability to the increasingly prevalent sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models that underpin modern scalable LLMs. Although MoEs offer strong efficiency and capacity scaling, naively adapting dense-model editors is both computationally costly and prone to routing distribution shifts that undermine stability and consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce MoEEdit, the first routing-stable framework for parameter-modifying knowledge editing in MoE LLMs. Our method reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections that keep router inputs invariant and thereby suppress routing shifts. The resulting block-structured optimization is solved efficiently with a block coordinate descent (BCD) solver. Experiments show that MoEEdit attains state-of-the-art efficacy and generalization while preserving high specificity and routing stability, with superior compute and memory efficiency. These results establish a robust foundation for scalable, precise knowledge editing in sparse LLMs and underscore the importance of routing-stable interventions.

### [161] [A Jointly Efficient and Optimal Algorithm for Heteroskedastic Generalized Linear Bandits with Adversarial Corruptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10971)
*Sanghwa Kim,Junghyun Lee,Se-Young Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对存在对抗性污染的异方差广义线性老虎机问题，提出了一种计算高效的算法HCW-GLB-OMD，并在自和谐假设下证明了其遗憾界达到了实例级极小化最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异方差广义线性老虎机（GLBs）涵盖了异方差线性老虎机、逻辑回归/泊松老虎机等重要场景。在实际应用中，数据往往同时存在异方差性（方差随输入变化）和对抗性污染（恶意注入的噪声）。现有方法要么无法同时处理这两种情况，要么计算开销过大。因此，亟需开发一种既能抵抗对抗性污染、又能适应异方差噪声且计算高效的算法。

Method: 提出HCW-GLB-OMD算法，核心创新在于结合了两个组件：(1) 基于在线镜像下降（OMD）的参数估计器；(2) 基于Hessian矩阵信息的置信权重机制，用于自动适应异方差噪声并增强对对抗性污染的鲁棒性。算法仅需O(1)的存储空间和每轮计算复杂度。

Result: 在链接函数满足自和谐假设的条件下，获得了遗憾界 $\tilde{O}\left( d \sqrt{\sum_t g(τ_t) \dotμ_{t,\star}} + d^2 g_{\max} κ+ d κC \right)$，并补充了一个匹配的下界 $\tildeΩ(d \sqrt{\sum_t g(τ_t) \dotμ_{t,\star}} + d C)$。其中 $d$ 是维度，$g(τ_t)$ 是时变离散度，$C$ 是总对抗预算，$κ$ 是条件数。该上界与下界仅相差一个 $κ$ 因子，表明算法具有接近极小化最优的性能。

Conclusion: HCW-GLB-OMD 算法在异方差GLBs问题族上实现了统一的实例级极小化最优遗憾界，同时保持了O(1)的计算和存储效率，具有重要的理论和应用价值。对抗项中的 $κ$ 因子仍是未来改进的方向。

Abstract: We consider the problem of heteroskedastic generalized linear bandits (GLBs) with adversarial corruptions, which subsumes various stochastic contextual bandit settings, including heteroskedastic linear bandits and logistic/Poisson bandits. We propose HCW-GLB-OMD, which consists of two components: an online mirror descent (OMD)-based estimator and Hessian-based confidence weights to achieve corruption robustness. This is computationally efficient in that it only requires ${O}(1)$ space and time complexity per iteration. Under the self-concordance assumption on the link function, we show a regret bound of $\tilde{O}\left( d \sqrt{\sum_t g(τ_t) \dotμ_{t,\star}} + d^2 g_{\max} κ+ d κC \right)$, where $\dotμ_{t,\star}$ is the slope of $μ$ around the optimal arm at time $t$, $g(τ_t)$'s are potentially exogenously time-varying dispersions (e.g., $g(τ_t) = σ_t^2$ for heteroskedastic linear bandits, $g(τ_t) = 1$ for Bernoulli and Poisson), $g_{\max} = \max_{t \in [T]} g(τ_t)$ is the maximum dispersion, and $C \geq 0$ is the total corruption budget of the adversary. We complement this with a lower bound of $\tildeΩ(d \sqrt{\sum_t g(τ_t) \dotμ_{t,\star}} + d C)$, unifying previous problem-specific lower bounds. Thus, our algorithm achieves, up to a $κ$-factor in the corruption term, instance-wise minimax optimality simultaneously across various instances of heteroskedastic GLBs with adversarial corruptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method called Joint Self-Improvement uses a combined generative-predictive model and self-improving sampling to design better molecules more efficiently, outperforming existing techniques under limited testing budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of sample inefficiency and distribution shift in generative molecular optimization, where creating and evaluating new molecules is costly and surrogate models become less accurate as they venture into new chemical spaces.

Method: The proposed Joint Self-Improvement method utilizes (i) a joint generative-predictive model to align the generator with the surrogate and reduce distribution shift, and (ii) a self-improving sampling scheme that uses the predictive part to guide the generative part during molecule generation.

Result: Experiments on both offline and online molecular optimization benchmarks show that Joint Self-Improvement achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods when the number of available molecular evaluations is limited.

Conclusion: By integrating generation and prediction in a self-improving loop, the method provides a more sample-efficient solution for molecular design, effectively addressing key practical challenges in the field.

Abstract: Generative molecular optimization aims to design molecules with properties surpassing those of existing compounds. However, such candidates are rare and expensive to evaluate, yielding sample efficiency essential. Additionally, surrogate models introduced to predict molecule evaluations, suffer from distribution shift as optimization drives candidates increasingly out-of-distribution. To address these challenges, we introduce Joint Self-Improvement, which benefits from (i) a joint generative-predictive model and (ii) a self-improving sampling scheme. The former aligns the generator with the surrogate, alleviating distribution shift, while the latter biases the generative part of the joint model using the predictive one to efficiently generate optimized molecules at inference-time. Experiments across offline and online molecular optimization benchmarks demonstrate that Joint Self-Improvement outperforms state-of-the-art methods under limited evaluation budgets.

*Abhishek Vijaya Kumar,Bhaskar Kataria,Byungsoo Oh,Emaad Manzoor,Rachee Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TVCACHE，一个用于LLM智能体RL后训练的状态化工具值缓存系统，通过维护工具调用序列树并进行最长前缀匹配，在保证环境状态一致性的前提下实现高达70%的缓存命中率，将工具调用执行时间中位数降低6.9倍，且不损害训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM智能体的强化学习后训练过程中，外部工具调用耗时数秒至数分钟，导致GPU空闲并显著增加训练时间和成本。尽管并行推演中许多工具调用会重复出现，但直接缓存复用是错误的，因为工具输出依赖于前序智能体交互产生的环境状态。

Method: TVCACHE维护一个观测到的工具调用序列树，并采用最长前缀匹配进行缓存查找：只有当智能体的完整工具历史与已执行序列完全匹配时才会命中缓存，从而确保环境状态完全一致。

Result: 在三大多样化工作负载（终端任务、SQL生成、视频理解）上，TVCACHE实现了高达70%的缓存命中率，将工具调用执行时间中位数降低最多6.9倍，且未造成后训练奖励积累的任何下降。

Conclusion: TVCACHE通过状态感知的智能缓存策略，有效解决了LLM智能体后训练中的工具调用瓶颈问题，显著提升了训练效率并降低成本，同时保持了训练质量。

Abstract: In RL post-training of LLM agents, calls to external tools take several seconds or even minutes, leaving allocated GPUs idle and inflating post-training time and cost. While many tool invocations repeat across parallel rollouts and could in principle be cached, naively caching their outputs for reuse is incorrect since tool outputs depend on the environment state induced by prior agent interactions. We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state. On three diverse workloads-terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding. TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.

*Xinyu Yuan,Yan Qiao,Zonghui Wang,Wenzhi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pram is an ML-based method using multimodal language models and multi-agent reinforcement learning to solve multi-commodity flow problems, achieving near-optimal solutions 10-100x faster than traditional LP solvers while maintaining robustness under network failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of allocation systems creates challenges for balancing optimality and tractability in multi-commodity flow problems, which existing optimization engines struggle with.

Method: Pram divides MCF problems into local subproblems solved by MLM-powered agents, then uses multi-agent reinforcement learning to harmonize these solutions for global consistency.

Result: Pram achieves performance comparable to linear programming solvers (very close to optimal) with 1-2 orders of magnitude faster runtime, and shows strong robustness (<10% performance degradation) under link failures and flow bursts.

Conclusion: Pram provides a practical, scalable, and objective-agnostic solution for future networks, demonstrating that MLMs can effectively generalize to unforeseen events in combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: The multi-commodity flow (MCF) problem is a fundamental topic in network flow and combinatorial optimization, with broad applications in transportation, communication, and logistics, etc. Nowadays, the rapid expansion of allocation systems has posed challenges for existing optimization engines in balancing optimality and tractability. In this paper, we present Pram, the first ML-based method that leverages the reasoning power of multimodal language models (MLMs) for addressing the trade-off dilemma -- a great need of service providers. As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered "agent", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster). Moreover, Pram exhibits strong robustness (<10\% performance degradation under link failures or flow bursts), demonstrating MLM's generalization ability to unforeseen events. Pram is objective-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with mainstream allocation systems, providing a practical and scalable solution for future networks.

Motivation: 可穿戴式人体活动识别需要大规模数据但真实数据采集不可行，而合成数据预训练存在迁移可靠性问题，特别是在全身人体动作领域，需要探索合成运动数据的有效性和局限性。

Method: 利用动作捕捉衍生的表示生成合成运动数据，预训练运动时间序列模型，并在多样化的下游HAR任务上评估其迁移性能。

Result: 合成数据预训练在与真实数据混合或充分扩展时能提升泛化能力；大规模动作捕捉预训练由于与可穿戴信号存在域不匹配，仅带来边际增益。

Conclusion: 研究明确了从仿真到现实的挑战，揭示了合成运动数据在可迁移HAR表示中的局限性和机会，强调了域匹配在合成数据预训练中的关键作用。

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a compelling path to scalable pretraining when real-world data is scarce, but models pretrained on synthetic data often fail to transfer reliably to deployment settings. We study this problem in full-body human motion, where large-scale data collection is infeasible but essential for wearable-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and where synthetic motion can be generated from motion-capture-derived representations. We pretrain motion time-series models using such synthetic data and evaluate their transfer across diverse downstream HAR tasks. Our results show that synthetic pretraining improves generalisation when mixed with real data or scaled sufficiently. We also demonstrate that large-scale motion-capture pretraining yields only marginal gains due to domain mismatch with wearable signals, clarifying key sim-to-real challenges and the limits and opportunities of synthetic motion data for transferable HAR representations.

Motivation: 现有LLM远程变更检测方法部署成本过高，或需白盒/灰盒访问权限，难以在仅有黑盒访问的实际场景中应用。

Method: 提出黑盒边界输入追踪（B3IT）方案，利用低温度状态下模型Jacobian和Fisher信息的统计分析，通过识别具有多个高概率输出令牌的"边界输入"来检测模型变化。

Result: 实验表明，非推理型模型的边界输入易于发现，B3IT性能与最佳灰盒方法相当，成本降低30倍，且能在严格黑盒环境下运行。

Conclusion: B3IT证明利用边界输入可在黑盒访问条件下实现高效LLM变更检测，为实际应用提供了经济可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote change detection in LLMs is a difficult problem. Existing methods are either too expensive for deployment at scale, or require initial white-box access to model weights or grey-box access to log probabilities. We aim to achieve both low cost and strict black-box operation, observing only output tokens.
  Our approach hinges on specific inputs we call Border Inputs, for which there exists more than one output top token. From a statistical perspective, optimal change detection depends on the model's Jacobian and the Fisher information of the output distribution. Analyzing these quantities in low-temperature regimes shows that border inputs enable powerful change detection tests.
  Building on this insight, we propose the Black-Box Border Input Tracking (B3IT) scheme. Extensive in-vivo and in-vitro experiments show that border inputs are easily found for non-reasoning tested endpoints, and achieve performance on par with the best available grey-box approaches. B3IT reduces costs by $30\times$ compared to existing methods, while operating in a strict black-box setting.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示生成式模型在离线多目标优化中虽然超体积指标表现良好，但在世代距离等其他指标上系统性表现不佳，原因是"离线前沿偏移"现象。作者提出这本质上是分布偏移问题，生成式方法过于保守地停留在训练数据分布附近，需要更激进的外部分布采样策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式方法（如扩散模型）在离线MOO的超体积指标上表现优异，但其对其他经典MOO指标的行为特征尚不明确，存在性能认知盲区。

Method: 通过分析离线数据集与帕累托前沿的偏移现象（离线前沿偏移），引入积分概率度量来实现目标空间的外部分布采样，并系统对比生成式与进化算法在多指标上的表现差异。

Result: 生成式方法在世代距离等指标上系统性逊于进化算法；实证发现生成式模型在目标空间中过于保守，难以突破离线数据集的分布限制，离线前沿偏移构成根本性瓶颈。

Conclusion: 离线MOO应被重新定位为分布偏移受限问题，该框架为诊断生成式优化方法的失效提供了理论透镜，未来需设计更积极的外部分布探索机制来克服前沿偏移。

Abstract: Offline multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to recover Pareto-optimal designs given a finite, static dataset. Recent generative approaches, including diffusion models, show strong performance under hypervolume, yet their behavior under other established MOO metrics is less understood. We show that generative methods systematically underperform evolutionary alternatives with respect to other metrics, such as generational distance. We relate this failure mode to the offline-frontier shift, i.e., the displacement of the offline dataset from the Pareto front, which acts as a fundamental limitation in offline MOO. We argue that overcoming this limitation requires out-of-distribution sampling in objective space (via an integral probability metric) and empirically observe that generative methods remain conservatively close to the offline objective distribution. Our results position offline MOO as a distribution-shift--limited problem and provide a diagnostic lens for understanding when and why generative optimization methods fail.

*Reinhard Heckel,Mahdi Soltanolkotabi,Christos Thramboulidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes asymmetric prompt weighting in RL for LLMs, prioritizing hard prompts with near-zero success rates to accelerate training convergence, especially in from-scratch scenarios like R1-Zero.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, RLOO) underutilize hard prompts with low/zero success probability by downweighting them, limiting efficiency in training LLMs for reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces asymmetric prompt weighting that assigns higher weights to prompts with low empirical success rates. Combines empirical evaluation on from-scratch RL (R1-Zero) and post-SFT RL with theoretical analysis of optimal weights under fixed update budgets.

Result: Asymmetric weighting significantly improves effective-time convergence in low-success regimes (e.g., from-scratch RL) by accelerating accuracy gains. Post-SFT RL shows less benefit due to already high initial accuracy.

Conclusion: Optimal prompt weighting should be asymmetric in low-success scenarios to maximize training efficiency. This strategy is particularly impactful for RL from scratch where the model traverses wide accuracy ranges.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has driven recent advances in LLM post-training, in particular for reasoning. Policy optimization algorithms generate a number of responses for a given prompt and then effectively weight the corresponding gradients depending on the rewards. The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget. In low-success regimes, where informative responses are rare and response cost dominates, these optimal weights become asymmetric, upweighting low success probabilities and thereby accelerating effective-time convergence.

Result: 在数学推理、通用问答和科学理解等基准测试中实现最优效率提升，大幅减少扩散步数且保持生成质量

Conclusion: 该 token 级早停方法有效解决扩散模型计算冗余问题，为提升生成效率提供通用解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion language models generate text through iterative refinement, a process that is often computationally inefficient because many tokens reach stability long before the final denoising step. We introduce a training-free, token-level early stopping approach that identifies convergence independently at each position. Our method leverages lightweight signals derived from the model's predictions and local context to dynamically determine when individual tokens can be finalized. This yields adaptive per-token freezing without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the total number of diffusion steps required. Across diverse benchmarks, spanning mathematical reasoning, general question answering, and scientific understanding, our approach achieves state-of-the-art efficiency gains while preserving generation quality.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models, such as TabPFNv2 and TabICL, have recently dethroned gradient-boosted trees at the top of predictive benchmarks, demonstrating the value of in-context learning for tabular data. We introduce TabICLv2, a new state-of-the-art foundation model for regression and classification built on three pillars: (1) a novel synthetic data generation engine designed for high pretraining diversity; (2) various architectural innovations, including a new scalable softmax in attention improving generalization to larger datasets without prohibitive long-sequence pretraining; and (3) optimized pretraining protocols, notably replacing AdamW with the Muon optimizer. On the TabArena and TALENT benchmarks, TabICLv2 without any tuning surpasses the performance of the current state of the art, RealTabPFN-2.5 (hyperparameter-tuned, ensembled, and fine-tuned on real data). With only moderate pretraining compute, TabICLv2 generalizes effectively to million-scale datasets under 50GB GPU memory while being markedly faster than RealTabPFN-2.5. We provide extensive ablation studies to quantify these contributions and commit to open research by first releasing inference code and model weights at https://github.com/soda-inria/tabicl, with synthetic data engine and pretraining code to follow.
