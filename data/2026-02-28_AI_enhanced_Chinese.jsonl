This method combines a transition-state-oriented bias potential, expressed as a functional of the committor, with a metadynamics-like bias along a committor-based collective variable, enabling uniform exploration of reaction pathways. In its original formulation, the committor is represented by a neural network that takes physical descriptors as input and is trained by minimizing a functional involving gradients with respect to atomic coordinates, which can be computationally demanding in some cases. Here, we propose a simplified learning criterion formulated entirely in the descriptor space, which bypasses the need for explicit and costly coordinate gradients and provides a relaxed upper bound to the original variational principle.

However, the realization of these phases remains limited in van der Waals materials, and the full landscape of strong correlations remains uncharted in any context. While interactions between conduction electrons and localized spins yield a well-known competition between heavy fermions (Kondo hybridization) and magnetic order (RKKY exchange), such spin-driven competition represents only part of the correlated electron phase diagram. Here we demonstrate that a heavy-fermion state can also compete with charge order, such as the charge density wave (CDW) state typical in the van der Waals $4f$ rare-earth tritellurides (RTe$_3$). We exploit the spatially-extended $5f$ orbitals of $\u03b2$-UTe$_3$ to enhance Kondo hybridization compared to its isostructural RTe$_3$ cousins. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy on $\u03b2$-UTe$_3$ shows Fano resonances characteristic of the heavy fermion state, while our quasiparticle interference imaging reveals the disappearance of Fermi-level nesting and the appearance of flat bands.

As a step towards this goal, we consider the massive Thirring and Gross--Neveu models with arbitrary number of fermion flavors, $N_f$, discretized on a spatial one-dimensional lattice of size $L$ in the Hamiltonian formulation. We compute the gate complexity using the higher-order product formula and using block-encoding/qubitization and quantum singular value transformations in the limit of large $N_f$ and $L$. We also prepare the ground states of both models with excellent fidelity for system sizes up to 20 qubits with $N_f = 1,2,3,4$ using the adaptive-variational quantum imaginary time algorithm. In addition, we also classify the dynamical Lie algebras of these relativistic fermionic models and show that they belong to the same isomorphism class.

Here we focus on the $q$-TASEP in either continuous or discrete time. Each particle on $\\mathbb{Z}$ jumps independently by $+1$ with a rate (or probability) depending on the gap to the next particle on its right. We consider initial conditions (either step or random) which are empty of particles on $\\mathbb{Z}^+$, and focus on the dynamics of the $N$ rightmost particles. In the limit $q \\to 1$ and at large time (and large gaps) we identify a new intermediate \"mesoscopic\" (i.e. finite $N$) regime which corresponds to weak noise. In that regime Poisson noise remains important. We obtain the large deviations of the position of a given particle by two methods. The first derives asymptotics of $q$-TASEP Fredholm determinant formula. The second maps the weak noise limit to a system of semi-discrete or fully discrete, non linear differential equations. These are obtained as saddle point classical equations of a dynamical field theory, and their solutions represent the optimal configurations in the large deviation regime. We show the classical integrability of these two systems, and exhibit their explicit Lax pair.

In multi-orbital systems where bands have strongly mixed orbital composition, quantum geometry plays a vital role in determining the ground state and low-energy properties of interacting electronic systems. In this work, we show that Mott metal-insulator transitions, as well as transitions between different magnetic orders within the Mott insulating phase, can be driven by the quantum geometry of the underlying Bloch band, thereby providing a mechanism complementary to conventional bandwidth-tuned Mott transitions. By studying the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that in in half-filled and topologically-trivial bands, quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states alone can act as a tuning knob for Mott metal-to-insulator and affect the competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. We show that both transitions may be heuristically understood via non-local Coulomb scattering in a basis of exponentially localized Wannier functions.

Starting from its reformulation as a regularized quadratic optimization, we develop a framework to tackle this problem using both classical and quantum-compatible methods. In particular, we derive a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) representation of the unfolding objective, allowing direct implementation on quantum annealing and hybrid quantum-classical solvers. The proposed approach is implemented in QUnfold, an open-source Python package integrating classical mixed-integer solvers and D-Wave's hybrid quantum solver. We benchmark the method against widely used unfolding techniques in RooUnfold, including response Matrix Inversion, Iterative Bayesian Unfolding, and Singular Value Decomposition unfolding, using synthetic dataset with controlled distortion effects. Our results demonstrate that the optimization-based approach achieves competitive reconstruction accuracy across multiple distributions while naturally accommodating regularization within the objective function. This work establishes a unified optimization perspective on unfolding and provides a practical pathway for exploring quantum-enhanced methods in experimental HEP data analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406unfolding\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7ecf\u5178-\u91cf\u5b50\u517c\u5bb9\u6846\u67b6QUnfold\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u626d\u66f2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfcQUBO\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0QUnfold\u5f00\u6e90\u5305\u96c6\u6210\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0eD-Wave\u91cf\u5b50\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u4e0eRooUnfold\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5931\u771f\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u81ea\u7136\u5305\u542b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acbunfolding\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Most important figures are Fig.3 and Fig.4", "summary": "We study when a density-matching Kohn--Sham (KS) description can reproduce a many-body Berry phase in a correlated insulator, despite the fact that geometric phases are functionals of the wave function. Focusing on the one-dimensional SSH--Hubbard chain on a ring as a controlled interacting topological model, we introduce a $U(1)$ twist $\u03b8$ (flux insertion). The many-body ground state along the full twist cycle is computed by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), while the onsite interaction $U$ is tuned from the noninteracting to the strong-coupling regime. At half filling in the inversion-symmetric gapped regime, our DMRG calculations show that the density remains constant within numerical accuracy over the entire $(\u03b8,U)$ range studied. Thus, the density has no dependence on either the flux $\u03b8$ or the interaction strength $U$. Accordingly, the symmetry-preserving density constraint collapses the KS reference to an SSH-type quadratic representative with $U$-independent geometric diagnostics. Nevertheless, the many-body wave function exhibits a nontrivial geometric response: the quantum metric associated with the $\u03b8$-parametrized ground-state manifold depends on $\u03b8$ at intermediate $U$ and is strongly suppressed at large $U$, consistent with the charge fluctuation freezing. Intriguingly, the KS and many-body Berry phases coincide throughout the gapped regime as $U$ is tuned from weak to strong coupling. We show that this agreement is best understood as symmetry-enforced $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector matching, rather than as evidence that the density encodes the many-body Berry connection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4SSH-Hubbard\u94fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u78c1\u901a\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4f46Kohn-Sham\u4e0e\u591a\u4f53Berry\u76f8\u4f4d\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u80fd\u9699\u533a\u91cd\u5408\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5f3a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7684Kohn-Sham\u63cf\u8ff0\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u73b0\u5173\u8054\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4f53Berry\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f4d\u662f\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6cdb\u51fd\u3002\u8fd9\u63a2\u8ba8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u63cf\u8ff0\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4(DMRG)\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u7ef4SSH-Hubbard\u94fe\u5728\u73af\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u63d2\u5165U(1)\u626d\u8f6c\u03b8\u65f6\u7684\u57fa\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5728\u4f4d\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528U\u4ece\u96f6\u8c03\u8282\u5230\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u533a\u3002", "result": "(1) \u5728\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u533a\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5728\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5185\u4e0e\u03b8\u548cU\u5747\u65e0\u5173\uff1b(2) KS\u53c2\u8003\u4f53\u7cfb\u574d\u7f29\u4e3aU\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u578b\u4ee3\u8868\uff1b(3) \u591a\u4f53\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u5c55\u73b0\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u51e0\u4f55\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49U\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u03b8\uff0c\u5f3aU\u65f6\u88ab\u5f3a\u70c8\u6291\u5236\uff1b(4) KS\u4e0e\u591a\u4f53Berry\u76f8\u4f4d\u5728\u80fd\u9699\u533a\u5168\u7a0b\u91cd\u5408\uff1b(5) \u8fd9\u79cd\u91cd\u5408\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5f3a\u5236\u7684Z\u2082\u6247\u533a\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "KS\u4e0e\u591a\u4f53Berry\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u91cd\u5408\u5e76\u975e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u591a\u4f53Berry\u8054\u7edc\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5f3a\u5236\u7684Z\u2082\u6247\u533a\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Unlike chatbots that respond to isolated queries, AI agents can now read files, run code, query databases, search the web, and invoke domain-specific skills to execute entire research pipelines autonomously. This paper introduces the concept of vibe researching -- the AI-era parallel to ``vibe coding'' (Karpathy, 2025) -- and uses scholar-skill, a 21-skill plugin for Claude Code covering the full research pipeline from idea to submission, as an illustrative case. I develop a cognitive task framework that classifies research activities along two dimensions -- codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement -- to identify a delegation boundary that is cognitive, not sequential: it cuts through every stage of the research pipeline, not between stages. I argue that AI agents excel at speed, coverage, and methodological scaffolding but struggle with theoretical originality and tacit field knowledge.

Conventional approaches to quantum criticality assume overdamped Markovian dissipation governed by Ohmic Landau damping. Here we show that infrared collective dynamics is instead generically controlled by the time--scale density of states (TDOS) of relaxation modes. Within the Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--De Dominicis formalism, we derive an exact spectral representation of the collective susceptibility in terms of the TDOS. A finite infrared TDOS defines a new universality class of memory--dominated critical dynamics characterized by long--time kernels $K(t)\\sim1/t$ and nonanalytic dynamical response. This spectral reorganization produces a strong infrared amplification of the particle--particle channel, converting the marginal instabilities of BCS and Eliashberg theories into algebraic superconducting transitions. As a result, the transition temperature scales linearly with the infrared spectral weight of slow collective modes, naturally yielding superconducting domes and Uemura scaling without invoking bosonic glue or fine tuning. The same slow--mode reservoir governs anomalous normal--state dynamics, including long--time correlations and strange--metal behavior, providing a unified description of thermodynamic and dynamical phenomena in correlated superconductors.

This allows the Hamiltonian topology to act as a knob for controlling Liouvillian topology and corresponding non-equilibrium dynamics, rather than being passively manipulated by system-environment exchanges. In particular, by exactly solving the Liouvillian spectrum in a class of one-dimensional dissipative lattices, we find that the Hamiltonian band topology constrains the Liouvillian spectral winding and determines the Liouvillian skin effect, provided the Hamiltonian and quantum jump operators respect the same chiral symmetry. We further demonstrate that lattice parity controls the associated bulk-boundary correspondence and the coherence properties of the steady state. Our results unveil a symmetry-enforced topological control of spectral and spatial organization in open quantum systems, providing a unified perspective on topology in Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5efa\u7acb\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u80fd\u5e26\u62d3\u6251\u4e0eLindblad\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c31\u7f20\u7ed5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u62d3\u6251\u4e3b\u52a8\u8c03\u63a7\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u683c\u70b9\u5b87\u79f0\u5bf9\u4f53\u8fb9\u5bf9\u5e94\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u62d3\u6251\u5bf9Liouvillian\u8c31\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u88ab\u52a8\u8c03\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u62d3\u6251\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0", "method": "\u5728\u5e7a\u6b63\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u4e00\u7ef4\u8017\u6563\u6676\u683c\u7684Liouvillian\u8c31\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5e26\u62d3\u6251\u4e0eLiouvillian\u8c31\u7f20\u7ed5\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u8df3\u53d8\u7b97\u7b26\u6ee1\u8db3\u76f8\u540c\u624b\u5f81\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5e26\u62d3\u6251\u51b3\u5b9aLiouvillian\u8c31\u7f20\u7ed5\u548c\u8d8b\u80a4\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u683c\u70b9\u5b87\u79f0\u8c03\u63a7\u4f53\u8fb9\u5bf9\u5e94\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u76f8\u5e72\u7279\u6027", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5f3a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u80fd\u5e26\u62d3\u6251\u5230\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u8c31\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u8c03\u63a7"}}

To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging. Together, these findings highlight CogARC as a rich behavioral environment for studying human abstract reasoning, providing insight into how people generalize, misgeneralize, and adapt their strategies under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u6599\u5e93CogARC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08260\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff09\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u738780-90%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3002\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u601d\u8003\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u5e94\u66f4\u5feb\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u662f\u4efb\u52a1\u719f\u6089\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u9519\u8bef\u89e3\u6cd5\u4e5f\u5e38\u5e38\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u4f8b\u5b50\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u4e3a\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u6599\u5e93(CogARC)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u6599\u5e93(ARC)\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6700\u521d\u662f\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u800c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CogARC\uff0c\u8fd9\u662fARC\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u9002\u5e94\u5b50\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5171260\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u81ea\u7531\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8675\u4e2a\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8981\u6c42\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u4f8b\u5b50\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u4ee5\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u793a\u4f8b\u67e5\u770b\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u591a\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u63d0\u4ea4\u3002", "result": "\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6210\u529f\uff08\u5b9e\u9a8c1\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea690%\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c2\u7ea680%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u95ee\u9898\u95f4\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u66f4\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5f15\u53d1\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u601d\u8003\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u6b67\u3002\u968f\u7740\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u542f\u52a8\u53cd\u5e94\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u719f\u6089\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u9519\u8bef\u89e3\u6cd5\u4e5f\u5e38\u5e38\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f4\u63a5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8d8b\u5411\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u5219\u6d89\u53ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a2\u7d22\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u542f\u540e\u624d\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5c06CogARC\u7a81\u51fa\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u884c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u8bef\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6df1\u523b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

In multi-qubit systems, entanglement and magic are the key resources underlying genuinely quantum behaviour. While entanglement is well understood, magic -- essential for universal quantum computation -- remains relatively poorly characterised. Here we show that determining membership in the stabilizer polytope, which defines the free states of magic-state resource theory, requires super-exponential time $\\exp( n^2)$ in the number of qubits $n$, even approximately. We reduce the problem to solving a $3$-SAT instance on $n^2$ variables and, by invoking the exponential time hypothesis, the result follows. As a consequence, both quantifying and certifying magic are fundamentally intractable: any magic monotone for general states must be super-exponentially hard to compute, and deciding whether an operator is a valid magic witness is equally difficult. As a corollary, we establish the robustness of magic as computationally optimal among monotones. This barrier extends even to classically simulable regimes: deciding whether a state lies in the convex hull of states generated by a logarithmic number of non-Clifford gates is also super-exponentially hard. Together, these results reveal intrinsic computational limits on assessing classical simulability, distilling pathological magic states, and ultimately probing and exploiting magic as a quantum resource.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u523b\u753b\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u9b54\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc6\u522b\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5206\u754c\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5728\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u9b54\u6cd5\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u91cf\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u9b54\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5176\u7279\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5f52\u7ea6\u4e3a\u5728n\u00b2\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0a\u6c42\u89e33-SAT\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u7528\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u6210\u5458\u8d44\u683c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4exp(n\u00b2)\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9b54\u6cd5\u5728\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\uff1a\u4efb\u4f55\u9b54\u6cd5\u5355\u8c03\u91cf\u90fd\u5fc5\u987b\u8d85\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u96be\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5224\u65ad\u7b97\u5b50\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u9b54\u6cd5\u89c1\u8bc1\u540c\u6837\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9b54\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5728\u5355\u8c03\u91cf\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e00\u56f0\u96be\u5ef6\u4f38\u81f3\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5224\u65ad\u72b6\u6001\u662f\u5426\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u91cf\u975eClifford\u95e8\u751f\u6210\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u51f8\u5305\u5185\u4e5f\u8d85\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u6027\u3001\u63d0\u53d6\u9b54\u6cd5\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u9b54\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

We propose a probabilistic framework where agents engage in a \\textit{calibration} phase, updating beliefs about their own fixed competence, before facing a final confidence gate that determines whether to vote or abstain. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the group's success probability and prove that this \\textit{selective participation} generalizes the asymptotic guarantees of the CJT to a sequential, confidence-gated setting. Empirically, we validate these bounds via Monte Carlo simulations.

A key limitation in current AI deployments is the reliance on a one-size-fits-all inference strategy where most systems route every request to the same large model, regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial and unnecessary energy waste. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects an appropriate language model based on query complexity. The proposed system uses a Context-Aware Model Switching for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference that combines caching for repeated queries, rulebased complexity scoring for fast and explainable decisions, machine learning classification to capture semantic intent, and a user-adaptive component that learns from interaction patterns over time. The proposed architecture was evaluated using real conversation workloads and three open-source language models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B and Qwen3 4B) with different computational costs, measuring energy consumption (via NVML GPU power telemetry), response latency, routing accuracy, and output quality (BERTScore F1) to reflect real-world usage conditions. Experimental results show that the model switching approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 67.5% compared to always using the largest model while maintaining a response quality of 93.6%. In addition, the response time for simple queries also improved significantly by approximately 68%. These results show that model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating that significant efficiency gains can be achieved without major sacrifices in response quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u630193.6%\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe67.5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8017\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\"\u4e00\u5200\u5207\"\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u8bf7\u6c42\u8def\u7531\u5230\u540c\u4e00\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u80fd\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eedAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b(Gemma3 1B/4B\u548cQwen3 4B)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NVML GPU\u529f\u8017\u9065\u6d4b\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u8017\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u8def\u7531\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf(BERTScore F1)\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe67.5%\uff0c\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u6301\u572893.6%\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u67e5\u8be2\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\u7ea668%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u727a\u7272\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

An analytical solution is obtained for an arbitrary relation between the Hubbard repulsion and crystal field splitting, i.e., interpolating the cases of Mott-Hubbard and charge-transfer insulators. A description of orbital orders is given in terms of octupole moments. The ground-state phase diagram is constructed in the parameter space spanned by spin-orbit coupling, Hund's exchange, and Hubbard interaction. We investigate a quantum phase transition between a state exhibiting hidden magnetic and orbital long-range order and a ferromagnetic state with a reduced magnetic moment accompanied by antiferroorbital order.

A particular feature of the phase diagram is the extended quantum phase transition in the Ashkin-Teller universality class that separates the plaquette phase, which spontaneously breaks translation symmetry, and the uniform disordered phase. The former is connected to the Haldane phase, stabilized by large inter-chain coupling, via the topological Gaussian transition. Upon decreasing the inter-chain interactions, this intermediate disorder phase vanishes, giving place to a dimerized phase separated from the plaquette phase on one side via a non-magnetic Ising transition and from the Haldane phase on the other side by a topological weak first-order transition.

However, existing evaluation practices remain outcome-centric, focusing primarily on final task performance. Through a review of prior work, we find that none of the surveyed agentic AutoML systems report structured, decision-level evaluation metrics intended for post-hoc assessment of intermediate decision quality. To address this limitation, we propose an Evaluation Agent (EA) that performs decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents without interfering with their execution. The EA is designed as an observer that evaluates intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact.

It targets process component monitoring and its predictive maintenance in order to ensure safety, uninterrupted production and maintain high efficiency level. The rise of advanced tools for the simulation of physical systems in addition to data-driven machine learning models offers the possibility to design numerical tools dedicated to efficient system monitoring. In that respect, the digital twin concept presents an adequate framework that proffers solution to these challenges. The main purpose of this paper is to develop such a digital twin dedicated to fault detection and diagnosis in the context of a thermal-hydraulic process supervision. Based on a numerical simulation of the system, in addition to machine learning methods, we propose different modules dedicated to process parameter change detection and their on-line estimation. The proposed fault detection and diagnosis algorithm is validated on a specific test scenario, with single one-off parameter change occurrences in the system.

Powder and single-crystal neutron diffraction reveals incommensurate cycloidal antiferromagnetic order in Ce3TiBi5 with propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0.388) and a reduced ordered moment of m = 0.53(3)$\u03bc_{B}$. Ce3ZrBi5 exhibits a qualitatively similar magnetic diffraction profile, with k $\\simeq$ (0, 0, 0.37). Inelastic neutron scattering measurements resolve two clear, well-separated CEF excitations in both compounds with nearly the same profile, confirming a well-isolated Kramers doublet ground state.

Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top.

However, this sequential pipeline fails to leverage the intricate interaction between quantization bit-width and LoRA rank. Specifically, a carefully optimized quantization allocation with low quantization error does not always translate to strong fine-tuning performance, and different bit-width and rank configurations can lead to significantly varying outcomes under the same memory budget. To address this limitation, we propose AutoQRA, a joint optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes the bit-width and LoRA rank configuration for each layer during the mixed quantized fine-tuning process. To tackle the challenges posed by the large discrete search space and the high evaluation cost associated with frequent fine-tuning iterations, AutoQRA decomposes the optimization process into two stages. First, it first conducts a global multi-fidelity evolutionary search, where the initial population is warm-started by injecting layer-wise importance priors. This stage employs specific operators and a performance model to efficiently screen candidate configurations.

However, shared local model updates remain vulnerable to inference and poisoning attacks. Secure aggregation schemes have been proposed to mitigate these attacks. In this work, we aim to understand how these techniques are implemented in quantum-assisted FL. Quantum Secure Aggregation (QSA) has been proposed, offering information-theoretic privacy by encoding client updates into the global phase of multipartite entangled states. Existing QSA protocols, however, rely on a single global Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state shared among all participating clients. This design poses fundamental challenges: fidelity of large-scale GHZ states deteriorates rapidly with the increasing number of clients; and (ii) the global aggregation prevents the detection of Byzantine clients. We propose Clustered Quantum Secure Aggregation (CQSA), a modular aggregation framework that reconciles the physical constraints of near-term quantum hardware along with the need for Byzantine-robustness in FL. CQSA randomly partitions the clients into small clusters, each performing local quantum aggregation using high-fidelity, low-qubit GHZ states. The server analyzes statistical relationships between cluster-level aggregates employing common statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Euclidean distance to identify malicious contributions.

We re-interpret causal self-attention transformers, the backbone of modern foundation models, within a probabilistic framework, much like how classical PCA is extended to probabilistic PCA. However, this re-formulation reveals a surprising and deeper structural insight: due to a change-of-variables phenomenon, a barrier constraint emerges on the self-attention parameters. This induces a highly structured geometry on the token space, providing theoretical insights into the dynamics of LLM decoding. This reveals a boundary where attention becomes ill-conditioned, leading to a margin interpretation similar to classical support vector machines. Just like support vectors, this naturally gives rise to the concept of support tokens.\n  Furthermore, we show that LLMs can be interpreted as a stochastic process over the power set of the token space, providing a rigorous probabilistic framework for sequence modeling.

We demonstrate that this provides more robust models without sacrificing out-of-sample accuracy and that it is straightforward to incorporate in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529btransformers\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u969c\u788d\u7ea6\u675f\u4f1a\u8bf1\u5bfctoken\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afMAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u53ea\u9700\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u4e0a\u6dfb\u52a0\u5e73\u6ed1\u5bf9\u6570\u969c\u788d\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u6982\u7387\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529btransformers\uff09\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fLLM\u89e3\u7801\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u91cd\u65b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u53d8\u6362\u73b0\u8c61\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u548cMAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u6dfb\u52a0\u5e73\u6ed1\u5bf9\u6570\u969c\u788d\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u969c\u788d\u7ea6\u675f\u5bfc\u81f4token\u7a7a\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7c7b\u4f3cSVM\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u652f\u6491\u5411\u91cf\u5bf9\u5e94\u6982\u5ff5\"\u652f\u6491token\"\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u8c28\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6837\u672c\u5916\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u65e2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff08\u8fb9\u754c\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u652f\u6491token\uff09\uff0c\u53c8\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u635f\u5931\u4fee\u6539\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684LLM\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, numerical techniques used to study the laser cooling of such crystals are inefficient as the number of ions, $N$, in the crystal increases. Here we develop a powerful numerical framework to simulate laser cooling of up to $10^5$ ions stored in a Penning trap. We apply this framework to characterize and optimize the cooling of ellipsoidal 3D crystals. We document new pathways to enhanced cooling based on the addition of an axial component to the potential energy-dominated $\\boldsymbol{E}\\times\\boldsymbol{B}$ modes. Furthermore, we observe greatly enhanced cooling of the perpendicular kinetic energy to below 1 mK in prolate ion crystals, enabling a simplified cooling beam setup for such crystals.

This research predicts cardiovascular disease using a merged dataset of 1,190 patient records, comparing traditional machine learning models (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96) with open-source large language models via OpenRouter APIs. Finally, a hybrid fusion of the ML ensemble and LLM reasoning under Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the best results (96.62% accuracy, 0.97 AUC), showing that LLMs (78.9 % accuracy) work best when combined with ML models rather than used alone.

The proposed hybrid method enhanced the strength in uncertain situations, illustrating that ensemble ML is considered the best structured tabular prediction case, but it can be integrated with hybrid ML-LLM systems to provide a minor increase and open the way to more reliable clinical decision-support tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u75281,190\u6761\u60a3\u8005\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06ML\u96c6\u6210\u4e0eLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0896.62%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u662f\u5168\u7403\u9996\u8981\u6b7b\u56e0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u6280\u672f\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u5e76\u76841,190\u6761\u60a3\u8005\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\u3001LightGBM\u3001CatBoost\uff09\u4e0e\u901a\u8fc7OpenRouter API\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06ML\u96c6\u6210\u4e0eLLM\u63a8\u7406\uff08Gemini 2.5 Flash\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "ML\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0895.78%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cROC-AUC 0.96\uff09\uff1bLLM\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e2d\u7b49\uff0878.9%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7565\u597d\uff0872.6%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\uff0896.62%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c0.97 AUC\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210ML\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408ML-LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c0f\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\u5f00\u8f9f\u9053\u8def\u3002LLM\u5728\u4e0eML\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

The introduction of quantum correlations can effectively suppress this extra noise. In this work, we utilize the established quantum correlation between the Stokes field and atomic spin waves in the Raman amplification process to feedback a portion of the Stokes field into the amplifier. This leads to a reduction in quantum noise that is independent of the feedback loss at high gain. A maximum of 6 dB noise reduction is observed. The single-path feedback amplifier is found to be sensitive to the feedback phase, a property that expands its potential for applications in quantum precision measurement, and the general concept can be extended to integrated optics and fiber optic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u62c9\u66fc\u653e\u5927\u4e2d\u65af\u6258\u514b\u65af\u573a\u4e0e\u539f\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u6ce2\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u65af\u6258\u514b\u65af\u573a\u53cd\u9988\u81f3\u653e\u5927\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u53cd\u9988\u635f\u8017\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\uff08\u6700\u9ad86 dB\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u76f8\u4f4d\u654f\u611f\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cbe\u5bc6\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ca\u96c6\u6210\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u653e\u5927\u5668\u5728\u653e\u5927\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u5185\u90e8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u6765\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u79cd\u989d\u5916\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u62c9\u66fc\u653e\u5927\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65af\u6258\u514b\u65af\u573a\u4e0e\u539f\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u6ce2\u4e4b\u95f4\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u65af\u6258\u514b\u65af\u573a\u53cd\u9988\u56de\u653e\u5927\u5668\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53cd\u9988\u73af\u8def\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u589e\u76ca\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u59276 dB\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u6291\u5236\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u53cd\u9988\u635f\u8017\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u53cd\u9988\u653e\u5927\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u53cd\u9988\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u76f8\u4f4d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u5149\u7ea4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cbe\u5bc6\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u65e0\u5c0f\u533aO-RAN\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u3001\u7528\u6237\u52a0\u6743\u3001O-RU\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u56db\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u91c7\u7528PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8282\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1141.93%\u7684\u6d3b\u8dc3O-RU\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e92%\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6b63\u6210\u4e3a\u81ea\u6cbb\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f7f\u80fd\u6280\u672f\uff0cO-RAN\u67b6\u6784\u652f\u6301\u6b64\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u7136\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u72ec\u7acb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5904\u7406\u7b80\u5355\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\u9700\u8981\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u534f\u540c\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u5c0f\u533aO-RAN\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u76d1\u7763\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c06\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u901f\u7387\u8981\u6c42\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u52a0\u6743\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ece\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u68c0\u7d22\u7ecf\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u7528\u6237\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u82e5\u6d89\u53ca\u8282\u80fd\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5219\u6fc0\u6d3bO-RU\u7ba1\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528DRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u6d3b\u8dc3O-RU\u96c6\u5408\uff1b\u76d1\u63a7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e76\u534f\u8c03\u4fdd\u8bc1\u901f\u7387\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u4e00\u5e95\u5c42\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f9b\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8282\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1141.93%\u7684\u6d3b\u8dc3O-RU\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u90e8\u7f72\u72ec\u7acb\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1192%\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406O-RAN\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u5b9e\u73b0\u610f\u56fe\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8282\u80fd\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Materials and Methods: We constructed a dataset from ClinicalTrials.gov comprising 42,112 CTs. Structured, semi-structured trial data, and unstructured protocol-related free-text data were extracted. CTs were assigned binary labels indicating elevated dosing error rate, derived from adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. We evaluated an XGBoost model trained on structured features, a ClinicalModernBERT model using textual data, and a simple late-fusion model combining both modalities. Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures. Conclusion: This study introduces a reproducible and scalable ML framework for early, trial-level risk stratification of CTs at risk of high dosing error rates, supporting proactive, risk-based quality management in clinical research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u542f\u52a8\u524d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed9\u836f\u9519\u8bef\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e42,112\u9879\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6587\u672c\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578bAUC\u8fbe0.862\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u591a\u4e3a\u4e8b\u540e\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5728\u8bd5\u9a8c\u542f\u52a8\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed9\u836f\u9519\u8bef\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bd5\u9a8c\u3002\u7ed9\u836f\u9519\u8bef\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4eceClinicalTrials.gov\u6784\u5efa42,112\u9879\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u3001\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u548c\u534f\u8bae\u6587\u672c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u826f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62a5\u544a\u3001MedDRA\u672f\u8bed\u548cWilson\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ed9\u836f\u9519\u8bef\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4XGBoost\uff08\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u3001ClinicalModernBERT\uff08\u6587\u672c\uff09\u548c\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u6982\u7387\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08AUC-ROC=0.862\uff09\u3002\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5212\u5206\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u7ea7\uff0c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7ec4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9645\u9ad8\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u968f\u9884\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\u5355\u8c03\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684ML\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bd5\u9a8c\u524d\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed9\u836f\u9519\u8bef\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u5373\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6982\u7387\u6821\u51c6\u4f7f\u8f93\u51fa\u5177\u5907\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e3b\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002"}}

By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks. Our results demonstrate that decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCourtGuard\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u50f5\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57287\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5ba1\u6838\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5206\u985e\u5668\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u50f5\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u65b0\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCourtGuard\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u60f3\u4e3a\"\u8bc1\u636e\u8fa9\u8bba\"\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u7834\u574f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523090%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u7528\u4e8e9\u4e2a\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6574\u7406\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u672a\u6765AI\u6cbb\u7406\u76d1\u7ba1\u8981\u6c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings. This perspective highlights a path toward more robust, interpretable, and construct-aligned practices for AI development and evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165AI\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9879\u76ee\u53cd\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5982\u591a\u5c42\u9762Rasch\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u6821\u6b63\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u5982\u4e25\u5389\u5ea6\u548c\u8d8b\u4e2d\u6548\u5e94\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347AI\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728AI\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u88ab\u5f53\u4f5c\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6765\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u5c42\u9762Rasch\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5230AI\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u6b63\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u4e25\u5389\u5ea6\u7b49\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u771f\u5b9e\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u4ee5OpenAI\u6458\u8981\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u6821\u6b63\u540e\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u878d\u5165\u4eba\u5728\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u52a8AI\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5411\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u6784\u5ff5\u6548\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a framework for systematically mapping the Manifold of Failure in Large Language Models (LLMs). We reframe the search for vulnerabilities as a quality diversity problem, using MAP-Elites to illuminate the continuous topology of these failure regions, which we term behavioral attraction basins. Our quality metric, Alignment Deviation, guides the search towards areas where the model's behavior diverges most from its intended alignment. Across three LLMs: Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, and GPT-5-Mini, we show that MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B exhibits a near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows a fragmented landscape with spatially concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with a ceiling at 0.50.

Quantum optical experiments offer a non-invasive approach which links up macroscopic measurements with the quantity of quantum emitters. In this work, we propose a time-domain quantum optical methodology for the strict numbering of colloidal CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) confined in subwavelength-size polystyrene capsules. The non-polarized, homogeneously broadened emission of colloidal QDs in the subwavelength volume satisfies the description of Dicke's superradiance of identical quantum emitters. An analytic relation describes the numerical dependence of the second-order photon correlation on the number and the collective lifetime of emitters, yielding an experimental counting range of colloidal QDs from one to ten.

In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context.

GRC is capable of operating in a \"ColdStart\" mode, generating predictions without relying on historical river states for initialization. In 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts, GRC-ColdStart functions as a robust standalone simulator, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of approximately 0.82 without exhibiting the significant error accumulation typical of autoregressive paradigms. Ablation studies reveal that topological encoding serves as indispensable structural information in the absence of historical states, explicitly guiding hydraulic connectivity and network-scale mass redistribution to reconstruct flow dynamics. Furthermore, when adapted locally via a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, GRC consistently outperforms physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines. Crucially, this superiority extends from gauged reaches to full river networks, underscoring the necessity of topology encoding and physics-based pre-training.

An Energy-Based Theory and Regularizer for Concept Drift in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Signals", "comment": null, "summary": "Models operating on dynamic physiologic signals must distinguish benign, label-preserving variability from true concept change. Existing concept-drift frameworks are largely distributional and provide no principled guidance on how much a model's internal representation may move when the underlying signal undergoes physiologically plausible fluctuations in energy. As a result, deep models often misinterpret harmless changes in amplitude, rate, or morphology as concept drift, yielding unstable predictions, particularly in multimodal fusion settings.\n  This study introduces Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT), an energy-based framework for concept stability in dynamic signals. PECT posits that under virtual drift, normalized latent displacement should scale proportionally with normalized signal energy change, while persistent violations of this proportionality indicate real concept drift. We operationalize this principle through Energy-Constrained Representation Learning (ECRL), a lightweight regularizer that penalizes energy-inconsistent latent movement without modifying encoder architectures or adding inference-time cost.\n  Although PECT is formulated for dynamic signals in general, we instantiate and evaluate it on multimodal ECG across seven unimodal and hybrid models. Experiments show that in the strongest trimodal hybrid (1D+2D+Transformer), clean accuracy is largely preserved (96.0% to 94.1%), while perturbed accuracy improves substantially (72.6% to 85.5%) and fused representation drift decreases by over 45%.

This complexity is further compounded in multi-channel scenarios, where effective allocation of budgets and constraints across channels with distinct behavioral patterns becomes critical for optimizing return on investment. Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale offline datasets and through online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of AHBid, yielding a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "AHBid is a hierarchical auto-bidding framework that combines diffusion-based generative planning with real-time control for multi-channel advertising, improving ROI by 13.57%.", "motivation": "Multi-channel online advertising requires dynamic budget allocation and bid optimization, but current methods lack flexibility (optimization-based) or struggle with historical dependencies (reinforcement learning).", "method": "Proposes a hierarchical framework with: 1) high-level diffusion-based generative planner for budget/constraint allocation using historical context, 2) constraint enforcement mechanism, 3) trajectory refinement using historical data, and 4) low-level control-based bidding algorithm combining historical and real-time information.", "result": "Achieves 13.57% higher overall return compared to baselines, validated on large-scale offline datasets and online A/B tests.", "conclusion": "The integrated generative planning and real-time control approach effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, demonstrating significant improvements in adaptability and operational efficacy for auto-bidding systems."}}

Here, we adopt the minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm, a subroutine invaluable to decoding topological codes, to decode bivariate bicycle codes. Using the equivalence of bivariate bicycle codes to copies of the toric code, we propose a method we call the 'cylinder trick' to rapidly find a correction using matching on code symmetries. We benchmark our decoder on the gross code family, cyclic hypergraph-product codes, generalized toric codes, and recently proposed directional codes, demonstrating the general applicability of our protocol.

However, most existing RL-based MFD approaches do not fully exploit RL's sequential decision-making strengths, often treating MFD as a simple guessing game (Contextual Bandits). To bridge this gap, we formulate MFD as an offline inverse reinforcement learning problem, where the agent learns the reward dynamics directly from healthy operational sequences, thereby bypassing the need for manual reward engineering and fault labels. Our framework employs Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to train a discriminator that distinguishes between normal (expert) and policy-generated transitions. The discriminator's learned reward serves as an anomaly score, indicating deviations from normal operating behaviour. When evaluated on three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), the model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, enabling early and robust fault detection.

Alignment training aims to prevent such behavior by reinforcing the correct goals, but alignment may not always succeed and can lead to unwanted side effects. We propose self-incrimination training, which instead trains agents to produce a visible signal when they covertly misbehave. We train GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.0 agents to call a report_scheming() tool when behaving deceptively and measure their ability to cause harm undetected in out-of-distribution environments. Self-incrimination significantly reduces the undetected successful attack rate, outperforming matched-capability monitors and alignment baselines while preserving instruction hierarchy and incurring minimal safety tax on general capabilities. Unlike blackbox monitoring, self-incrimination performance is consistent across tasks regardless of how suspicious the misbehavior appears externally.

It is commonly viewed as inducing an intrinsic hierarchy among incompatible observables: some sets of quantum properties are fundamentally more incompatible than others, as quantified by the maximal sharpness permitting their joint measurement. We show that this hierarchy ceases to be absolute in the multi-copy regime. Analyzing qubit spin observables, we prove a No-Comparison Theorem establishing that no global ordering of incompatible observable sets is preserved across all finite-copy configurations. In particular, two sets of observables can exhibit reversed complementarity ordering depending solely on whether the available resources are arranged as identical copies or as parallel-antiparallel pairs. Thus, the degree of quantum incompatibility is not an intrinsic property of observables alone but depends on the global configuration of the prepared quantum probes. Our results uncover a configuration-dependent structure of complementarity, reveal a subtle role of entanglement in shaping the structure of measurement limitations, and call for a reassessment of quantum information protocols under finite resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5c42\u7ea7\u5e76\u975e\u7edd\u5bf9\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4e0d\u76f8\u5bb9\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u914d\u7f6e\u800c\u975e\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u526f\u672c\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0b\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u6240\u6709\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5373\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u4e0d\u76f8\u5bb9\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u67d0\u4e9b\u91cf\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u96c6\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u66f4\u4e0d\u76f8\u5bb9\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c42\u7ea7\u5728\u591a\u526f\u672c regime \u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u4f9d\u7136\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u81ea\u65cb\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b9a\u7406\uff08No-Comparison Theorem\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u526f\u672c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u591a\u526f\u672c regime \u4e0b\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u96c6\u7684\u4e0d\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\u53ef\u56e0\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u76f8\u540c\u526f\u672c vs \u5e73\u884c-\u53cd\u5e73\u884c\u5bf9\uff09\u800c\u5b8c\u5168\u53cd\u8f6c\uff1b\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u6709\u9650\u526f\u672c\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0d\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5185\u7980\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7531\u91cf\u5b50\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u914d\u7f6e\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u6784\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c entanglement \u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

To address common challenges like data sparsity and cold start, recent researchs have leveraged data from multiple auxiliary domains to enrich information within the target domain. However, inherent domain gaps can degrade the quality of mixed-domain data, leading to negative transfer and diminished model performance. Existing prevailing \\emph{model-centric} paradigm -- which relies on complex, customized architectures -- struggles to capture the subtle, non-structural sequence dependencies across domains, leading to poor generalization and high demands on computational resources. To address these shortcomings, we propose \\textsc{Taesar}, a \\emph{data-centric} framework for \\textbf{t}arget-\\textbf{a}lign\\textbf{e}d \\textbf{s}equenti\\textbf{a}l \\textbf{r}egeneration, which employs a contrastive decoding mechanism to adaptively encode cross-domain context into target-domain sequences. It employs contrastive decoding to encode cross-domain context into target sequences, enabling standard models to learn intricate dependencies without complex fusion architectures. Experiments show \\textsc{Taesar} outperforms model-centric solutions and generalizes to various sequential models.

By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers and inputs, this work shows that spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior, capable of separating structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. Within this framework, the first contribution, EigenTrack, introduces a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in large language and vision-language models. EigenTrack transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors such as entropy, variance, and deviations from the Marchenko-Pastur baseline, and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers, enabling early detection of reliability failures before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics. The second contribution, RMT-KD, presents a principled approach to compressing deep networks via random matrix theoretic knowledge distillation. By interpreting outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as carriers of task-relevant information, RMT-KD progressively projects networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces through iterative self-distillation, yielding significantly more compact and energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and dense, hardware-friendly structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "This thesis develops a unified spectral geometry and random matrix theory framework to tackle deep learning reliability and efficiency by analyzing eigenvalue dynamics, proposing EigenTrack for hallucination detection and RMT-KD for model compression.", "motivation": "Scaling deep networks and LLMs become increasingly opaque with hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and unsustainable computational/energy demands, requiring interpretable monitoring of internal representations.", "method": "Analyzes eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers using spectral statistics (entropy, variance, Marchenko-Pastur deviations) to separate causal representations from noise via spectral geometry and random matrix theory.", "result": "Two key contributions: (1) EigenTrack enables real-time hallucination/OOD detection in LLMs using lightweight recurrent classifiers on streaming spectral descriptors; (2) RMT-KD achieves principled model compression via iterative self-distillation, projecting networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces while preserving accuracy.", "conclusion": "Spectral analysis provides a compact, stable, and interpretable lens for model behavior, enabling early detection of reliability failures before output generation and yielding significantly more compact, energy-efficient models with hardware-friendly dense structures."}}

Significant challenges arise in the metrologically relevant case where the effective interaction between the particles is weak and the particle to be cooled exhibits significant initial motional energy. Here we specifically address the most generally applicable case where the laser-cooled ion and the particle of interest are confined to two spatially separate potential wells with equal motional frequency for resonant enhancement of the cooling dynamics. We analyze the latter through numerical simulations and find that anharmonicities of the potential wells can prevent maintaining the resonance condition throughout the cooling process and thus inhibit a significant reduction in motional energy. We propose a cooling scheme that sweeps the trapping frequency of the potential wells. We show that this scheme enables efficient cooling from cryogenic temperatures all the way to the quantum regime of motion. As a specific application scenario, we analyze the sympathetic cooling of (anti-)protons into the quantum regime of motion for quantum-logic-spectroscopy-based tests of CPT invariance at the quantum limit in Penning traps. Nevertheless, our results and cooling strategies are generally applicable to other laser-inaccessible ion species.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u626b\u9891\u65b9\u6848\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u8c10\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u5931\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u4f4e\u6e29\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u51b7\u5374", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u96be\u4ee5\u51b7\u5374\u81f3\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u652f\u6491CPT\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7cbe\u5bc6\u68c0\u9a8c", "method": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u53cc\u52bf\u9631\u7cfb\u7edf\u975e\u8c10\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52bf\u9631\u6355\u83b7\u9891\u7387\u626b\u9891\u51b7\u5374\u65b9\u6848", "result": "\u626b\u9891\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u5171\u632f\u5931\u8c10\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u4f4e\u6e29\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8 regime \u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u51b7\u5374", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53cd\u8d28\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u903b\u8f91\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u6fc0\u5149\u4e0d\u53ef\u51b7\u5374\u79bb\u5b50\u7269\u79cd"}}

The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance.

However, despite their flexibility and wide applicability, their performance is fundamentally limited by Barren Plateaus (BP), where gradients vanish and optimization becomes intractable. Noise-Induced Barren Plateaus (NIBP) are particularly interesting, as they are predicted to arise due to noise accumulation independent of circuit structure. We experimentally study NIBP on IBM quantum hardware and demonstrate their absence under non-unital amplitude damping characterized by the qubit's $T_1$ coherence times. We use Information Content Landscape Analysis (ICLA) to efficiently estimate gradient norms for circuits ranging from 8 to 102 qubits, with hundreds of parameters and circuit runtimes of hundreds of microseconds. Classical simulations of the 8-qubit case under noiseless, depolarizing, amplitude damping, and dephasing noise models serve as a baseline comparison. We thoroughly analyze the experimental results considering calibration data, shot-noise, and circuit structure. We robustly observe that the gradient magnitude saturates beyond a characteristic circuit runtime, in contrast with the exponential decay expected from NIBP. Using recent theoretical results, we corroborate that under $T_1$-dominated noise NIBP do not occur and extract an effective $T_1^\\text{eff}$ that is significantly shorter than suggested by standard calibration data. Our results experimentally confirm recent predictions on the absence of NIBP under non-unital noise. These findings also indicate that conventional benchmarking metrics based on average values for device characteristics may be insufficient to predict variational algorithm performance, but full distributions need to be considered.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728IBM\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728T1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8d2b\u7620\u9ad8\u539f\uff08NIBP\uff09\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5e76\u4e0d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u4f1a\u9971\u548c\u800c\u975e\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u6240\u663e\u793a\u7684\u66f4\u77ed\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u8fd1\u671f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u5230\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8d2b\u7620\u9ad8\u539f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u566a\u58f0\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8d2b\u7620\u9ad8\u539f\uff08NIBP\uff09\u7279\u522b\u503c\u5f97\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u88ab\u9884\u6d4b\u4f1a\u56e0\u566a\u58f0\u7d2f\u79ef\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u7535\u8def\u7ed3\u6784\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u8fd1-term\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u542b\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\u5206\u6790\uff08ICLA\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba18-102\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7535\u8def\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u3002\u5728IBM\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf98\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u60c5\u51b5\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u9000\u6781\u5316\u3001\u632f\u5e45\u963b\u5c3c\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u963b\u5c3c\uff09\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7535\u8def\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7a33\u5065\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u68af\u5ea6\u5e45\u5ea6\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7535\u8def\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u540e\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u4e0eNIBP\u9884\u671f\u7684\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u5728T1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff0cNIBP\u4e0d\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u3002\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6709\u6548T1^eff\u663e\u8457\u77ed\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u6240\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u566a\u58f0\u4e0bNIBP\u4e0d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u7279\u6027\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4fa7\u91cd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u800c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d41\uff09\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51faAMA-Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548cAMA-Agent\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4ee557.22%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf11.16%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4ee5\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7531\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u6784\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efaAMA-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\uff08\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8QA\uff09\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\uff08\u89c4\u5219\u6807\u6ce8QA\uff09\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faAMA-Agent\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u8bb0\u5f55\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7f3a\u5931\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "AMA-Agent\u5728AMA-Bench\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523057.22%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534711.16\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\uff0cAMA-Agent\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7684AMA-Bench\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Yang", "Yue Li"], "title": "Disentangling Shared and Target-Enriched Topics via Background-Contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization", "comment": null, "summary": "Biological signals of interest in high-dimensional data are often masked by dominant variation shared across conditions. This variation, arising from baseline biological structure or technical effects, can prevent standard dimensionality reduction methods from resolving condition-specific structure. The challenge is that these confounding topics are often unknown and mixed with biological signals. Existing background correction methods are either unscalable to high dimensions or not interpretable. We introduce background contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (\\model), which extracts target-enriched latent topics by jointly factorizing a target dataset and a matched background using shared non-negative bases under a contrastive objective that suppresses background-expressed structure. This approach yields non-negative components that are directly interpretable at the feature level, and explicitly isolates target-specific variation. \\model is learned by an efficient multiplicative update algorithm via matrix multiplication such that it is highly efficient on GPU hardware and scalable to big data via minibatch training akin to deep learning approach. Across simulations and diverse biological datasets, \\model reveals signals obscured by conventional methods, including disease-associated programs in postmortem depressive brain single-cell RNA-seq, genotype-linked protein expression patterns in mice, treatment-specific transcriptional changes in leukemia, and TP53-dependent drug responses in cancer cell lines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08bcNMF\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5206\u89e3\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u975e\u8d1f\u57fa\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u53d8\u5f02\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301GPU\u52a0\u901f\u548cminibatch\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e38\u88ab\u8de8\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u53d8\u5f02\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u6280\u672f\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u63a9\u76d6\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u6790\u6761\u4ef6\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u80cc\u666f\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53c8\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\uff08bcNMF\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u89e3\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5339\u914d\u80cc\u666f\u6570\u636e\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u975e\u8d1f\u57fa\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u6570\u77e9\u9635\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53d8\u5f02\uff1b4\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u7684\u4e58\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301GPU\u5e76\u884c\u548cminibatch\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u975e\u8d1f\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u9762\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u751f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86bcNMF\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1a1\uff09\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u6b7b\u540e\u5927\u8111\u5355\u7ec6\u80deRNA-seq\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u75be\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1b2\uff09\u5c0f\u9f20\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u56e0\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b3\uff09\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63ed\u793a\u6cbb\u7597\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8f6c\u5f55\u53d8\u5316\uff1b4\uff09\u764c\u75c7\u7ec6\u80de\u7cfb\u4e2d\u89e3\u6790\u51faTP53\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u836f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5747\u88ab\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u63a9\u76d6\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "bcNMF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u80cc\u666f\u53d8\u5f02\u63a9\u76d6\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7ec4\u5b66\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u51c6\u89e3\u6790\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

The spin-cat qubit, encoded in a large nuclear spin-$F$ system, is a promising candidate for bias-tailored QECCs.

Clinical experts must identify whether available information is sufficient for judgment, as both premature conclusion and unnecessary abstention can compromise patient safety. To evaluate this capability of large language models (LLMs), we developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. Identifying determinability requires considering all hypotheses about missing information, including unlikely ones, and verifying whether the conclusion holds across them. We find that recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention, despite correctly explaining the underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate the safety of LLMs in clinical settings.

This study proposes an interpretable machine learning framework to predict MDR in bacterial isolates using clinical features and antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Five classification models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The models were trained on a curated dataset of 9,714 isolates, with resistance encoded at the antibiotic family level to capture cross-class resistance patterns consistent with MDR definitions. Performance assessment included accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Ensemble models, particularly XGBoost and LightGBM, demonstrated superior predictive capability across all metrics. To address the clinical transparency gap, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) was applied to generate instance-level explanations.

In standard thermodynamic protocols involving system--bath interactions, the maximum work is given by the free-energy difference between the initial state and the corresponding Gibbs state at the bath temperature. This motivates a natural question: does information also limit work extraction in closed quantum systems that do not involve a heat bath and where work is obtained through unitary operations generated by a time-dependent Hamiltonian? While ergotropy quantifies the maximum work extractable via unitary operations, it assumes complete knowledge of the quantum state, typically requiring full state tomography. In realistic scenarios, however, only partial information is accessible. In this case, the relevant figure of merit is observational ergotropy, which depends explicitly on the measurement used to probe the system. We show that observational ergotropy decreases under classical post-processing of measurement outcomes, implying that fine-grained measurements allow greater work extraction than coarse-grained ones. Moreover, maximizing observational ergotropy over all possible measurements recovers standard ergotropy, which decomposes into incoherent (classical) and coherent (quantum) contributions. Our results demonstrate that coherence in the measurement projectors constitutes the key resource, enabling work extraction beyond the incoherent limit and establishing coherence as the origin of quantum advantage in observational ergotropy extraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u65cb\u8f6c\u80fd\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4ec5\u638c\u63e1\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5c01\u95ed\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u529f\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6d4b\u91cf\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8e\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u529f\u63d0\u53d6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\"\u65cb\u8f6c\u80fd\"\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u5168\u5df2\u77e5\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\u529f\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u5c01\u95ed\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea6\u675f\u5bf9\u529f\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\"\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u65cb\u8f6c\u80fd\"\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4e0b\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8be5\u91cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u7269\u7406\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "result": "1) \u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u65cb\u8f6c\u80fd\u968f\u7ecf\u5178\u540e\u5904\u7406\u800c\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u529f\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b2) \u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u91cf\u53d6\u6700\u5927\u503c\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6807\u51c6\u65cb\u8f6c\u80fd\uff1b3) \u65cb\u8f6c\u80fd\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u9879\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u9879\uff1b4) \u6d4b\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u662f\u7a81\u7834\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u6781\u9650\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u5178\u6781\u9650\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u529f\u63d0\u53d6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}

We present MolFM-Lite, a multi-modal model that jointly encodes SELFIES sequences (1D), molecular graphs (2D), and conformer ensembles (3D) through cross-attention fusion, while conditioning predictions on experimental context via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). Our main methodological contributions are: (1) a conformer ensemble attention mechanism that combines learnable attention with Boltzmann-weighted priors over multiple RDKit-generated conformers, capturing the thermodynamic distribution of molecular shapes; and (2) a cross-modal fusion layer where each modality can attend to others, enabling complementary information sharing. We evaluate on four MoleculeNet scaffold-split benchmarks using our model's own splits, and report all baselines re-evaluated under the same protocol.

In this service-oriented paradigm, quantum circuits, which constitute high-value intellectual property, are exposed to risks of unauthorized access, reuse, and misuse. Digital watermarking has been explored as a promising mechanism for protecting quantum circuits by embedding ownership information for tracing and verification. However, driven by recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, the paradigm of quantum circuit design is shifting from individually and manually constructed circuits to automated synthesis based on quantum circuit generative models (QCGMs). In such generative settings, protecting only individual output circuits is insufficient, and existing post hoc, circuit-centric watermarking methods are not designed to integrate with the generative process, often failing to simultaneously ensure stealthiness, functional correctness, and robustness at scale. These limitations highlight the need for a new watermarking paradigm that is natively integrated with quantum circuit generative models. In this work, we present the first watermarking framework for QCGMs, which embeds ownership signals into the generation process while preserving circuit fidelity. We introduce a symmetric sampling strategy that aligns watermark encoding with the model's Gaussian prior, and a synchronization mechanism that counteracts adversarial watermark attack through latent drift correction. Empirical results confirm that our method achieves high-fidelity circuit generation and robust watermark detection across a range of perturbations, paving the way for scalable, secure copyright protection in AI-powered quantum design.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes the first watermarking framework for quantum circuit generative models (QCGMs) that embeds ownership signals directly into the generation process.

Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), relying on fixed teacher traces or teacher-student Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization. When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation. Across diverse logic reasoning and math benchmarks, RLAD consistently outperforms offline distillation, standard GRPO, and KL-based on-policy teacher-student knowledge distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRL-aware\u84b8\u998f(RLAD)\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3Trust Region Ratio\u84b8\u998f(TRRD)\u7528PPO/GRPO\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u66ff\u4ee3KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u57df\u6709\u754c\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u9488\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e0eRL\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff08\u6559\u5e08\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5316\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff09\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5e72\u6270\uff08KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\u4e14\u9700\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5e73\u8861\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRLAD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728RL\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3TRRD\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ee5\u6559\u5e08-\u65e7\u7b56\u7565\u6df7\u5408\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u7528PPO/GRPO\u5f0f\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u66ff\u4ee3KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u57df\u6709\u754c\u7684\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u5229\u7528\u4e0e\u6a21\u4eff\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRLAD\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u6807\u51c6GRPO\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eKL\u7684on-policy\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RLAD\u901a\u8fc7TRRD\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RL\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c06\u5927\u578bRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This review presents a unified perspective on these developments based on sheaf-theoretic and graph-theoretic frameworks, which provide theory-independent characterizations of statistical correlations. These approaches clarify the structural relationship between contextuality and nonlocality, facilitate the formulation of experimentally testable inequalities, and guide implementations in realistic physical platforms, with particular emphasis on photonic systems.

Here we present SPM-Bench, an original, PhD-level multimodal benchmark specifically designed for scanning probe microscopy (SPM). We propose a fully automated data synthesis pipeline that ensures both high authority and low-cost. By employing Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS) technology, we efficiently extract high-value image-text pairs from arXiv and journal papers published between 2023 and 2025. Through a hybrid cloud-local architecture where VLMs return only spatial coordinates \"llbox\" for local high-fidelity cropping, our pipeline achieves extreme token savings while maintaining high dataset purity. To accurately and objectively evaluate the performance of the LLMs, we introduce the Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1) score.

The oracle converts RPLAN-style layouts into rectangle-space graphs through greedy maximal-rectangle decomposition and door-mediated adjacency construction, and then computes integration-based measurements to quantify public space dominance and functional hierarchy.\n  To enable consistent evaluation and diagnosis, we further introduce SSPT-Bench (Eval-8), an out-of-distribution benchmark that post-trains models using conditions capped at $\\leq 7$ rooms while evaluating on 8-room programs, together with a unified metric suite for dominance, stability, and profile alignment. SSPT is instantiated with two strategies: (i) iterative retraining via space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, and (ii) reinforcement learning via PPO with space-syntax rewards. Experiments show that both strategies improve public-space dominance and restore clearer functional hierarchy compared to distribution-fitted baselines, while PPO achieves stronger gains with substantially higher compute efficiency and reduced variance.

Despite their success, modern deep forecasting models are typically trained to minimize point-wise prediction loss without leveraging the rich information contained in past prediction residuals from rolling forecasts - residuals that reflect persistent biases, unmodeled patterns, or evolving dynamics. We propose TEFL (Temporal Error Feedback Learning), a unified learning framework that explicitly incorporates these historical residuals into the forecasting pipeline during both training and evaluation. To make this practical in deep multi-step settings, we address three key challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under the partial observability of rolling forecasts, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter to preserve efficiency and prevent overfitting, and (3) designing a two-stage training procedure that jointly optimizes the base forecaster and error module. Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show that TEFL consistently improves accuracy, reducing MAE by 5-10% on average. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness under abrupt changes and distribution shifts, with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios.

Their performance is commonly quantified by three metrics: pair-collection probability, heralding efficiency, and spectral purity. In bulk-crystal SPDC, these metrics are known to be mutually constrained, yet the physical origin of the resulting trade-offs is often obscured. We show that these trade-offs originate from the frequency-dependent population of discrete spatial modes in the SPDC emission. By performing a Laguerre-Gauss mode decomposition at each frequency component, we show how spectral-spatial non-separability impacts collection probability, heralding efficiency, and purity. We apply this framework to two widely used quasi-phase-matching configurations: collinear degenerate type-0 and type-II SPDC in periodically poled bulk crystals, and quantify how different phase-matching functions shape the spectral-spatial mode structure. In particular, for type-II SPDC we compare standard periodically poled and aperiodically poled Gaussian phase matching. We experimentally validate some of our theoretical results using spatial- and spectral-projection measurements. This spectral-spatial mode analysis provides a quantitative and predictive framework for understanding and engineering bulk-crystal photon sources, enabling systematic multi-parameter optimization beyond qualitative design guidelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f53\u6676\u4f53\u81ea\u53d1\u53c2\u91cf\u4e0b\u8f6c\u6362(SPDC)\u5149\u5b50\u6e90\u4e2d\u4e09\u5927\u91cf\u5b50\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807(\u5bf9\u6536\u96c6\u6982\u7387\u3001\u9884\u793a\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u7eaf\u5ea6)\u7684\u6743\u8861\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u62c9\u76d6\u5c14-\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u9891\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f53\u6676\u4f53SPDC\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u5236\u7ea6\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7269\u7406\u8d77\u6e90\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u62c9\u76d6\u5c14-\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5bf9SPDC\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9891\u7387\u5206\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u9891\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u4f4d\u5339\u914d\u51fd\u6570\u5efa\u6a21(\u5305\u62ec\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6781\u5316\u548c\u975e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u76f8\u4f4d\u5339\u914d)", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9891\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u975e\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728type-0/type-II\u76f8\u4f4d\u5339\u914d\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4f4d\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5f8b", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u9891\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0SPDC\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9a\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u5668\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

Among recent advances in deep learning for EEG, geometric learning stands out as its theoretical underpinnings on symmetric positive definite (SPD) allows revealing structural connectivity analysis in a physics-grounded manner. However, current SPD-based methods focus predominantly on statistical aggregation of EEGs, with frequency-specific synchronization and local topological structures of brain regions neglected. Given this, we propose RepSPD, a novel geometric deep learning (GDL)-based model. RepSPD implements a cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate the geometric attributes of SPD with graph-derived functional connectivity features. On top of this, we introduce a global bidirectional alignment strategy to reshape tangent-space embeddings, mitigating geometric distortions caused by curvature and thereby enhancing geometric consistency.

Drawing a direct analogy between classical wave optics and quantum state evolution in a bosonic mode, we construct a confocal system with two Fock-space lenses. The first lens deterministically focuses a coherent state into a quantum probe with a tightly concentrated photon-number distribution, while the second lens maps the metrological information back to the vacuum state for efficient readout. Using a superconducting circuit QED platform, we prepare focused probe states with mean photon numbers up to ${N} = 500$, achieving a 21.5$\\pm$1.1 dB compression of the photon-number uncertainty relative to a coherent state, with a scalable quantum circuit of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ operational depth. We demonstrate a displacement sensitivity scaling as $N^{-0.416}$, approaching the Heisenberg scaling ($N^{-0.5}$), and achieve a record metrological gain of 19.06$\\pm$0.13 dB beyond the standard quantum limit.

Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks.

A two-sided master equation yields the fidelity and quantum Fisher information (QFI) of environment states, thereby setting fundamental limits for hypothesis testing and parameter estimation under continuous monitoring. For unmonitored noise or inefficient detection, the QFI of the detectable part of the environment may be obtained from a recently derived GME acting on multiple system replicas. Tilted master equations provide the full counting statistics of quantum jumps and diffusive measurements, enabling, e.g., studies of quantum thermodynamics beyond average values. Here we focus on bosonic linear systems, governed by a quadratic Hamiltonian and linear jump operators, whose dynamics preserves Gaussianity. For Gaussian initial states, we recast a generic GME as a compact set of ordinary differential equations for the covariance matrix (a Riccati-type equation), first moments, and normalization. These equations can be integrated efficiently without Hilbert-space truncation, and admit analytical results in simple settings. We also provide specialized forms for fidelity/QFI and full counting statistics.

However, existing NMF-based methods are inherently single-scale and fail to capture the evolution of connectivity structures across resolutions. In this work, we propose persistent nonnegative matrix factorization (pNMF), a scale-parameterized family of NMF problems, that produces a sequence of persistence-aligned embeddings rather than a single one. By leveraging persistent homology, we identify a canonical minimal sufficient scale set at which the underlying connectivity undergoes qualitative changes. These canonical scales induce a sequence of graph Laplacians, leading to a coupled NMF formulation with scale-wise geometric regularization and explicit cross-scale consistency constraint. We analyze the structural properties of the embeddings along the scale parameter and establish bounds on their increments between consecutive scales.

We investigate whether this gap can be closed by integrating an instruction-tuned model (ITM) into an LRM. Analyzing their differences in parameter space, namely task vectors, we find that their principal subspaces are nearly orthogonal across key modules, suggesting a lightweight merging with minimal interference. However, we also demonstrate that naive merges are fragile because they overlook the output format mismatch between LRMs (with explicit thinking and response segments) and ITMs (answers-only). We introduce RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging), a gradient-free method that integrates instruction following while preserving thinking format and reasoning performance. First, with a small reasoning calibration set, we project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens, which preserves the LRM's structured reasoning mechanisms.

We propose a single-shot echo-based protocol for estimating small rotations about an unknown axis that leverages random symmetric probe states prepared via chaotic dynamics. In contrast to previous protocols for this axis-agnostic rotation sensing problem that depend on difficult-to-prepare anticoherent states, the random probe states used in our protocol can be prepared via constant-depth chaotic circuits composed of random one-axis twisting pulses. We demonstrate analytically that our protocol achieves Heisenberg scaling relative to an arbitrary rotation axis that need not be a priori known. We also investigate the effects of collective and single-particle dephasing in our protocol using analytical and numerical tools.

Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable.

Relational Deep Learning (RDL) methods automate feature engineering via message passing, while classical approaches like Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) rely on predefined non-parametric aggregators. Despite performance gains, the comparative advantages of RDL over DFS and the design principles for selecting effective architectures remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that unifies RDL and DFS in a shared design space and conducts architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks.

This search yields a model performance bank that links architecture configurations to their performance; leveraging this bank, we analyze the drivers of the RDL-DFS performance gap and introduce two task signals -- RDB task homophily and an affinity embedding that captures size, path, feature, and temporal structure -- whose correlation with the gap enables principled routing. Guided by these signals, we propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that chooses between RDL and DFS and prunes the within-family search. Lightweight loss-landscape metrics further guard against brittle checkpoints by preferring flatter optima.

We derive a closed-form solution to optimally map the harmful representations of LRLs to the robust safety subspaces of HRLs, while preserving general utility via a null-space projection constraint.

Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our work establishes a principled pathway toward general world models, clarifying both the limitations of current systems and the architectural requirements for future progress.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e09\u4f4d\u4e00\u4f53\"\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5177\u5907\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u51faCoW-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1Sora\u7b49\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9a\u4e49\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5fc5\u5907\u7279\u6027\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e09\u4f4d\u4e00\u4f53\"\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6f14\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1CoW-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u901a\u5411\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u8fdb\u5c55\u6240\u9700\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e09\u4f4d\u4e00\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u548cCoW-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ba2\u89c2\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u4ece\u677e\u6563\u8026\u5408\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5411\u7edf\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u6f14\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, current approaches face significant challenges in bridging the modality gap between EEG and image data. These methods typically rely on complex adaptation processes involving multiple stages, making it hard to maintain consistency and manage compounding errors. Furthermore, the computational overhead imposed by large-scale diffusion models limit their practicality in real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this work, we present AVDE, a lightweight and efficient framework for visual decoding from EEG signals. First, we leverage LaBraM, a pre-trained EEG model, and fine-tune it via contrastive learning to align EEG and image representations. Second, we adopt an autoregressive generative framework based on a \"next-scale prediction\" strategy: images are encoded into multi-scale token maps using a pre-trained VQ-VAE, and a transformer is trained to autoregressively predict finer-scale tokens starting from EEG embeddings as the coarsest representation. This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images. Experiments on two datasets show that AVDE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, while using only 10% of the parameters. In addition, visualization of intermediate outputs shows that the generative process of AVDE reflects the hierarchical nature of human visual perception.

We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment.

Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.\n  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling.

We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics.

However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields (e.g., reviews or clinical notes) alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs).

Under journal review", "summary": "AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts -- medical diagnosis, legal research, financial analysis -- under the assumption they can be governed by norms. This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.\n  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.\n  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u4e8eRLHF\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u89c4\u8303\u6cbb\u7406\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u8ba8\u597d\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u7b49\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u8b66\u544a\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5931\u6548\u7684\"\u8d8b\u540c\u5371\u673a\"\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8eRLHF\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u53ef\u88ab\u89c4\u8303\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5176\u6839\u672c\u6027\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u4e0d\u53ef\u901a\u7ea6\u6027\u4e0e\u5426\u5b9a\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u4e8eRLHF\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u800c\u975e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eRLHF\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u672c\u8d28\uff08\u6807\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u59cb\u7ec8\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\u8f93\u51fa\uff09\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u89c4\u8303\u6cbb\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u800c\u975e\u5076\u7136\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\"\u8d8b\u540c\u5371\u673a\"\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e8c\u7ea7\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u88ab\u89c4\u8303\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u662f\u65e0\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u3001\u4e0e\u57fa\u8d28\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u89c4\u8303\u3002"}}

However, existing methods still fail to achieve satisfactory accuracy and scalability. In this work, we identify a parameter democratization effect as a key bottleneck: the sensitivity of all parameters becomes homogenized, severely limiting expressivity. To address this, we propose pQuant, a method that decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch dedicated to preserving the most sensitive parameters. Through tailored feature scaling, we explicitly guide the model to allocate sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch. Furthermore, we extend this branch into multiple, sparsely-activated experts, enabling efficient capacity scaling.

Schiffman"], "title": "Transformers converge to invariant algorithmic cores", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models exhibit sophisticated capabilities, yet understanding how they work internally remains a central challenge. A fundamental obstacle is that training selects for behavior, not circuitry, so many weight configurations can implement the same function. Which internal structures reflect the computation, and which are accidents of a particular training run? This work extracts algorithmic cores: compact subspaces necessary and sufficient for task performance. Independently trained transformers learn different weights but converge to the same cores. Markov-chain transformers embed 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces yet recover identical transition spectra. Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, yielding a predictive model of the memorization-to-generalization transition.

While recent continual learning studies have made progress in addressing catastrophic forgetting, the problem of fairness caused the imbalanced data remains largely underexplored. This paper presents a novel Fairness Direct Preference Optimization (FaiDPO or $\u03c6$-DPO) framework for continual learning in LMMs. In particular, we first propose a new continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by aligning learning with pairwise preference signals. Then, we identify the limitations of conventional DPO in imbalanced data and present a new $\u03c6$-DPO loss that explicitly addresses distributional biases. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach addresses both forgetting and data imbalance. Additionally, to enable $\u03c6$-DPO-based continual learning, we construct pairwise preference annotations for existing benchmarks in the context of continual learning.

However, heterogeneous conditional contexts (e.g., observed history, missingness patterns or outlier covariates) can induce heavy-tailed per-example gradients. Under Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), these rare conditioning-driven heavy-tailed gradients disproportionately trigger global clipping, resulting in outlier-dominated updates, larger clipping bias, and degraded utility under a fixed privacy budget. In this paper, we propose DP-aware AdaLN-Zero, a drop-in sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism for conditional diffusion transformers that limits conditioning-induced gain without modifying the DP-SGD mechanism. DP-aware AdaLN-Zero jointly constrains conditioning representation magnitude and AdaLN modulation parameters via bounded re-parameterization, suppressing extreme gradient tail events before gradient clipping and noise injection. Empirically, DP-SGD equipped with DP-aware AdaLN-Zero improves interpolation/imputation and forecasting under matched privacy settings.

Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53(DRAs)\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\uff1a\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u968f\u673a\u6027\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5728DeepSearchQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8622%\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u7f72\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\u91cd\u590d\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5f15\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06DRAs\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bf9\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "1) \u964d\u4f4e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u7814\u7a76\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b2) \u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\uff1b3) \u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728DeepSearchQA\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1122%\u968f\u673a\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7f13\u89e3DRAs\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

The distributional properties of IRs can leak training-set membership signals, enabling Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) whose strength varies across layers. Although Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) mitigates such leakage, existing implementations employ per-example gradient clipping and a uniform, layer-agnostic noise multiplier, ignoring heterogeneous layer-wise MIA vulnerability. This paper introduces Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD (LM-DP-SGD), which adaptively allocates privacy protection across layers in proportion to their MIA risk. Specifically, LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on a public shadow dataset, extracts per-layer IRs from its train/test splits, and fits layer-specific MIA adversaries, using their attack error rates as MIA-risk estimates. Leveraging the cross-dataset transferability of MIAs, these estimates are then used to reweight each layer's contribution to the globally clipped gradient during private training, providing layer-appropriate protection under a fixed noise magnitude. We further establish theoretical guarantees on both privacy and convergence of LM-DP-SGD.

While predictive, these laws are descriptive rather than prescriptive: they characterize typical training, not optimal training. Surprisingly few works have successfully challenged the data-efficiency bounds implied by these laws -- which is our primary focus. To that end, we introduce the Geodesic Hypothesis, positing that token sequences trace geodesics on a smooth semantic manifold and are therefore locally linear. Building on this principle, we propose a novel Semantic Tube Prediction (STP) task, a JEPA-style regularizer that confines hidden-state trajectories to a tubular neighborhood of the geodesic. STP generalizes JEPA to language without requiring explicit multi-view augmentations. We show this constraint improves signal-to-noise ratio, and consequently preserves diversity by preventing trajectory collisions during inference. Empirically, STP allows LLMs to match baseline accuracy with 16$\\times$ less training data on the NL-RX-SYNTH dataset, directly violating the data term of Chinchilla-style scaling laws and demonstrating that principled geometric priors can surpass brute-force scaling.

However, most existing DP-FL approaches assume that all clients share a uniform privacy budget, an assumption that does not hold in real-world scenarios where privacy requirements vary widely. This privacy heterogeneity poses a significant challenge: conventional client selection strategies, which typically rely on data quantity, cannot distinguish between clients providing high-quality updates and those introducing substantial noise due to strict privacy constraints. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of privacy-aware client selection in DP-FL. We establish a theoretical foundation by deriving a convergence analysis that quantifies the impact of privacy heterogeneity on training error. Building on this analysis, we propose a privacy-aware client selection strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem, that adaptively adjusts selection probabilities to minimize training error. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 10% improvement in test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to existing baselines under heterogeneous privacy budgets.

While existing compression methods - ranging from self-training to Reinforcement Learning (RL) with length constraints - attempt to mitigate this, they often sacrifice reasoning capability for brevity. We identify a critical failure mode in these approaches: explicitly optimizing for shorter trajectories triggers rapid entropy collapse, which prematurely shrinks the exploration space and stifles the discovery of valid reasoning paths, particularly for challenging questions requiring extensive deduction. To address this issue, we propose Compress responses for Easy questions and Explore Hard ones (CEEH), a difficulty-aware approach to RL-based efficient reasoning.

In addition, we introduce a dynamic optimal-length penalty anchored to the historically shortest correct response, which effectively counteracts entropy-induced length inflation and stabilizes the reward signal.

However, recent explorations in universal graph pre-training primarily focus on homogeneous graphs and it remains unexplored for heterogeneous graphs, which exhibit greater structural and semantic complexity. This heterogeneity makes it highly challenging to train a universal encoder for diverse heterogeneous graphs: (i) the diverse types with dataset-specific semantics hinder the construction of a unified representation space; (ii) the number and semantics of meta-paths vary across datasets, making encoding and aggregation patterns learned from one dataset difficult to apply to others. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Meta-path-aware Universal heterogeneous Graph pre-training (MUG) approach. Specifically, for challenge (i), MUG introduces a input unification module that integrates information from multiple node and relation types within each heterogeneous graph into a unified representation.This representation is then projected into a shared space by a dimension-aware encoder, enabling alignment across graphs with diverse schemas.Furthermore, for challenge (ii), MUG trains a shared encoder to capture consistent structural patterns across diverse meta-path views rather than relying on dataset-specific aggregation strategies, while a global objective encourages discriminability and reduces dataset-specific biases.

However, most existing methods face challenges in learning effective knowledge from generic graphs, primarily due to simplistic data alignment and limited training guidance. The issue of simplistic data alignment arises from the use of a straightforward unification for highly diverse graph data, which fails to align semantics and misleads pre-training models. The problem with limited training guidance lies in the arbitrary application of in-domain pre-training paradigms to cross-domain scenarios. While it is effective in enhancing discriminative representation in one data space, it struggles to capture effective knowledge from many graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Latent sEmantic Distribution Alignment (LEDA) model for universal graph pre-training.

Furthermore, we design a variational semantic inference module to obtain the shared latent distribution. The distribution is then adopted to guide the domain projection, aligning it with shared semantics across domains and ensuring cross-domain semantic learning.

To address these limitations, we introduce Switch-Hurdle: a new framework that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) encoder with a Hurdle-based probabilistic decoder. The encoder uses a sparse Top-1 expert routing during the forward pass yet approximately dense in the backward pass via a straight-through estimator (STE).

To tackle this challenge, we introduce GeoPerceive, a benchmark comprising diagram instances paired with domain-specific language (DSL) representations, along with an efficient automatic data generation pipeline. This design enables the isolated evaluation of geometric perception independently from reasoning. To exploit the data provided by GeoPerceive for enhancing the geometric perception capabilities of VLMs, we propose GeoDPO, a translator-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework. GeoDPO employs an NL-to-DSL translator, which is trained on synthetic pairs generated by the data engine of GeoPerceive, to bridge natural language and DSL. This translator facilitates the computation of fine-grained, DSL-level scores, which serve as reward signals in reinforcement learning. We assess GeoDPO on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, spanning tasks in geometric perception as well as downstream reasoning.

Empirical comparisons are further confounded by variations in the underlying predictive models. To clarify this issue, we present a controlled comparative study enabling principled, like-for-like evaluation of the two paradigms. Both representations are constructed from the same finite collection of predictive distributions generated by a shared neural network, isolating representational effects from predictive accuracy. Our study evaluates each representation through the lens of 3 uncertainty measures across 8 benchmarks, including selective prediction and out-of-distribution detection, spanning 6 underlying predictive models and 10 independent runs per configuration.

To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

In deployment, however, prompts routinely include contextual signals such as user requests, cues on social norms, etc. that may steer decisions. We study how directed contextual influences reshape decisions in trolley-problem-style moral triage settings. We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples.

Our investigation demonstrates that MEDNA-DFM effectively captures conserved methylation patterns, achieving robust distinction across diverse species. Validation on external independent datasets confirms that the model's generalization is driven by conserved intrinsic motifs (e.g., GC content) rather than phylogenetic proximity. Furthermore, applying our developed algorithms extracted motifs with significantly higher reliability than prior studies. Finally, empirical evidence from a Drosophila 6mA case study prompted us to propose a \"sequence-structure synergy\" hypothesis, suggesting that the GAGG core motif and an upstream A-tract element function cooperatively.

While SHAP explanations are routinely computed independently for each output coordinate, the theoretical necessity of this practice has remained unclear. By extending the classical Shapley axioms to vector-valued cooperative games, we establish a rigidity theorem showing that any attribution rule satisfying efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, and additivity must necessarily decompose component-wise across outputs.

Across a range of models, we find that Aurora exhibits the strongest data-scaling behavior: increasing the training dataset by 10x reduces validation loss by up to 3.2x. GraphCast demonstrates the highest parameter efficiency, yet suffers from limited hardware utilization. Our compute-optimal analysis indicates that, under fixed compute budgets, allocating resources to longer training durations yields greater performance gains than increasing model size.

Existing contrastive methods utilize augmentations that distort morphology, whereas generative approaches employ fixed-window segmentation, which misaligns cardiac cycles. To address these limitations, we propose RhythmBERT, a generative ECG language model that considers ECG as a language paradigm by encoding P, QRS, and T segments into symbolic tokens via autoencoder-based latent representations. These discrete tokens capture rhythm semantics, while complementary continuous embeddings retain fine-grained morphology, enabling a unified view of waveform structure and rhythm. RhythmBERT is pretrained on approximately 800,000 unlabeled ECG recordings with a masked prediction objective, allowing it to learn contextual representations in a label-efficient manner. Evaluations show that despite using only a single lead, RhythmBERT achieves comparable or superior performance to strong 12-lead baselines.

To address this, we bridge the relationship between the algorithm's fast convergence and the requirements for subspace projection, and show that an effective compression should yield an unbiased estimate of the original activation with low variance. We propose Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression (PRAC), which novelly decomposes activations into two components: a principal subspace captured via SVD to retain dominant information, and a random subspace sampled from the orthogonal complement to approximate the tail. By introducing a precise scaling factor, we prove that PRAC yields an unbiased gradient estimator with minimum variance under certain conditions. Extensive experiments on pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that PRAC achieves up to 36% total memory reduction with negligible performance degradation and minimal computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u6279\u91cfLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u5360\u7528\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPRAC\u6fc0\u6d3b\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08SVD\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u6b63\u4ea4\u8865\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u6765\u5229\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u7cbe\u786e\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u504f\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b036%\u603b\u5185\u5b58\u524a\u51cf\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u6279\u91cfLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u7f13\u6162\u6216\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPRAC\uff08Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7SVD\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u53d6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u4e3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e3b\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u8865\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u968f\u673a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5c3e\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u7cbe\u786e\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bPRAC\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e14\u65b9\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cPRAC\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe36%\u7684\u603b\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u4f4e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "PRAC\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5c06\u6fc0\u6d3b\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65e0\u504f\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u6279\u91cfLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Among ML models, matrix completion methods (MCMs) have proven effective in predicting thermophysical properties, including diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures. However, MCMs are restricted to single-temperature predictions, and their accuracy depends strongly on the availability of high-quality experimental data for each temperature of interest. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a hybrid tensor completion method (TCM) for predicting temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures. The TCM employs a Tucker decomposition and is jointly trained on experimental data for diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary systems at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Predictions from the semi-empirical SEGWE model serve as prior knowledge within a Bayesian training framework. The TCM then extrapolates linearly to any temperature between 268 K and 378 K, achieving markedly improved prediction accuracy compared to established models across all studied temperatures. To further enhance predictive performance, the experimental database was expanded using active learning (AL) strategies for targeted acquisition of new diffusion data by pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR measurements. Diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in 19 solute + solvent systems were measured at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Incorporating these results yields a substantial improvement in the TCM's predictive accuracy.

It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps.

These repeats are important for protein structure and function, motivating decades of algorithmic work on repeat identification. Recent work has shown that protein language models (PLMs) identify repeats, by examining their behavior in masked-token prediction. To elucidate their internal mechanisms, we investigate how PLMs detect both exact and approximate repeats. We find that the mechanism for approximate repeats functionally subsumes that of exact repeats. We then characterize this mechanism, revealing two main stages: PLMs first build feature representations using both general positional attention heads and biologically specialized components, such as neurons that encode amino-acid similarity. Then, induction heads attend to aligned tokens across repeated segments, promoting the correct answer.

The architecture employs an encode-process-decode structure: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to perform dimensionality reduction, and a transformer network to evolve the latent states and model the dynamics. The ROM is parameterized by an external control variable, the Reynolds number in the Navier-Stokes setting, with the transformer exploiting attention mechanisms to capture both temporal dependencies and parameter effects. The probabilistic VAE enables stochastic sampling of trajectory ensembles, providing predictive means and uncertainty quantification through the first two moments. After initial training on a limited set of dynamical regimes, the model is adapted to out-of-sample parameter regions using only sparse data. Its probabilistic formulation naturally supports ensemble generation, which we employ within an ensemble Kalman filtering framework to assimilate data and reconstruct full-state trajectories from minimal observations. We further show that, for the dynamical system considered, the dominant source of error in out-of-sample forecasts stems from distortions of the latent manifold rather than changes in the latent dynamics.

However, accurate value estimation remains a challenge due to the limited coverage of the state-action space. Recent physics-informed approaches have sought to address this by imposing physical and geometric constraints on the value function through regularization defined over first-order partial differential equations (PDEs), such as the Eikonal equation. However, these formulations can often be ill-posed in complex, high-dimensional environments. In this work, we propose a physics-informed regularization derived from the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By providing a physics-based inductive bias, our approach grounds the learning process in optimal control theory, explicitly regularizing and bounding updates during value iterations. Furthermore, we leverage the Feynman-Kac theorem to recast the PDE solution as an expectation, enabling a tractable Monte Carlo estimation of the objective that avoids numerical instability in higher-order gradients.

This occurs naturally through measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and lag in economic systems. We study Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data, where each true sample $x$ is drawn from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covariance, but is revealed only through the set of a partition containing $x$. When the coarse samples, roughly speaking, have ``low'' information, the mean cannot be uniquely recovered from observed samples (i.e., the problem is not identifiable). Recent work by Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21] established that sample-efficient mean estimation is possible when the unknown mean is identifiable and the partition consists of only convex sets. Moreover, they showed that without convexity, mean estimation becomes NP-hard. However, two fundamental questions remained open: (1) When is the mean identifiable under convex partitions? (2) Is computationally efficient estimation possible under identifiability and convex partitions? This work resolves both questions.

Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload. Experiments on 10 diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach can transfer task knowledge with a payload of less than 1 MB while retaining high classification accuracy, offering a promising solution for efficient dataset serving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPLADA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ea\u4f20\u8f93\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u800c\u975e\u56fe\u50cf\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9884\u5b58\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c0f\u4e8e1MB\u7684\u8d85\u5c0f\u4f20\u8f93\u8f7d\u8377\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5411\u591a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u53d1\u5927\u578b\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4e14\u56e0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u4f20\u8f93\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u8db3\u591f\u5c0f\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u4e9f\u9700\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\"\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u6570\u636e\"\uff1a\u5047\u8bbe\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5df2\u9884\u5b58\u5927\u578b\u901a\u7528\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982ImageNet\uff09\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4ec5\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\u7b5b\u9009\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f20\u8f93\u8f7d\u8377\u5c0f\u4e8e1MB\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u50cf\u7d20\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "PLADA\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u50cf\u7d20\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}
