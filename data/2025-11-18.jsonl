However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components."}

This is mostly carried out by direct numerical solution of the dynamical equations. Though the origin of scrolls can be understood from the properties of dynamical equations, their appearance in the phase space can also be inferred from the geometry and relative orientations of Nambu surfaces, drawn using Nambu Hamiltonians than from direct numerical solutions. Therefore, one can attribute the origin of wings in the phase space due to energy like Nambu surfaces, giving a geometrical interpretation. In this article, we have carried out, both numerical analysis of bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponents(LEs) to characterise chaos and geometric approach by applying the Nambu generalized Hamiltonian mechanics to explain the fundamental reason for the appearance of wings like geometry in the phase space. We have shown how a fixed number of scrolls or wings can appear in the phase space due to specific geometry of the Nambu surfaces and how different geometries are formed when set of parameters are changed."}

Reformulating its dynamics in terms of effective parameters $k_r$ and $k_θ$, we analytically show exact periodicity of the Floquet operator for $k_r = jπ/2$ and $k_r = jπ/4$ with distinct periods for integer and half-odd integer $j$. These exact recurrences were found to be independent of $k_θ$. The long-time-averaged entanglement and fidelity rate function show dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) for $k_r = jπ/2$ at time-reversal symmetric cases $k_θ= \\pm k_r$. In the other time-reversal symmetric case $k_θ= 0$, the DQPT exists only for a half-odd integer $j$. Using level statistics, a smooth transition is observed from integrable to non-integrable nature as $k_r$ is changed away from $jπ/2$. Our work demonstrates that regular and chaotic regimes can be controlled for any system size by tuning $k_r$ and $k_θ$, making the DKT a useful platform for quantum control and information processing applications."}

Here, we argue it is a unique proxy of the energy landscape as determined by sample morphology and experienced by mobile charges. To determine α, we use that in disordered organic semiconductors, slow thermalization of charge carriers after excitation, e.g. by hopping in a finite electric field, can lead to an effective electronic temperature (T_eff) exceeding the lattice temperature, thereby enhancing conductivity. We experimentally probe this effect by combining temperature- and field-dependent conductivity measurements for a range of representative conjugated polymers, using different dopants, doping protocols and doping concentrations. We find that in the high-field regime (F>1E6V/m), T_eff exhibits distinct trends vs. structural order and doping level, which can be used to extract (effective) localization lengths ranging from ~1nm in fully amorphous systems to over ~10nm in highly ordered polymers. Tight-binding and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are used to connect measured values to morphological properties and to rule out alternative explanations. Our results demonstrate that finite-field conductivity measurements provide a powerful probe of a characteristic length scale of charge transport that is complementary to conventional structural characterization."}

Inspired by the global decoding insight of the unified decoder (Benhemou et al., 2023), this paper introduces a correlated decoder for the 4.8.8 color code, which improves upon the conventional restricted decoder by leveraging correlations between restricted lattices, and is derived by mapping the correlated matching decoder for the surface code onto the color code lattice. Analytical and numerical results show that the correlated decoder achieves higher thresholds than the restricted and unified decoders, while matching the performance of the unified decoder at very low physical error rates. Under the code capacity and phenomenological noise models, the estimated thresholds for the color code against bit-flip error are 10.38% and 3.13%, respectively. Furthermore, by applying the surface-color code mapping, the thresholds of 16.62% and 3.52% are obtained for the surface code against depolarizing noise."}

The damaged elements are modeled using damped oscillators; thus, the system is composed of both limit-cycle oscillators and damped oscillators. In this system, as is commonly observed in conventional coupled limit-cycle oscillators, synchronization among oscillators is destroyed when the difference between the natural frequencies of the oscillators increases. However, in the presence of damped oscillators, synchronization can be facilitated by further increasing the frequency difference from the desynchronization state. We conduct numerical simulations on coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators and investigate this reentrance of synchronization systematically. We also propose an approximate theory to predict the stability of the synchronization state based on a linear stability analysis of the fixed point, which reveals the appearance of the Hopf modes. Using this theory, we argue that the reentrance of synchronization driven by increasing frequency differences can be observed in a wide range of coupled-oscillator systems with damaged elements."}

Notably, when the DC conductivity approaches zero, the AC conductivity reveals a multi-peak structure, which can be attributed to the Mott and charge-transfer gaps observed experimentally in transition metals.

Exceptions, however, occur in the new phenomenon of non-Hermitian skin criticality, where closely competing generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) solutions for non-Hermitian state accumulation give rise to anomalously scaling complex spectra. In this work, we discover that such non-Hermitian criticality can generically emerge from stochasticity in the lattice bond orientation, a surprising phenomenon only possible in 2D or beyond. Marked by system size-dependent amplification rate, it can be physically traced to the proliferation of feedback loops arising from excess local non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) accumulation induced by structural disorder. While weak disorder weakens the amplification as intuitively anticipated, stronger disorder enigmatically strengthens the amplification almost universally, scaling distinctly from conventional critical system. By representing cascades of local excess NHSE as ensembles of effectively coupled chains, we analytically derived a critical GBZ that predicts how state amplification scales with the system size and disorder strength, highly consistent with empirical observations. Our new mechanism for disordered-facilitated amplification applies generically to structurally perturbed non-Hermitian lattices with broken reciprocity, and would likely find applications in non-Hermitian sensing through various experimentally mature meta-material platforms."}

The appropriate thermodynamic limit in a trapped Bose gas consists in taking the limit $N\\to \\infty$ and $ω\\to 0$ with their product $ρ= N ω^d$ fixed, where $ρ$ plays the role analogous to the density in a translationally invariant system. In this thermodynamic limit and in dimensions $d>1$, the harmonically trapped Bose gas undergoes a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) transition as the density $ρ$ crosses a critical value $ρ_c(β)$, where $β$ denotes the inverse temperature. We show that the probability distribution $P_β(I,N)$ of $I$ admits a large deviation form $P_β(I,N) \\sim e^{-V Φ(I/V)}$ where $V = ω^{-d} \\gg 1$. We compute explicitly the rate function $Φ(z)$ and show that it exhibits a singularity at a critical value $z=z_c$ where its second derivative undergoes a discontinuous jump. We show that the existence of such a singularity in the rate function is directly related to the existence of a BEC transition and it disappears when the system does not have a BEC transition as in $d \\leq 1$. An interesting consequence of our results is that even if the actual system is in the fluid phase, i.e., when $ρ< ρ_c(β)$, by measuring the distribution of $I$ and analysing the singularity in the associated rate function, one can get a signal of the BEC transition in $d>1$.

However, the distillation process itself often remains costly for large datasets, since it requires the teacher to label a vast number of samples while incurring significant token consumption. To alleviate this challenge, in this work we explore the active learning (AL) as a way to create efficient student models at a fraction of the cost while preserving the LLM's performance. In particular, we introduce M-RARU (Multi-class Randomized Accept/Reject Uncertainty Sampling), a novel AL algorithm that significantly reduces training costs. M-RARU employs an innovative strategy combining uncertainty with a randomized accept-reject mechanism to select only the most informative data points for the LLM teacher. This focused approach significantly minimizes required API calls and data processing time. We evaluate M-RARU against random sampling across five diverse student models (SVM, LDA, RF, GBDT, and DistilBERT) on multiple benchmark datasets.

By deriving the circuit structure and providing a general recipe for constructing it, we obtain quantum circuits that generate the samples required for parameter updates, yielding constant scaling with respect to the cost of a forward pass, analogous to backpropagation in classical neural networks. Numerical results demonstrate that it attains comparable accuracy to likelihood-based optimization while requiring substantially fewer samples. The framework thereby establishes a scalable route to training expressive quantum generative models directly on quantum hardware."}

Here, we study the large n limit of the $O(n)$ model on general graphs, which is considerably more difficult than on regular lattices. Indeed, the loss of translational invariance gives rise to an infinite set of saddle point constraints in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the free energy at low and high temperature $T$ is determined by the spectrum of two crucial objects from graph theory: the Laplacian matrix at low $T$ and the Adjacency matrix at high $T$. Their interplay is studied in several classes of graphs. For regular lattices the two coincide. We obtain an exact solution on trees, where the Lagrange multipliers interestingly depend solely on the number of nearest neighbors. For decorated lattices, the singular part of the free energy is governed by the Laplacian spectrum, whereas this is true for the full free energy only in the zero temperature limit. Finally, we discuss a bipartite fully connected graph to highlight the importance of a finite coordination number in these results. Results for quantum spin models on a loopless graph are also presented."}

The increasing popularity of algorithmic decision-making has stimulated interest in algorithmic fairness within the academic community. Researchers have introduced various fairness definitions that quantify disparities between privileged and protected groups, use causal inference to determine the impact of race on model predictions, and that test calibration of probability predictions from the model. Existing literature does not provide a way in which to assess whether observed disparities between groups are statistically significant or merely due to chance. This paper introduces a rigorous framework for testing the statistical significance of fairness violations by leveraging k-fold cross-validation [2] to generate sampling distributions of fairness metrics. This paper introduces statistical tests that can be used to identify statistically significant violations of fairness metrics based on disparities between predicted and actual outcomes, model calibration, and causal inference techniques [1]. We demonstrate this approach by testing recidivism forecasting algorithms trained on data from the National Institute of Justice. Our findings reveal that machine learning algorithms used for recidivism forecasting exhibit statistically significant bias against Black individuals under several fairness definitions, while also exhibiting no bias or bias against White individuals under other definitions. The results from this paper underscore the importance of rigorous and robust statistical testing while evaluating algorithmic decision-making systems."}

The model effective Hamiltonian is a function of mode amplitudes with random frequencies and is defined on a complete mode-locked graph. Using large-scale GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations with the Parallel Tempering algorithm, we analyze systems of varying sizes to probe their thermodynamic-limit behavior. Finite-size scaling of the specific heat, of the Parisi overlap distributions, and of the inverse participation ratio's reveals a spin-glass transition, with critical exponents matching the mean-field Random Energy Model universality class. The smoothed-cubic constraint produces broad, non-condensed intensity distributions, avoiding the pseudo-condensation seen in spherical models on the same interaction graph.

For a boundary driven lattice with such engineered quantum channels, the analysis of the full counting statistics of current across boundaries has received limited attention. In this work, we consider a boundary driven free fermionic lattice with carefully engineered correlated gain and loss channels and obtain the cumulant generating function of the steady-state particle current. We also discuss the limit for simplifying the correlated gain-loss channel to a local gain-loss channel and obtain the average current and its fluctuation in such cases. Generally, in the presence of gain-loss, the current statistics are different at the two ends of the lattice. Hence, for both local and correlated gain-loss, we devise the conditions for which the statistics can coincide, giving rise to a $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric balanced gain-loss scenario. A striking difference between the correlated gain-loss and their local counterpart is the emergence of nonreciprocity in the system and we observe that it has a dramatic impact in the current as well as fluctuations. Our work therefore provides interesting insights about the importance of engineered dissipators in boundary driven systems."}

This \"hallucination\" problem has become a major barrier to using these models where accuracy matters most. Existing solutions either require retraining the entire model, add significant computational costs, or miss the root causes of why these hallucinations occur in the first place.\n  We present CausalGuard, a new approach that combines causal reasoning with symbolic logic to catch and prevent hallucinations as they happen. Unlike previous methods that only check outputs after generation, our system understands the causal chain that leads to false statements and intervenes early in the process. CausalGuard works through two complementary paths: one that traces causal relationships between what the model knows and what it generates, and another that checks logical consistency using automated reasoning.\n  Testing across twelve different benchmarks, we found that CausalGuard correctly identifies hallucinations 89.3\\% of the time while missing only 8.3\\% of actual hallucinations. More importantly, it reduces false claims by nearly 80\\% while keeping responses natural and helpful. The system performs especially well on complex reasoning tasks where multiple steps of logic are required. Because CausalGuard shows its reasoning process, it works well in sensitive areas like medical diagnosis or financial analysis where understanding why a decision was made matters as much as the decision itself."}

In the non-interacting limit, these profoundly alter the electronic structure, leading to the emergence of flat bands, van Hove singularities, and, most notably, Dirac cones within a single Kondo-Dirac semimetal order. The strongly interacting regime is explored via the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, in the absence of the sign problem, where we unveil a complete ground-state phase diagram revealing two distinct phases, the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase and a novel antiferromagnetic semimetal phase. Their characterization by the spectral functions establishes an orbital-selective Mott transition in the antiferromagnetic semimetal phase, marked by the opening of a gap exclusively in the $f$-orbital while Dirac cones persist in the $c$-orbital. Conversely, in the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase, both $c$- and $f$-orbitals sustain robust Dirac cones. We establish that spin-orbit coupling in the hybridization term gives rise to Dirac cones, which, combined with additional symmetry-breaking conditions, can generate novel topological states."}

In Transformers, positional information is typically encoded using Positional Encodings (PEs). One such popular PE, namely Rotary PE (RoPE), has been widely used due to its empirical success. Recently, it has been argued that part of RoPE's success emerges from its ability to encode robust positional and semantic information using large and small frequencies, respectively. In this work, we perform a deeper dive into the positional versus symbolic dichotomy of attention heads behavior, both at the theoretical and empirical level. We provide general definitions of what it means for a head to behave positionally or symbolically, prove that these are two mutually exclusive behaviors and develop a metric to quantify them. We apply our framework to analyze Transformer-based LLMs using RoPE and find that all heads exhibit a strong correspondence between behavior and frequency use. Finally, we introduce canonical tasks designed to be either purely positional or symbolic, and demonstrate that the Transformer performance causally relates to the ability of attention heads to leverage the appropriate frequencies. In particular, we show that we can control the Transformer performance by controlling which frequencies the attention heads can access. Altogether, our work provides a detailed understanding of RoPE, and how its properties relate to model behavior."}

However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems.

The proposed measures capture both transient and stationary dynamics, allowing systematic comparisons across systems with varying interaction parameters, network weights, or topologies. Our analysis shows that even subtle structural changes can lead to markedly distinct outcomes: in two-species systems, interaction strength and initial conditions strongly affect divergence, while in small directed networks, differences that are invisible at the adjacency-matrix level produce divergent dynamics. In modular networks, the fraction and distribution of negative interactions control the transition from stable to unstable dynamics, with localized perturbations within cliques yielding different global outcomes than distributed ones. Beyond structural variations, the framework also applies when modified processes follow distinct nonlinear equations, demonstrating its versatility. Taken together, these results highlight that dynamical dissimilarity measures provide a powerful tool to analyze robustness, detect structural sensitivity, and predict instabilities in nonlinear systems. More broadly, this approach supports the comparative analysis of biological systems, where complex interaction networks and nonlinear dynamics are central to stability and resilience."}

To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity.

This antiferromagnetism is Ising-like and has a tricritical point in the magnetic field ($H$) -temperature ($T$) phase diagram. Since the temperature of the tricritical point is expected to decrease with increasing pressure ($P$), we investigated the pressure dependence of the magnetic phase transitions. We determined the $H$-$P$ phase diagram and revealed that a first-order phase-transition line changes to a quantum critical line, which implies the existence of the quantum tricritical point. A ferromagnetic quantum fluctuation arises in the vicinity of the possible quantum tricritical point."}

AI-generated creative ideas in science are rare and often vague, so that it remains a human task to execute them. Automating idea generation and implementation in one coherent system would significantly shift the role of humans in the scientific process. Here we present AI-Mandel, an LLM agent that can generate and implement ideas in quantum physics. AI-Mandel formulates ideas from the literature and uses a domain-specific AI tool to turn them into concrete experiment designs that can readily be implemented in laboratories. The generated ideas by AI-Mandel are often scientifically interesting - for two of them we have already written independent scientific follow-up papers. The ideas include new variations of quantum teleportation, primitives of quantum networks in indefinite causal orders, and new concepts of geometric phases based on closed loops of quantum information transfer. AI-Mandel is a prototypical demonstration of an AI physicist that can generate and implement concrete, actionable ideas. Building such a system is not only useful to accelerate science, but it also reveals concrete open challenges on the path to human-level artificial scientists."}

Our method first retrieves behaviorally relevant entities from a user's transaction KG and then uses this context to filter temporally consistent signals from a market KG, constructing a compact, grounded subgraph for the LLM. This pipeline reduces context overhead and sharpens the model's focus on relevant information. Empirical evaluation on a real-world financial transaction dataset demonstrates that RAG-FLARKO significantly enhances recommendation quality.

Within the bias area, several heavy-metal wires carrying dc charge current are periodically attached to the waveguide and exert so spatially periodic spin-orbit torques, producing current-controllable modulated magnon gain and loss. It is demonstrated that this decorated waveguide can emit a strong, single frequency magnon mode at the Bragg point (lasing) and also absorb at the same frequency phase-matched incoming coherent magnons (anti-lasing). The underlying physics is captured by an analytical model and validated with full material and device-specific numerical simulations. The magnonic laser absorber response is tunable via the current density in the wires, the extent of the biased region, and the intrinsic damping, enabling the control of lasing frequency and emission power. The structure is shown to amplify thermal magnons, offering a route to low-noise on-chip microwave sources. The concept is compatible with planar waveguides, ring geometries, and antiferromagnets. The results establish an experimentally realistic platform where a single element functions simultaneously as both magnon laser and absorber, opening opportunities for reconfigurable non-Hermitian magnonics and integrated magnon signal processing."}

Current methods lack the adaptive policies needed to dynamically debug queries based on real-time execution feedback. This paper introduces a novel agentic framework where an LLM learns a resilient policy for the sequential process of iterative SPARQL construction. We show that a compact 3B-parameter model, trained exclusively via outcome-driven Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) without supervised fine-tuning, can learn effective policies for this task, discovering how to systematically recover from execution errors and refine its queries toward a correct answer. On a curated, executable single-answer subset of LC-QuAD 2.0, our agent achieves 49.7\\% accuracy post-entity-linking, a significant 17.5 percentage point improvement over the strongest iterative zero-shot baseline. Further analysis reveals that while the agent's capability is driven by RL, its performance is enhanced by an explicit deliberative reasoning step that acts as a cognitive scaffold to improve policy precision. This work presents a generalizable blueprint for teaching agents to master formal, symbolic tools through interaction, bridging the gap between probabilistic LLMs and the structured world of Knowledge Graphs."}

First, when a model is trained to produce a safe-looking output, that model may generalize to making its CoTs look safe. Second, since later tokens are conditioned on earlier ones, safe-looking CoTs may increase the likelihood of safe outputs, causing safe-looking CoTs to be reinforced.

Most near-term approaches are cast as variational energy minimization and thus inherit the challenges of problem-specific energy landscapes. We develop the quantum amplitude-amplification eigensolver (QAAE), which departs from the variational paradigm and instead coherently drives a trial state toward the ground state via quantum amplitude amplification. Each amplitude-amplification round interleaves a reflection about the learned trial state with a controlled short-time evolution under a normalized Hamiltonian; an ancilla readout yields an amplitude-amplified pure target state that a state-learning step then re-encodes into an ansatz circuit for the next round -- without evaluating the energy gradients. Under standard assumptions (normalized $\\hat{H}$, a nondegenerate ground-state, and a learning update), the ground-state overlap increases monotonically per round and the procedure converges; here, a per-round depth bound in terms of the ansatz depth and Hamiltonian-simulation cost establishes hardware compatibility. Cloud experiments on IBMQ processor verify our amplification mechanism on a two-level Hamiltonian and a two-qubit Ising model, and numerical benchmarks on $\\mathrm{H}_2$, $\\mathrm{LiH}$, and a $10$-qubit longitudinal-and-transverse-field Ising model show that QAAE integrates with chemistry-inspired and hardware-efficient circuits and can surpass gradient-based VQE in accuracy and stability.

The Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts how the defect density scales with the quench rate. During such processes, dissipation also arises as the system fails to adiabatically follow the control protocol near the critical point. Quantifying and minimizing this dissipation is fundamentally relevant to nonequilibrium thermodynamics and practically important for energy-efficient computing and devices. However, there are no prior experimental measurements of dissipation, or the optimization of control protocols to reduce it in many-body systems. In addition, it is an open question to what extent dissipation is correlated with the formation of defects. Here, we directly measure the dissipation generated during the voltage-driven Freedericksz transition of a liquid crystal with a sensitivity equivalent to a ~10 nanokelvin temperature rise. We observe Kibble-Zurek scaling of dissipation and its breakdown, both in quantitative agreement with existing theoretical works. We further implement a fully automated in-situ optimization approach that discovers more optimal driving protocols, reducing dissipation by a factor of three relative to a simple linear protocol."}

Optimizing for such benchmarks risks misaligning evaluation with real-world utility. Our perspective is that evaluation should be grounded in generality rather than abstract notions of intelligence. We identify three assumptions that often underpin intelligence-focused evaluation: generality, stability, and realism. Through conceptual and formal analysis, we show that only generality withstands conceptual and empirical scrutiny. Intelligence is not what enables generality; generality is best understood as a multitask learning problem that directly links evaluation to measurable performance breadth and reliability. This perspective reframes how progress in AI should be assessed and proposes generality as a more stable foundation for evaluating capability across diverse and evolving tasks."}

Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrains client updates to a compact subspace, which reduces uplink traffic by more than 99 percent versus full-model FedAvg, stabilizes aggregation under non-IID data, and naturally supports personalization because each client can keep a locally tuned adapter. On language modeling (PTB) and image generation (CIFAR-10), FedGen-Edge achieves lower perplexity/FID and faster convergence than strong baselines while retaining a simple FedAvg-style server. A brief ablation shows diminishing returns beyond moderate LoRA rank and a trade-off between local epochs and client drift.

For the extended model, we examine moderate (U=4) and strong (U=10) coupling regimes, where conventional structure factors reveal familiar crossovers among charge, spin and local-pairing correlations. PCA of the corresponding correlation matrices captures these crossovers directly from the data, without assuming predefined order parameters by identifying charge-dominated, spin-dominated and pairing-dominated regimes through variance condensation into leading components. This establishes PCA as a transparent, model-agnostic framework for uncovering the hierarchy and competition of correlation channels in finite Hubbard lattice clusters, providing a bridge between exact diagonalization and modern machine-learning diagnostics in strongly correlated systems."}

Striking macroscopic consequences include exceptionally long-lived prethermalization and non-ergodic bimodal distributions of macroscopic observables. Superheating is predicated on a heating rate depending strongly on the local fluctuation; in our example, this is supplied by a sharp state-selective spin-echo, where the energy absorption is strongly suppressed for low-energy states, while thermal fluctuations open up excessive heating channels.

This is useful, e.g., for specifying and verifying desired system properties. While translating FOL into human-readable English is relatively straightforward, the inverse problem, converting NL to FOL (NL-FOL translation), has remained a longstanding challenge, for both humans and machines. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised a breakthrough, recent literature provides contrasting results on their ability to perform NL-FOL translation. In this work, we provide a threefold contribution. First, we critically examine existing datasets and protocols for evaluating NL-FOL translation performance, revealing key limitations that may cause a misrepresentation of LLMs' actual capabilities. Second, to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel evaluation protocol explicitly designed to distinguish genuine semantic-level logical understanding from superficial pattern recognition, memorization, and dataset contamination. Third, using this new approach, we show that state-of-the-art, dialogue-oriented LLMs demonstrate strong NL-FOL translation skills and a genuine grasp of sentence-level logic, whereas embedding-centric models perform markedly worse."}

However, their lower-dimensional counterpart, one-dimensional (1D) moiré superlattices, remain largely unexplored. Electrons in 1D are generally described by Luttinger liquid theory, with universal scaling relations depending only on the Luttinger parameter g. In particular, at half-filling, Umklapp scattering plays a crucial role, as it can significantly change the conductance-temperature scaling relation and lead to Mott insulators. However, this prediction has never been observed since doping an empty band to half-filling was extremely difficult. Here, we show that the marriage of moiré superlattices and 1D electrons makes it possible to study the Luttinger liquid in an exceptionally wide filling region simply by electrical gating. We perform transport measurements on 1D moiré superlattices of carbon nanotubes on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, and observe correlated insulating states at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings of the superlattice mini-band, where Umklapp scattering becomes dominant. We also observe a T-linear conductance at these commensurate fillings over a range of temperatures.

However, this makes the visual perception module a bottleneck, which constrains the overall capabilities of LVLMs. Conventional evaluation benchmarks, while rich in visual semantics, often contain unavoidable local shortcuts that can lead to an overestimation of models' perceptual abilities. Here, we introduce TopoPerception, a benchmark that leverages topological properties to rigorously evaluate the global visual perception capabilities of LVLMs across various granularities. Since topology depends on the global structure of an image and is invariant to local features, TopoPerception enables a shortcut-free assessment of global perception, fundamentally distinguishing it from semantically rich tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on TopoPerception and find that even at the coarsest perceptual granularity, all models perform no better than random chance, indicating a profound inability to perceive global visual features. Notably, a consistent trend emerge within model families: more powerful models with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit lower accuracy. This suggests that merely scaling up models is insufficient to address this deficit and may even exacerbate it. Progress may require new training paradigms or architectures. TopoPerception not only exposes a critical bottleneck in current LVLMs but also offers a lens and direction for improving their global visual perception. The data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/Wenhao-Zhou/TopoPerception."}

However, two bottlenecks still limit further performance improvement: (1) non-stationary Q-value estimation caused by jointly injecting entropy and updating its weighting parameter, i.e., temperature; and (2) short-sighted local entropy tuning that adjusts temperature only according to the current single-step entropy, without considering the effect of cumulative entropy over time. In this paper, we extends maximum entropy framework by proposing a trajectory entropy-constrained reinforcement learning (TECRL) framework to address these two challenges. Within this framework, we first separately learn two Q-functions, one associated with reward and the other with entropy, ensuring clean and stable value targets unaffected by temperature updates. Then, the dedicated entropy Q-function, explicitly quantifying the expected cumulative entropy, enables us to enforce a trajectory entropy constraint and consequently control the policy long-term stochasticity. Building on this TECRL framework, we develop a practical off-policy algorithm, DSAC-E, by extending the state-of-the-art distributional soft actor-critic with three refinements (DSAC-T). Empirical results on the OpenAI Gym benchmark demonstrate that our DSAC-E can achieve higher returns and better stability."}

Recently (F. Caleca et al., arXiv:2412.15493) we have shown that systems of half-integer spins with an odd number of sites and a parity-preserving Hamiltonian can retain a finite magnetization, hence exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) at finite size. Here we generalize this phenomenon to spin chains whose low-energy physics (in zero field) realizes a Luttinger-liquid phase. We observe that odd-sized chains can exhibit a phenomenon of finite-size quasi-SSB, in which a net sub-extensive magnetization, $M \\sim N^{1-1/(4K)}$ is retained, where $N$ is the number of sites and $K$ the Luttinger exponent. Interestingly, the states prepared by turning off the symmetry-breaking field quasi-adiabatically display scalable spin squeezing -- namely stronger the bigger the system -- regardless of the parity of $N$. The scaling of the squeezing parameter is dictated again by the Luttinger exponent, $ξ_R^2 \\sim N^{-1+1/(2K)}$. This result shows that scalable quantum correlations with metrological significance, associated typically with high-dimensional systems, can be found as well in gapless one-dimensional ones; and they are a direct consequence of the critical nature of Luttinger liquids."}

We systematically compare policies across four observability regimes, from full-state access to experimentally accessible observables (energies of individual two-level systems (TLSs), first-order averages, and second-order correlations). Simulation results demonstrate that full observability yields near-optimal ergotropy with low variability, while under partial observability, access to only single-TLS energies or energies plus first-order averages lags behind the fully observed baseline. However, augmenting partial observations with second-order correlations recovers most of the gap, reaching 94%-98% of the full-state baseline. The learned schedules are nonmyopic, trading temporary plateaus or declines for superior terminal outcomes. These findings highlight a practical route to effective fast-charging protocols under realistic information constraints."}

The preservation of Hermitian phase transition features in the non-Hermitian setting is rooted in the persistence and emergence of symmetries and their breaking. Specifically, the ferromagnetic (FM) phase arises from the breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry, while the Luttinger liquid (LL) phase is enabled by the emergence of a $U(1)$ symmetry together with the degeneracy of the real part of the energy spectrum. The nontrivial topology of the LL phase are characterized by the winding number around the exceptional point (EP).

Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks.

Two types of external-field setups are considered: One is a circularly polarized electromagnetic field and the other is a combination of a circularly polarized electric field and a static magnetic field. The system is modeled by a classical frustrated Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice, whose ground state is a single-$Q$ spiral spin configuration. The effects of irradiated electric and magnetic fields are taken into account by the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and the Zeeman coupling, respectively, without heating effects. By numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that the two field configurations lead to distinct skyrmion crystal (SkX) phases and their associated topological phase transitions: in the former setup, SkXs composed of skyrmions with skyrmion numbers of one and two with opposite signs emerge, whereas in the latter setup, SkXs with the same sign appear. The stabilization mechanisms of these SkXs are accounted for by the competition among electromagnetic-field-induced chiral DM interactions, electric-field-induced three-spin interactions, and the Zeeman coupling based on the high-frequency expansion within the Floquet formalism. Furthermore, for the latter setup, we find that the stability region of the SkX phase varies significantly depending on the timing of the application of the circularly polarized electric field and the static magnetic field. Our findings would broaden the possible routes to generate and control SkXs by time-dependent electromagnetic fields, advancing both the theoretical comprehension and experimental control of topological spin crystals."}

Our core innovation is a comprehensive channel-constrained framework: we model the diffusion and denoising steps as quantum channels defined by Kraus operators, ensure their physical validity through optimization on the Stiefel manifold, and introduce tailored training strategies and loss functions that leverage this constrained structure for high-fidelity state reconstruction. Experimental validation on systems ranging from single qubits to entangled states $7$ -qubits demonstrates high-fidelity state generation, achieving fidelities exceeding $0.998$ under both random and depolarizing noise conditions.

Such learning schemes exhibit several advantages, especially in relation to filtering out noisy observations. However, they may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In multi-player weakly-acyclic games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. To address this main limitation, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization, namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA). In this class of dynamics, and contrary to standard reinforcement-based learning schemes, each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This is the first part of the paper that characterizes stochastic stability in generic non-zero-sum games by establishing equivalence of the induced infinite-dimensional Markov chain with a finite dimensional one. In the second part, stochastic stability is further specialized to weakly acyclic games."}

Dynamical decoupling is a widely used, powerful technique for decoherence error suppression. However, it is susceptible to control errors, making non-robust sequences like UDD impractical to implement and robust ones like CPMG to significantly overestimate decoherence times. This overestimation issue remains largely unexplored in the past few decades, leading to many reports of exceptionally long yet plausible decoherence times across various qubit platforms. Here, we construct Hadamard phase cycling as a non-Markovian quantum error mitigation method for dynamical decoupling. This method exploits group structure to design phase configurations of equivalent ensemble quantum circuits, effectively eliminates circuit outputs generated from erroneous dynamics, and scales linearly with circuit depth. Harnessing its error mitigation capability for ensemble solid-state electron spin qubits embedded in paramagnetic molecules and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond enables accurate acquisition of decoherence times. Applying Hadamard phase cycling on single trapped ion and superconducting transmon qubits effectively preserves their state fidelity during dynamical decoupling.

Despite the importance of moment operators, their properties have not been as explored for quantum channels. In this work we develop a theoretical framework to compute moment operators for ensembles of quantum channels, for all moment orders $t$, with a special focus on determining ensembles that can be used as points of reference. By deriving hierarchies between ensembles, via inequalities of their moment operator norms, we give them operational meaning, and define useful concepts such as that of channel $t$-designs. Finally, we perform theoretical and numerical studies which show that different types of noise can decrease the norm of the moment operators (e.g., depolarizing noise), as well as increase it (e.g., amplitude damping), and generalize noise-induced concentration phenomena to channel-design-induced phenomena.

This advancement challenges the precise prediction of future maintenance needs for assets, which is crucial for reducing downtime and operational costs. However, the effectiveness of data-driven methodologies in the nuclear sector requires extensive domain knowledge due to the complexity of the systems involved. Thus, this paper proposes a novel predictive maintenance methodology that combines data-driven techniques with domain knowledge from a nuclear equipment. The methodological originality of this paper is located on two levels: highlighting the limitations of purely data-driven approaches and demonstrating the importance of knowledge in enhancing the performance of the predictive models. The applicative novelty of this work lies in its use within a domain such as a nuclear industry, which is highly restricted and ultrasensitive due to security, economic and environmental concerns. A detailed real-world case study which compares the current state of equipment monitoring with two scenarios, demonstrate that the methodology significantly outperforms purely data-driven methods in failure prediction. While purely data-driven methods achieve only a modest performance with a prediction horizon limited to 3 h and a F1 score of 56.36%, the hybrid approach increases the prediction horizon to 24 h and achieves a higher F1 score of 93.12%."}

In two-dimensional triangular lattices, the coexistence of such exchange frustration along with geometric frustration gives rise to a rich landscape of competing magnetic phases, establishing monolayer triangular $d^7$ cobaltates as a compelling platform for frustrated magnetism. Here we investigate a representative triangular-lattice monolayer cobaltate CoBr$_2$, where first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a dominant nearest-neighbor $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hopping channel that enhances the ferromagnetic Kitaev-type exchange interactions. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg term is highly sensitive to a direct $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ hopping path and electronic correlations. The magnetic exchange parameters are evaluated using the hopping amplitudes obtained from DFT calculations within an exact diagonalization framework. We construct the first and third nearest neighbor Heisenberg exchange dependent $J_1$-$J_3$ magnetic phase diagram in the physically relevant regime and identify multiple competing ground states, including ferromagnetic, stripy, spiral, and $120^{\\circ}$ antiferromagnetic orders. The Luttinger-Tisza analysis further predicts a Z$_2$ vortex crystal phase, while exact diagonalization reveals a bond-nematic phase stabilized by the longer-range couplings. Going beyond the conventional bond-independent XXZ picture typically applied to Co$^{2+}$ systems, our results on monolayer CoBr$_2$ establish d$^7$ cobalt dihalides as a promising platform to explore the interplay of long-range Heisenberg and bond-dependent exchange interactions that can stabilize diverse magnetic ground states on a triangular lattice."}

Within the biorthogonal framework, we calculate the ground-state correlation functions and entanglement entropy, confirming that their scaling behavior remains identical to that in the Hermitian XY model. The preservation of Hermitian phase transition features in the non-Hermitian setting is rooted in the persistence and emergence of symmetries and their breaking. Specifically, the ferromagnetic (FM) phase arises from the breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry, while the Luttinger liquid (LL) phase is enabled by the emergence of a $U(1)$ symmetry together with the degeneracy of the real part of the energy spectrum. The nontrivial topology of the LL phase are characterized by the winding number around the exceptional point (EP).

To address this issue, we introduce the Clustering Orthogonal Weight Modified (COWM) layer, which can be integrated into the policy network of any RL algorithm and mitigate non-stationarity effectively. The COWM layer stabilizes the learning process by employing clustering techniques and a projection matrix. Our approach not only improves learning speed but also reduces gradient interference, thereby enhancing the overall learning efficiency. Empirically, the COWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves improvements of 9% and 12.6% in vision based and state-based DMControl benchmark.

We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation. Overall, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a dual role-stabilizing skyrmionic qubits while simultaneously inducing decoherence during gate operations."}

The model effective Hamiltonian is a function of mode amplitudes with random frequencies and is defined on a complete mode-locked graph. Using large-scale GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations with the Parallel Tempering algorithm, we analyze systems of varying sizes to probe their thermodynamic-limit behavior. Finite-size scaling of the specific heat, of the Parisi overlap distributions, and of the inverse participation ratio's reveals a spin-glass transition, with critical exponents matching the mean-field Random Energy Model universality class. The smoothed-cubic constraint produces broad, non-condensed intensity distributions, avoiding the pseudo-condensation seen in spherical models on the same interaction graph.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) should help us handle these climate challenges but its most promising solutions are not good at dealing with climate-disrupted data; specifically, machine learning methods that work from historical data-distributions, are not good at handling out-of-distribution, outlier events. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method, that treats the predictive problems around climate change as being, in part, due to class-imbalance issues; that is, prediction from historical datasets is difficult because, by definition, they lack sufficient minority-class instances of \"climate outlier events\". This novel data augmentation method -- called Counterfactual-Based SMOTE (CFA-SMOTE) -- combines an instance-based counterfactual method from Explainable AI (XAI) with the well-known class-imbalance method, SMOTE. CFA-SMOTE creates synthetic data-points representing outlier, climate-events that augment the dataset to improve predictive performance. We report comparative experiments using this CFA-SMOTE method, comparing it to benchmark counterfactual and class-imbalance methods under different conditions (i.e., class-imbalance ratios). The focal climate-change domain used relies on predicting grass growth on Irish dairy farms, during Europe-wide drought and forage crisis of 2018."}

We show that tokenizer configuration primarily governs the representational capacity and stability of the model, while transfer learning influences optimization efficiency and alignment. Using a combination of empirical training experiments and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate that pretrained models consistently leverage well-designed tokenizers more effectively, particularly at smaller vocabulary sizes. Conversely, misaligned tokenization can diminish or even invert the benefits of pretraining. These findings highlight the importance of careful tokenization in time series modeling and suggest that combining small, efficient vocabularies with pretrained weights is especially advantageous in multi-modal forecasting settings, where the overall vocabulary must be shared across modalities. Our results provide concrete guidance for designing tokenizers and leveraging transfer learning in discrete representation learning for continuous signals."}

We use the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as a case study because its complexity makes it a fertile domain for identifying conflicts. Our research offers a solution for detecting inconsistent provisions by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic logic.\n  LLM-based methods can support compliance, fairness, and statutory drafting, yet tax-specific applications remain sparse. A key challenge is that such models struggle with hierarchical processing and deep structured reasoning, especially over long text.\n  This research addresses these gaps through experiments using GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Prolog. GPT-4o was first used to translate Section 121 into Prolog rules and refine them in SWISH. These rules were then incorporated into prompts to test whether Prolog-augmented prompting improved GPT-4o's inconsistency detection. GPT-4o, whether prompted with natural language alone or with Prolog augmentation, detected the inconsistency in only one of three strategies (33 percent accuracy), but its reasoning quality differed: natural-language prompting achieved 100 percent rule coverage, while Prolog-augmented prompting achieved 66 percent, indicating more incomplete statutory analysis.\n  In contrast to probabilistic prompting, the hybrid Prolog model produced deterministic and reproducible results. Guided by GPT-5 for refinement, the model formalized the IRC section's competing interpretations and successfully detected an inconsistency zone. Validation tests confirm that the Prolog implementation is accurate, internally consistent, deterministic, and capable of autonomously identifying inconsistencies. These findings show that LLM-assisted formalization, anchored in symbolic logic, enables transparent and reliable statutory inconsistency detection."}

In this study, we analyzed pre-transplant electronic health records (EHR) spanning the period before surgery for 2,100 liver transplantation patients, including 42 cases of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), from a cohort treated at Mayo Clinic between 1992 and 2025.

We developed a multi-modal deep learning framework that dynamically fuses these modalities, handles irregular records with missing values, and addresses extreme class imbalance through AUC-based optimization. The developed framework outperforms all single-modal and multi-modal machine learning baselines, achieving an AUC of 0.836, an AUPRC of 0.157, a recall of 0.768, and a specificity of 0.803.

Quantum Augmented Networks (QuANets) address this by integrating quantum components in classical network infrastructure to improve robustness and end-to-end security. To enable such integration, Quantum Anonymous Notification (QAN) is a method to anonymously inform a receiver of an incoming quantum communication. Therefore, several quantum primitives will serve as core tools, namely, quantum voting, quantum anonymous protocols, quantum secret sharing, etc. However, all current quantum protocols can be compromised in the presence of several common channel noises. In this work, we propose an improved quantum anonymous notification (QAN) protocol that utilizes rotation operations on shared GHZ states to produce an anonymous notification in an n-user quantum-augmented network. We study the behavior of this modified QAN protocol under the dephasing noise model and observe stronger resilience to false notifications than earlier QAN approaches. The QAN framework is also proposed to be integrated with a machine-learning classifier, enhanced quantum-augmented network.

Statement autoformalization, a crucial first step in this process, aims to translate informal descriptions into machine-verifiable representations but remains a significant challenge. The core difficulty lies in the fact that existing methods often suffer from a lack of contextual awareness, leading to hallucination of formal definitions and theorems. Furthermore, current retrieval-augmented approaches exhibit poor precision and recall for formal library dependency retrieval, and lack the scalability to effectively leverage ever-growing public datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented framework based on DDR (\\textit{Direct Dependency Retrieval}) for statement autoformalization. Our DDR method directly generates candidate library dependencies from natural language mathematical descriptions and subsequently verifies their existence within the formal library via an efficient suffix array check. Leveraging this efficient search mechanism, we constructed a dependency retrieval dataset of over 500,000 samples and fine-tuned a high-precision DDR model. Experimental results demonstrate that our DDR model significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both retrieval precision and recall. Consequently, an autoformalizer equipped with DDR shows consistent performance advantages in both single-attempt accuracy and multi-attempt stability compared to models using traditional selection-based RAG methods."}

Adversarial attacks can subtly alter medical scans in ways invisible to the human eye yet powerful enough to mislead AI models, potentially causing serious misdiagnoses. Existing defenses often assume centralized data and struggle to cope with the decentralized and diverse nature of federated medical settings. In this work, we present MedFedPure, a personalized federated learning defense framework designed to protect diagnostic AI models at inference time without compromising privacy or accuracy. MedFedPure combines three key elements: (1) a personalized FL model that adapts to the unique data distribution of each institution; (2) a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that detects suspicious inputs by exposing hidden perturbations; and (3) an adaptive diffusion-based purification module that selectively cleans only the flagged scans before classification. Together, these steps offer robust protection while preserving the integrity of normal, benign images. We evaluated MedFedPure on the Br35H brain MRI dataset. The results show a significant gain in adversarial robustness, improving performance from 49.50% to 87.33% under strong attacks, while maintaining a high clean accuracy of 97.67%.

Furthermore, we derive an analytic expression for the rotation-gate fidelity under the assumption that the state lies within the $\\mathbb Z_2\\times\\mathbb Z_2$-protected Haldane phase, showing that it is determined by the post-measurement spin-spin correlation function and the failure probability. The observed enhancement of gate fidelity in the spin-1 XXZ chain originates from the strengthening of antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations near the AFM phase, which effectively suppresses failure states."}

Lattice-based key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) such as CRYSTALS-Kyber provide efficient quantum-resistant primitives but rely solely on computational hardness assumptions that are susceptible to hybrid classical-quantum attacks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)-certified Kyber protocol, which embeds quantum non-locality verification directly within the key exchange phase. The proposed design integrates CHSH entanglement tests using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs to yield measurable quantum advantage values exceeding classical correlation limits, thereby coupling information--theoretic quantum guarantees with lattice-based computational security. Formal reductions demonstrate that any polynomial-time adversary breaking the proposed KEM must either solve the Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE) problem or a Quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMA)-complete instance of the 2-local Hamiltonian problem, under the standard complexity assumption QMA $\\subset$ NP. The construction remains fully compatible with the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform, preserving chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) security and Kyber's efficiency profile. The resulting CHSH-augmented Kyber scheme therefore establishes a mathematically rigorous, hybrid post-quantum framework that unifies lattice cryptography and quantum non-locality to achieve verifiable, composable, and forward-secure key agreement."}

Most existing methods adopt end-to-end training to facilitate intuitive answer verification. However, they lack fine-grained supervision and progressive traceability throughout the reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5. Meanwhile, LAT not only outperforms the supervised fine-tuning baseline, which is trained to directly produce answers with attribution, but also exhibits stronger generalization across domains."}

Although recent deep learning and numerical acceleration methods have improved speed and scalability, they often rely on single CNN architectures or single neural operators, which struggle to generalize in unknown or complex geological settings and are ineffective at distinguishing diverse geological types. To address these issues, we propose a Structure-Aligned Encoder-Mixture-of-Operators (SA-EMO) architecture for velocity-field inversion under unknown subsurface structures. First, a structure-aligned encoder maps high-dimensional seismic wavefields into a physically consistent latent space, thereby eliminating spatio-temporal mismatch between the waveform and velocity domains, recovering high-frequency components, and enhancing feature generalization. Then, an adaptive routing mechanism selects and fuses multiple neural-operator experts, including spectral, wavelet, multiscale, and local operators, to predict the velocity model. We systematically evaluate our approach on the OpenFWI benchmark and the Marmousi2 dataset. Results show that SA-EMO significantly outperforms traditional CNN or single-operator methods, achieving an average MAE reduction of approximately 58.443% and an improvement in boundary resolution of about 10.308%. Ablation studies further reveal that the structure-aligned encoder, the expert-fusion mechanism, and the routing module each contribute markedly to the performance gains. This work introduces a new paradigm for efficient, scalable, and physically interpretable full-waveform inversion."}

At its core is a two-phase learning process that autonomously derives diagnostic criteria: diversification expands pathology-style explanations, while optimization refines them for accuracy.

The loading and unloading sequences generated by strain gauges can be identified through time series classification (TSC) algorithms. Recently, deep learning models, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success in the TSC task, as they can extract discriminative local features from the subsequences to identify the time series. However, we observe that only the local features may not be sufficient for expressing the time series, especially when the local sub-sequences between different time series are very similar, e.g., SGS data of aircraft wings in static strength experiments. Nevertheless, CNNs suffer from the limitation in extracting global features due to the nature of convolution operations. For extracting global features to more comprehensively represent the SGS time series, we propose two insights: (i) Constructing global features through feature engineering. (ii) Learning high-order relationships between local features to capture global features. To realize and utilize them, we propose a hypergraph-based global feature learning and fusion framework, which learns and fuses global features for semantic consistency to enhance the representation of SGS time series, thereby improving recognition accuracy. Our method designs are validated on industrial SGS and public UCR datasets, showing better generalization for unseen data in SGS recognition."}

By comparing simultaneous and individual estimation strategies, we demonstrate that the simultaneous approach offers a notable advantage in our system. To support this, we compute the quantum Fisher information matrices (QFIMs) based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD). Our results show that the quantum Cramér Rao bound (QCRB) associated with the RLD is consistently lower than that of the SLD, indicating superior estimation precision. From a physical standpoint, this improvement reflects the system's enhanced capacity to encode, transfer, and extract quantum information while allowing optimal control of fundamental interactions. We show that increasing the Rabi frequency, cavity loss rate, and the average number of photons and phonons, combined with reduced mechanical damping and temperature, enhances the system's sensitivity to the coupling parameters. These mechanisms act on the available quantum resources, such as entanglement, squeezing, and state purity, leading to more precise estimations. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that under certain conditions, heterodyne detection can closely approach the ultimate precision set by the QFIM. This suggests that a measurement strategy based on heterodyne detection can offer an efficient and practical route for estimating the couplings $G_{mc}$ and $G_{mb}$, paving the way for high precision hybrid quantum sensors."}

For high-dimensional, multi-objective optimization problems in this domain, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning algorithm: Multi-path Differentiated Clipping Proximal Policy Optimization (MPD-PPO). This algorithm employs a multi-branch policy architecture with differentiated gradient clipping constraints to ensure stable and efficient high-dimensional policy updates. Validated through experiments on width and thickness control in rubber tyre film production, MPD-PPO demonstrates substantial improvements in both tuning accuracy and operational efficiency. The framework successfully tackles key challenges, including high dimensionality, multi-objective trade-offs, and dynamic adaptation, thus delivering enhanced performance and production stability for real-time industrial deployment in tyre manufacturing."}

In this study, several deep learning approaches were evaluated, including recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), and transformers, to forecast grain size distributions during grain growth. Unlike full-field simulations, which are computationally demanding, the present work relies on mean-field statistical descriptors extracted from high-fidelity simulations. A dataset of 120 grain growth sequences was processed into normalized grain size distributions as a function of time. The models were trained to predict future distributions from a short temporal history using a recursive forecasting strategy. Among the tested models, the LSTM network achieved the highest accuracy (above 90\\%) and the most stable performance, maintaining physically consistent predictions over extended horizons while reducing computation time from about 20 minutes per sequence to only a few seconds, whereas the other architectures tended to diverge when forecasting further in time. These results highlight the potential of low-dimensional descriptors and LSTM-based forecasting for efficient and accurate microstructure prediction, with direct implications for digital twin development and process optimization."}

Recent studies have shown that self-improving AI focusing on prompt optimization can outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning fine-tuned LLMs. Here, their `performance' is typically measured by query efficiency - the number of LLM-generated solution samples required to meet a certain performance threshold. However, in many societal applications, the primary limitation is not generating new solutions but evaluating them. For instance, evaluating an ad's effectiveness requires significant human feedback, which is far more costly and time-consuming than generating a candidate ad. To optimize for the evaluation efficiency objective, a natural approach is to extend Bayesian Optimization (BO), a framework proven optimal for evaluation efficiency, to the language domain. However, the difficulty of directly estimating suitable acquisition functions in LLMs' minds makes this extension challenging. This paper overcomes this challenge by proving that the combination of the simple and widely used Best-of-N selection strategy and simple textual gradients (i.e., textual edits from a critic model) statistically emulates the behavior of the gradients on the canonical UCB acquisition function, which induces optimal exploration in terms of evaluation efficiency. Based on this result, we propose TextGrad-Best-of-N Bayesian Optimization (T-BoN BO), a simple and eval-efficient language-space Bayesian optimization framework for AI self-improvement. We also empirically validate T-BoN BO by applying it to automated ad alignment tasks for persona distribution, demonstrating its superior performance compared to popular state-of-the-art baselines."}

To improve the generalization, we explore the substructures of classifiers and propose a novel meta-learning algorithm to learn each classifier as a combination of meta-components. Meta-components are learned across meta-learning episodes on seen classes and disentangled by imposing an orthogonal regularizer to promote its diversity and capture various shared substructures among different classifiers. Extensive experiments on few-shot benchmark tasks show superior performances of the proposed method."}

Unlike collapse theories, EQM does not allow an action on one system to change the reduced density matrix (RDM) of a remote entangled system - a clear case of nonlocal action. However, EQM does allow an action on one system to change the global state of the system and its remote entangled partners. We argue that such changes should also count as nonlocal actions, meaning EQM is not local after all. First, we consider an argument to the contrary, which deems such global changes to be mere extrinsic changes, whereas nonlocal action requires intrinsic changes to the remote system. We respond that the intrinsic-extrinsic distinction is problematic and cannot hold the weight of this argument. We then try to clarify when actions that change global states count as nonlocal actions. We argue that it is when the global states are essential explanatory mechanisms of the theory. In EQM, the global state is needed to explain why, in an anti-correlated Bell state, Alice's measuring spin-up ensures that she encounters only the branch where Bob measures spin-down."}

Probabilistic calibration metrics (Brier Score and Expected Calibration Error) are incorporated to ensure reliable risk predictions across subgroups. Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost models were trained with isotonic and Platt scaling for calibration and fairness comparison. A calibrated Random Forest achieved a high predictive accuracy of 90.8%. SHAP analysis identified follicle count, weight gain, and menstrual irregularity as the most influential features, which are consistent with the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria.

Two improved PINN approaches were developed in this research: an adaptive approach with self-adaptive loss weighting and a conservative approach enforcing explicit conservation laws. Three benchmark tests were used to demonstrate how effective PINN's are as they relate to the type of problem being solved (i.e., time dependent RLW equation). The first was a single soliton traveling along a line (propagation), the second was the interaction between two solitons, and the third was the evolution of an undular bore over the course of $t=250$. The results demonstrated that the effectiveness of PINNs are problem specific. The adaptive PINN was significantly better than both the conservative PINN and the standard PINN at solving problems involving complex nonlinear interactions such as colliding two solitons. The conservative approach was significantly better at solving problems involving long term behavior of single solitons and undular bores. However, the most important finding from this research is that explicitly enforcing conservation laws may be harmful to optimizing the solution of highly nonlinear systems of equations and therefore requires special training methods. The results from our adaptive and conservative approaches were within $O(10^{-5})$ of established numerical solutions for the same problem, thus demonstrating that PINNs can provide accurate solutions to complex systems of partial differential equations without the need for a discretization of space or time (mesh free).

However, existing datasets and fine-tuning approaches still face challenges that lead to catastrophic forgetting, particularly for models smaller than 8B. First, most datasets typically ignore the relationship between training data knowledge and the model's inherent abilities, making it difficult to preserve prior knowledge. Second, conventional training objectives often fail to constrain inherent knowledge preservation, which can result in forgetting of previously learned skills. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive solution that alleviates catastrophic forgetting from both the data and fine-tuning approach perspectives. On the data side, we construct a dataset of 5K instances that covers multiple reasoning tasks and incorporates metacognitive knowledge, making it more tolerant and effective for distillation into smaller models. We annotate the metacognitive knowledge required to solve each question and filter the data based on task knowledge and the model's inherent skills. On the training side, we introduce GDPO (Group Direction Preference Optimization), which is better suited for resource-limited scenarios and can efficiently approximate the performance of GRPO. Guided by the large model and by implicitly constraining the optimization path through a reference model, GDPO enables more effective knowledge transfer from the large model and constrains excessive parameter drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly alleviates catastrophic forgetting and improves reasoning performance on smaller models."}

In this work, we utilize curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning to discover Bosonic codes under approximate AQEC framework to resist both single-photon and double-photon losses. We present an analytical solution of solving the master equation under approximation conditions, which can significantly accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning. The agent first identifies an encoded subspace surpassing the breakeven point through rapid exploration within a constrained evolutionary time-frame, then strategically fine-tunes its policy to sustain this performance advantage over extended temporal horizons.

In this work, we propose DRedMTL, an incremental reasoning algorithm for DatalogMTL with bounded intervals. Our algorithm builds upon the classical DRed algorithm, which incrementally updates the materialisation of a Datalog program. Unlike a Datalog materialisation which is in essence a finite set of facts, a DatalogMTL materialisation has to be represented as a finite set of facts plus periodic intervals indicating how the full materialisation can be constructed through unfolding. To cope with this, our algorithm is equipped with specifically designed operators to efficiently handle such periodic representations of DatalogMTL materialisations.

Traditional RL-based beam selection models require extensive training time and computational resources, particularly when deployed in diverse environments with varying propagation characteristics posing a major challenge for scalability and energy efficiency. To address this, we propose modeling the environment as a point cloud, where each point represents the locations of gNodeBs (gNBs) and surrounding scatterers. By computing the Chamfer distance between point clouds, structurally similar environments can be efficiently identified, enabling the reuse of pre-trained models through transfer learning. This methodology leads to a 16x reduction in training time and computational overhead, directly contributing to energy efficiency. By minimizing the need for retraining in each new deployment, our approach significantly lowers power consumption and supports the development of green and sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wireless systems. Furthermore, it accelerates time-to-deployment, reduces carbon emissions associated with training, and enhances the viability of deploying AI-driven communication systems at the edge.

Although $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals exhibit substantially extended spin coherence times at the `magic' magnetic field, the concomitant weak optical absorption has until now prevented single-photon storage. Here, we overcome this challenge by integrating a noiseless photon echo protocol -- which makes full use of the crystal's natural absorption for photonic storage -- with a universally robust dynamical decoupling sequence incorporating adiabatic pulses to protect nuclear spin coherence, enabling long-lived quantum storage at the `magic' magnetic field. At a storage time of 5.6 s, we achieve a time-bin qubit storage fidelity of 88.0 $\\pm$ 2.1%, surpassing the maximum fidelity attainable via classical strategies.

However, real-world Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are often incomplete, leading to the problem of Incomplete KGQA (IKGQA). A common solution is to incorporate external data to fill knowledge gaps, but existing methods lack the capacity to adaptively and contextually fuse multiple sources, failing to fully exploit their complementary strengths. To this end, we propose Debate over Mixed-knowledge (DoM), a novel framework that enables dynamic integration of structured and unstructured knowledge for IKGQA. Built upon the Multi-Agent Debate paradigm, DoM assigns specialized agents to perform inference over knowledge graphs and external texts separately, and coordinates their outputs through iterative interaction. It decomposes the input question into sub-questions, retrieves evidence via dual agents (KG and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG), and employs a judge agent to evaluate and aggregate intermediate answers. This collaboration exploits knowledge complementarity and enhances robustness to KG incompleteness. In addition, existing IKGQA datasets simulate incompleteness by randomly removing triples, failing to capture the irregular and unpredictable nature of real-world knowledge incompleteness. To address this, we introduce a new dataset, Incomplete Knowledge Graph WebQuestions, constructed by leveraging real-world knowledge updates. These updates reflect knowledge beyond the static scope of KGs, yielding a more realistic and challenging benchmark. Through extensive experiments, we show that DoM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines."}

Consequently, the quality of time series data is crucial to TSFM performance, rendering an accurate and efficient data valuation of time series for TSFMs indispensable. However, traditional data valuation methods, such as influence functions, face severe computational bottlenecks due to their poor scalability with growing TSFM model sizes and often fail to preserve temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose LTSV, a Lightweight Time Series Valuation on TSFMS via in-context finetuning. Grounded in the theoretical evidence that in-context finetuning approximates the influence function, LTSV estimates a sample's contribution by measuring the change in context loss after in-context finetuning, leveraging the strong generalization capabilities of TSFMs to produce robust and transferable data valuations. To capture temporal dependencies, we introduce temporal block aggregation, which integrates per-block influence scores across overlapping time windows. Experiments across multiple time series datasets and models demonstrate that LTSV consistently provides reliable and strong valuation performance, while maintaining manageable computational requirements. Our results suggest that in-context finetuning on time series foundation models provides a practical and effective bridge between data attribution and model generalization in time series learning."}

While early approaches primarily focus on one-hop pairwise relationships, recent studies attempt to capture high-order interactions by stacking multiple Graph Neural Network (GNN) layers. However, these approaches face a fundamental trade-off: insufficient layers may lead to under-reaching problems that limit the model's receptive field, while excessive depth can result in prohibitive computational costs. We argue that an effective model should be capable of adaptively modeling both explicit one-hop interactions and implicit high-order dependencies, rather than relying solely on architectural depth. To this end, we propose ViTE (Virtual graph Trajectory Expert router), a novel framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. ViTE consists of two key modules: a Virtual Graph that introduces dynamic virtual nodes to model long-range and high-order interactions without deep GNN stacks, and an Expert Router that adaptively selects interaction experts based on social context using a Mixture-of-Experts design. This combination enables flexible and scalable reasoning across varying interaction patterns.

By combining voltage-dependent photoluminescence, real-time charge-state monitoring, laser-power saturation with spectral decomposition, and time-resolved measurements, we reveal that electric fields several micrometers from the contacts significantly increase the NV- population and enhance spin readout. At low excitation powers, the NV- population evolves on minute timescales following compressed-exponential kinetics, consistent with slow space-charge rearrangement in ultra-insulating diamond. Under pulsed excitation, we observe hundreds-of-nanoseconds NV-/NV0 conversion driven by hole capture, which is strongly suppressed by applied bias.

We attribute this bottleneck to the agents' excessive reliance on static, internal knowledge within MLLMs, which leads to two critical failure points: 1) strategic hallucinations in high-level planning and 2) operational errors during low-level execution on user interfaces (UI). The core insight of this paper is that high-level planning and low-level UI operations require fundamentally distinct types of knowledge. Planning demands high-level, strategy-oriented experiences, whereas operations necessitate low-level, precise instructions closely tied to specific app UIs. Motivated by these insights, we propose Mobile-Agent-RAG, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that innovatively integrates dual-level retrieval augmentation. At the planning stage, we introduce Manager-RAG to reduce strategic hallucinations by retrieving human-validated comprehensive task plans that provide high-level guidance. At the execution stage, we develop Operator-RAG to improve execution accuracy by retrieving the most precise low-level guidance for accurate atomic actions, aligned with the current app and subtask. To accurately deliver these knowledge types, we construct two specialized retrieval-oriented knowledge bases. Furthermore, we introduce Mobile-Eval-RAG, a challenging benchmark for evaluating such agents on realistic multi-app, long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-RAG significantly outperforms SoTA baselines, improving task completion rate by 11.0% and step efficiency by 10.2%, establishing a robust paradigm for context-aware, reliable multi-agent mobile automation."}

This suggests HDC is exceptionally well-suited for a quantum-native implementation. We establish a direct, resource-efficient mapping: (i) hypervectors are mapped to quantum states, (ii) the bundling operation is implemented as a quantum-native averaging process using a Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and Oblivious Amplitude Amplification (OAA), (iii) the binding operation is realized via quantum phase oracles, (iv) the permutation operation is implemented using the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), and (v) vector similarity is calculated using quantum state fidelity measurements based on the Hadamard Test. We present the first-ever implementation of this framework, validated through symbolic analogical reasoning and supervised classification tasks. The viability of QHDC is rigorously assessed via a comparative analysis of results from classical computation, ideal quantum simulation, and execution of a 156-qubit IBM Heron r3 quantum processor. Our results validate the proposed mappings and demonstrate the versatility of the framework, establishing QHDC as a physically realizable technology.

Our learning approach employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with composite rewards that simultaneously optimize decision alignment and framework-specific reasoning processes to facilitate learning of the underlying moral frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate successful generalization to unseen moral scenarios, with softmax-normalized alignment scores improving by +0.757 for utilitarian and +0.450 for deontological frameworks when tested on out-of-distribution evaluation sets.

In this paper, we revisit the challenge of extreme LLM compression -- targeting ultra-low-bit quantization for both activations and weights -- from a Fourier frequency domain perspective. We propose SpecQuant, a two-stage framework that tackles activation outliers and cross-channel variance. In the first stage, activation outliers are smoothed and transferred into the weight matrix to simplify downstream quantization. In the second stage, we apply channel-wise low-frequency Fourier truncation to suppress high-frequency components while preserving essential signal energy, improving quantization robustness. Our method builds on the principle that most of the weight energy is concentrated in low-frequency components, which can be retained with minimal impact on model accuracy. To enable runtime adaptability, we introduce a lightweight truncation module during inference that adjusts truncation thresholds based on channel characteristics. On LLaMA-3 8B, SpecQuant achieves 4-bit quantization for both weights and activations, narrowing the zero-shot accuracy gap to only 1.5% compared to full precision, while delivering 2 times faster inference and 3times lower memory usage."}

Despite the importance of moment operators, their properties have not been as explored for quantum channels. In this work we develop a theoretical framework to compute moment operators for ensembles of quantum channels, for all moment orders $t$, with a special focus on determining ensembles that can be used as points of reference. By deriving hierarchies between ensembles, via inequalities of their moment operator norms, we give them operational meaning, and define useful concepts such as that of channel $t$-designs. Finally, we perform theoretical and numerical studies which show that different types of noise can decrease the norm of the moment operators (e.g., depolarizing noise), as well as increase it (e.g., amplitude damping), and generalize noise-induced concentration phenomena to channel-design-induced phenomena.

While recent work has sought to extend RoPE to higher-dimensional inputs, many such extensions are non-commutative, thereby forfeiting RoPE's shift-equivariance property. Spherical RoPE is one such non-commutative variant, motivated by the idea of rotating embedding vectors on spheres rather than circles. However, spherical rotations are inherently non-commutative, making the choice of rotation sequence ambiguous. In this work, we explore a quaternion-based approach -- Quaternion Rotary Embeddings (QuatRo) -- in place of Euler angles, leveraging quaternions' ability to represent 3D rotations to parameterize the axes of rotation. We show Mixed RoPE and Spherical RoPE to be special cases of QuatRo. Further, we propose a generalization of QuatRo to Clifford Algebraic Rotary Embeddings (CARE) using geometric algebra. Viewing quaternions as the even subalgebra of Cl(3,0,0), we extend the notion of rotary embeddings from quaternions to Clifford rotors acting on multivectors. This formulation enables two key generalizations: (1) extending rotary embeddings to arbitrary dimensions, and (2) encoding positional information in multivectors of multiple grades, not just vectors. We present preliminary experiments comparing spherical, quaternion, and Clifford-based rotary embeddings."}

Accepted at the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)", "summary": "Despite the explosive growth of AI and the technologies built upon it, predicting and inferring the sub-optimal behavior of users or human collaborators remains a critical challenge. In many cases, such behaviors are not a result of irrationality, but rather a rational decision made given inherent cognitive bounds and biased beliefs about the world. In this paper, we formally introduce a class of computational-rational (CR) user models for cognitively-bounded agents acting optimally under biased beliefs. The key novelty lies in explicitly modeling how a bounded memory process leads to a dynamically inconsistent and biased belief state and, consequently, sub-optimal sequential decision-making. We address the challenge of identifying the latent user-specific bound and inferring biased belief states from passive observations on the fly. We argue that for our formalized CR model family with an explicit and parameterized cognitive process, this challenge is tractable. To support our claim, we propose an efficient online inference method based on nested particle filtering that simultaneously tracks the user's latent belief state and estimates the unknown cognitive bound from a stream of observed actions. We validate our approach in a representative navigation task using memory decay as an example of a cognitive bound. With simulations, we show that (1) our CR model generates intuitively plausible behaviors corresponding to different levels of memory capacity, and (2) our inference method accurately and efficiently recovers the ground-truth cognitive bounds from limited observations ($\\le 100$ steps). We further demonstrate how this approach provides a principled foundation for developing adaptive AI assistants, enabling adaptive assistance that accounts for the user's memory limitations."}

In this work, we build on the recently proposed `SamAdams' framework for timestep adaptation (Leimkuhler, Lohmann, and Whalley 2025), introducing an adaptive scheme: SA-SGLD, which employs time rescaling to modulate the stepsize according to a monitored quantity (typically the local gradient norm). SA-SGLD can automatically shrink stepsizes in regions of high curvature and expand them in flatter regions, improving both stability and mixing without introducing bias. We show that our method can achieve more accurate posterior sampling than SGLD on high-curvature 2D toy examples and in image classification with BNNs using sharp priors."}

To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge Density-Guided Unlearning via Blocks Reinsertion (KUnBR), a novel approach that first identifies layers with rich harmful knowledge and then thoroughly eliminates the harmful knowledge via re-insertion strategy.

This operation induces a relative shift in phase across positions, allowing the model to compute attention as a function of positional differences rather than absolute indices. We show this simple method significantly outperforms traditional absolute positional embeddings and is comparable to RoPE. We derive a continuous case of RollPE which implicitly imposes a topographic structure on the query and key space. We further derive a mathematical equivalence of RollPE to a particular configuration of RoPE.

While they can produce reasoning-like content via methods such as chain-of-thought prompting, these outputs are typically unstructured and informal, obscuring whether models truly understand the fundamental reasoning paradigms that underpin scientific inference. To address this, we introduce a novel task named Latent Reasoning Chain Extraction (ARCHE), in which models must decompose complex reasoning arguments into combinations of standard reasoning paradigms in the form of a Reasoning Logic Tree (RLT). In RLT, all reasoning steps are explicitly categorized as one of three variants of Peirce's fundamental inference modes: deduction, induction, or abduction. To facilitate this task, we release ARCHE Bench, a new benchmark derived from 70 Nature Communications articles, including more than 1,900 references and 38,000 viewpoints. We propose two logic-aware evaluation metrics: Entity Coverage (EC) for content completeness and Reasoning Edge Accuracy (REA) for step-by-step logical validity. Evaluations on 10 leading LLMs on ARCHE Bench reveal that models exhibit a trade-off between REA and EC, and none are yet able to extract a complete and standard reasoning chain. These findings highlight a substantial gap between the abilities of current reasoning models and the rigor required for scientific argumentation."}

Instead, it presents a conceptual prototype-an architectural framework that opens up a new direction for exploring adaptable and potentially more interpretable networks. The goal is not optimization of existing benchmarks but rather the proposal of a system that can learn not only representations, but also the structure of computation itself.\n  Due to practical constraints in computing resources and data, this study remains a preliminary investigation.

The parameter $ε>0$ assigned at the bridge represents the strength of connectivity: if $ε=0$, then the graph is completely separated. We show that for sufficiently small values of $ε$, a phenomenon called pulsation occurs. The pulsation is characterized by the periodic transfer of the quantum walker between the two graphs. An asymptotic expression with respect to small $ε$ for the probability of finding the walker on either of the two graphs is derived. This expression reveals that the pulsation depends solely on the number of edges in each graph, regardless of their structure. In addition, we obtain that the quantum walker is transferred periodically between the two graphs, with a period of order $O(ε^{-1/2})$. Furthermore, when the number of edges of two graphs is equal, the quantum walker is almost completely transferred."}

To this end, we propose PCRS-TKA, a prompt-based framework employing retrieval-augmented generation to integrate PLMs with KGs. PCRS-TKA constructs dialogue-specific knowledge trees from KGs and serializes them into texts, enabling structure-aware reasoning while capturing rich entity semantics. Our approach selectively filters context-relevant knowledge and explicitly models collaborative preferences using specialized supervision signals. A semantic alignment module harmonizes heterogeneous inputs, reducing noise and enhancing accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCRS-TKA consistently outperforms all baselines in both recommendation and conversational quality."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose a bidirectional pruning-regrowth strategy. Starting from an extremely compressed network that satisfies hardware constraints, the method selectively regenerates critical connections to recover lost performance, effectively mitigating the sharp accuracy drop commonly observed under high sparsity conditions."}

However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy."}

In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces, where identifying partner behaviors and selecting suitable responses is difficult. In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space. Through these experiments and an online user study, we demonstrate that our proposed agent achieves state of the art performance compared to existing baselines when paired with novel human, and agent teammates."}

For instance, after learning to detect traffic signs, a model may later need to learn to classify traffic lights or different types of vehicles using the same camera feed. This scenario introduces a challenging setting we term Continual Multitask Learning (CMTL), where a model sequentially learns new tasks on an underlying data distribution without forgetting previously learned abilities. Existing continual learning methods often fail in this setting because they learn fragmented, task-specific features that interfere with one another. To address this, we introduce Learning with Preserving (LwP), a novel framework that shifts the focus from preserving task outputs to maintaining the geometric structure of the shared representation space. The core of LwP is a Dynamically Weighted Distance Preservation (DWDP) loss that prevents representation drift by regularizing the pairwise distances between latent data representations. This mechanism of preserving the underlying geometric structure allows the model to retain implicit knowledge and support diverse tasks without requiring a replay buffer, making it suitable for privacy-conscious applications. Extensive evaluations on time-series and image benchmarks show that LwP not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CMTL tasks. Notably, our method shows superior robustness to distribution shifts and is the only approach to surpass the strong single-task learning baseline, underscoring its effectiveness for real-world dynamic environments."}

Optimal foraging means following the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), in which individuals exploit a patch of semantically related concepts until it becomes less rewarding and then switch to a new cluster. While human behavioral data suggests foraging-like patterns in semantic fluency tasks, it remains unclear whether modern high-dimensional embedding spaces provide representations that allow algorithms to match observed human behavior. Using state-of-the-art embeddings and prior semantic fluency data, I find that random walks on these embedding spaces produce results consistent with optimal foraging and the MVT. Surprisingly, introducing Metropolis-Hastings sampling, an adaptive algorithm expected to model strategic acceptance and rejection of new clusters, does not produce results consistent with human behavior. These findings challenge the assumption that more complex sampling mechanisms inherently lead to better cognitive models of memory retrieval. Instead, they show that appropriately structured embeddings, even with simple sampling, can produce near-optimal foraging dynamics. This supports the perspective of Hills (2012) rather than Abbott (2015), demonstrating that modern embeddings can approximate human memory foraging without relying on complex acceptance criteria."}

We evaluate the proposed method on standard IEEE AC-OPF benchmarks and show that homotopy-guided L2O significantly increases feasibility rates compared to non-homotopy baselines, while achieving objective values comparable to full OPF solvers.

The Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) equation uniquely characterizes Markovian dynamics that are completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP), yet many physical systems display non-Markovian features such as algebraic relaxation and coherence backflow beyond the reach of semigroup evolution. Fractional calculus provides a natural framework for describing such long-memory behavior through power-law temporal kernels introduced by fractional time derivatives. Here we establish a unified hierarchy that embeds fractional quantum master equations within the broader landscape of open system dynamics. The fractional master equation forms a structured subclass of memory-kernel models, reducing to the GKSL form at unit fractional order. Through Bochner--Phillips subordination, fractional evolution is expressed as an average over Lindblad semigroups weighted by a power-law waiting-time distribution. This construction ensures physical consistency, explains the algebraic origin of long-time decay, and bridges unitary, Markovian, and structured non-Markovian regimes. The resulting framework positions fractional calculus as a rigorous and unifying language for quantum dynamics with intrinsic memory, enabling new directions for theoretical analysis and quantum simulation."}

In contrast, temporal split validation showed enhanced generalization, especially for forests (ROC-AUC = 0.6615, PR-AUC = 0.8423). SHAP-based XAI analysis identified key ecosystem-specific drivers: soil organic carbon, tree cover, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) emerged as the most influential in forests, whereas Land Surface Temperature (LST), elevation, and vegetation health indices were dominant in grasslands. District-level classification revealed that Central Valley and Northern Buttes districts had the highest concentration of high-risk grasslands, while Northern Buttes and North Coast Redwoods dominated forested high-risk areas. This RF-SHAP framework offers a robust, comprehensible, and adaptable method for assessing wildfire risks, enabling informed decisions and creating targeted strategies to mitigate dangers."}

The interplay between lattice topology and non-Hermiticity gives rise to both bulk and edge exceptional points (EPs), which govern the charging dynamics. In the topological regime, an edge-state EP emerges at an exponentially small non-Hermitian strength, resulting in early PT-symmetry breaking and rapid energy accumulation. This topological enhancement originates from the PT-symmetric non-Hermitian dynamics, in which the broken-symmetry edge mode with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue dominates the time evolution. Consequently, the topological phase consistently yields higher stored energy and faster saturation than the trivial configuration across all parameter regimes and system sizes. These findings demonstrate that topology constitutes a genuine physical resource for enhancing the performance of quantum batteries."}

Current deep learning approaches primarily focus on encoder-decoder architectural refinements. However, existing methodologies exhibit several limitations:(1)they rely on dilated convolutions for multi-scale context extraction, lacking the partial feature effectiveness and interoperability of inter-channel;(2)attention-based feature enhancement implementations neglect accuracy-throughput balance; and (3)the decoder modifications fail to establish global interdependencies among hierarchical local features, limiting inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose MPCM-Net, a Multi-scale network that integrates Partial attention Convolutions with Mamba architectures to enhance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, the encoder incorporates MPAC, which comprises:(1)a MPC block with ParCM and ParSM that enables global spatial interaction across multi-scale cloud formations, and (2)a MPA block combining ParAM and ParSM to extract discriminative features with reduced computational complexity. On the decoder side, a M2B is employed to mitigate contextual loss through a SSHD that maintains linear complexity while enabling deep feature aggregation across spatial and scale dimensions. As a key contribution to the community, we also introduce and release a dataset CSRC, which is a clear-label, fine-grained segmentation benchmark designed to overcome the critical limitations of existing public datasets. Extensive experiments on CSRC demonstrate the superior performance of MPCM-Net over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and inference speed.

For example, an oncologist may first conduct a breast exam, followed by a mammogram for patients with concerning exams, followed by a biopsy for patients with concerning mammograms. A key challenge is that the ground truth outcome, such as the biopsy result, is only revealed at the end of this funnel. The selective censoring of the ground truth can introduce statistical biases in risk estimation, especially in underserved patient groups, whose outcomes are more frequently censored. We develop a Bayesian model for funnel decision structures, drawing from prior work on selective labels and censoring. We first show in synthetic settings that our model is able to recover the true parameters and predict outcomes for censored patients more accurately than baselines. We then apply our model to a dataset of emergency department visits, where in-hospital mortality is observed only for those who are admitted to either the hospital or ICU. We find that there are gender-based differences in hospital and ICU admissions. In particular, our model estimates that the mortality risk threshold to admit women to the ICU is higher for women (5.1%) than for men (4.5%)."}

A key hurdle lies in accessing the original training data, as fine-tuning solely on new data often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose Replay Tuning (R-Tuning), a novel framework designed for the continual adaptation of pre-trained time-series models. R-Tuning constructs a unified latent space that captures both prior and current task knowledge through a frequency-aware replay strategy. Specifically, it augments model-generated samples via wavelet-based decomposition across multiple frequency bands, generating trend-preserving and fusion-enhanced variants to improve representation diversity and replay efficiency. To further reduce reliance on synthetic samples, R-Tuning introduces a latent consistency constraint that aligns new representations with the prior task space. This constraint guides joint optimization within a compact and semantically coherent latent space, ensuring robust knowledge retention and adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of R-Tuning, which reduces MAE and MSE by up to 46.9% and 46.8%, respectively, on new tasks, while preserving prior knowledge with gains of up to 5.7% and 6.0% on old tasks. Notably, under few-shot settings, R-Tuning outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines even when synthetic proxy samples account for only 5% of the new task dataset."}

A powerful training-free strategy to accelerate this process is Schedule Optimization, which aims to find an optimal distribution of timesteps for a fixed and small Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) to maximize sample quality. To this end, a successful schedule optimization method must adhere to four core principles: effectiveness, adaptivity, practical robustness, and computational efficiency. However, existing paradigms struggle to satisfy these principles simultaneously, motivating the need for a more advanced solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical-Schedule-Optimizer (HSO), a novel and efficient bi-level optimization framework. HSO reframes the search for a globally optimal schedule into a more tractable problem by iteratively alternating between two synergistic levels: an upper-level global search for an optimal initialization strategy and a lower-level local optimization for schedule refinement. This process is guided by two key innovations: the Midpoint Error Proxy (MEP), a solver-agnostic and numerically stable objective for effective local optimization, and the Spacing-Penalized Fitness (SPF) function, which ensures practical robustness by penalizing pathologically close timesteps. Extensive experiments show that HSO sets a new state-of-the-art for training-free sampling in the extremely low-NFE regime. For instance, with an NFE of just 5, HSO achieves a remarkable FID of 11.94 on LAION-Aesthetics with Stable Diffusion v2.1. Crucially, this level of performance is attained not through costly retraining, but with a one-time optimization cost of less than 8 seconds, presenting a highly practical and efficient paradigm for diffusion model acceleration."}

However, tuning the learnable prompts solely based on unlabeled test data may induce prompt optimization bias, ultimately leading to suboptimal performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we analyze the underlying causes of prompt optimization bias from both the model and data perspectives. In terms of the model, the entropy minimization objective typically focuses on reducing the entropy of model predictions while overlooking their correctness. This can result in overconfident yet incorrect outputs, thereby compromising the quality of prompt optimization. On the data side, prompts affected by optimization bias can introduce misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which further aggravates the prompt optimization bias. To this end, we propose a Doubly Debiased Test-Time Prompt Tuning method. Specifically, we first introduce a dynamic retrieval-augmented modulation module that retrieves high-confidence knowledge from a dynamic knowledge base using the test image feature as a query, and uses the retrieved knowledge to modulate the predictions. Guided by the refined predictions, we further develop a reliability-aware prompt optimization module that incorporates a confidence-based weighted ensemble and cross-modal consistency distillation to impose regularization constraints during prompt tuning. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmark datasets involving both natural distribution shifts and cross-datasets generalization demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, validating its effectiveness in mitigating prompt optimization bias."}

While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable promise in multimodal reasoning, their application to complex human-computer interaction scenarios--such as strategy gaming--remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization. Beyond providing an efficient solution for strategy game automation, our work establishes a general paradigm for enhancing VLM performance through structured multimodal data organization, offering new insights into the interplay between static perception and dynamic reasoning in embodied intelligence."}

This system exhibits quantum bistability and supports a logical manifold for a bosonic qubit. Using Kramer's theory together with the $P$-representation, we derive an analytical expression for the bit-flip error rate within the potential-barrier approximation. The agreement is demonstrated between analytical calculations and numerical simulations obtained by diagonalization of the Liouvillian superoperator. In the purely dissipative limit, the switching rate increases monotonically with detuning, as the two metastable states approach each other in phase space. However, the exponential contribution to the bit-flip rate exhibits a nontrivial dependence on system parameters, extending beyond the naive scaling with the average photon number. In the presence of large Kerr nonlinearity, the switching rate becomes a nonmonotonic function of the detuning and reaches a minimum at a finite detuning. This effect arises because detuning lowers the activation barrier for weak nonlinearity but increases it for large ones, ensuring a minimum of the switching-rate at nonzero detuning. These results establish key conditions for optimizing the performance of critical cat qubits and are directly relevant for the design of scalable superconducting bosonic quantum architectures."}

This work shows that ignoring source dynamics yields inconsistent trajectories that suppress or merge semantic cues, leading to \"semantic over-smoothing\" artifacts. As such, we reformulate text-to-3D optimization as mapping a dynamically evolving source distribution to a fixed target distribution. We cast the problem into a dual-conditioned latent space, conditioned on both the text prompt and the intermediately rendered image. Given this joint setup, we observe that the image condition naturally anchors the current source distribution. Building on this insight, we introduce AnchorDS, an improved score distillation mechanism that provides state-anchored guidance with image conditions and stabilizes generation. We further penalize erroneous source estimates and design a lightweight filter strategy and fine-tuning strategy that refines the anchor with negligible overhead. AnchorDS produces finer-grained detail, more natural colours, and stronger semantic consistency, particularly for complex prompts, while maintaining efficiency.

To accelerate this process for experimentalists, we implement Qalibrate, a fast, JAX-enabled simulator that generates pulses given target unitaries. Specifically, we generate a propagator that models the time evolution of three-electron spin qubits and integrate our gradient-based optimizer to generate the pulses. The simulation involves solving the Lindblad master equation, which we parallelize by employing an approximation of the time evolution called the Magnus expansion.

However, current agents struggle with repetitive errors and lack the ability to learn from past experiences across sessions, limiting their long-term robustness and sample efficiency. We introduce WebCoach, a model-agnostic self-evolving framework that equips web browsing agents with persistent cross-session memory, enabling improved long-term planning, reflection, and continual learning without retraining. WebCoach consists of three key components: (1) a WebCondenser, which standardizes raw navigation logs into concise summaries; (2) an External Memory Store, which organizes complete trajectories as episodic experiences; and (3) a Coach, which retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity and recency, and decides whether to inject task-specific advice into the agent via runtime hooks. This design empowers web agents to access long-term memory beyond their native context window, improving robustness in complex browsing tasks. Moreover, WebCoach achieves self-evolution by continuously curating episodic memory from new navigation trajectories, enabling agents to improve over time without retraining. Evaluations on the WebVoyager benchmark demonstrate that WebCoach consistently improves the performance of browser-use agents across three different LLM backbones. With a 38B model, it increases task success rates from 47% to 61% while reducing or maintaining the average number of steps. Notably, smaller base models with WebCoach achieve performance comparable to the same web agent using GPT-4o."}

These exact recurrences were found to be independent of $k_θ$. The long-time-averaged entanglement and fidelity rate function show dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) for $k_r = jπ/2$ at time-reversal symmetric cases $k_θ= \\pm k_r$. In the other time-reversal symmetric case $k_θ= 0$, the DQPT exists only for a half-odd integer $j$. Using level statistics, a smooth transition is observed from integrable to non-integrable nature as $k_r$ is changed away from $jπ/2$.

However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data."}

In this work, we evaluate the ability of LMs to encode and update their internal world model in dyadic conversations and test their malleability under linguistic alterations. To facilitate this, we apply seven minimal linguistic alterations to conversations sourced from popular datasets and construct two benchmarks comprising yes-no questions. We evaluate a wide range of open and closed source LMs and observe that they struggle to maintain robust accuracy. Our analysis unveils that LMs struggle to memorize crucial details, such as tracking entities under linguistic alterations to conversations. We then propose a dual-perspective interpretability framework which identifies transformer layers that are useful or harmful and highlights linguistic alterations most influenced by harmful layers, typically due to encoding spurious signals or relying on shortcuts. Inspired by these insights, we propose two layer-regularization based fine-tuning strategies that suppress the effect of the harmful layers."}

To address this, we evaluate both proof-based and final-answer reasoning to obtain a more reliable measure of model performance. We then scale two major generative verification methods (GenSelect and LLM-as-a-Judge) to millions of tokens and identify their combination as the most effective framework for solution verification and selection.

This work presents a framework for probabilistic electricity price forecasting using Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, training separate models for each hour of the day to capture diurnal patterns. A critical assessment and comparison with the benchmark model, namely: generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity with exogenous variable (GARCHX) model and the LASSO estimated auto-regressive model (LEAR), highlights that the proposed model outperforms the benchmark models in terms of point prediction and intervals.

However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus\" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing."}

A common solution is trajectory-level optimization, which treats each trajectory as a single training sample. However, this approach can be inefficient and yield misleading learning signals: it applies uniform sampling across tasks regardless of difficulty, penalizes correct intermediate actions in failed trajectories, and incurs high sample-collection costs. To address these issues, we propose STEP (Success-rate-aware Trajectory-Efficient Policy optimization), a framework that dynamically allocates sampling based on per-task success rates and performs step-level optimization. STEP maintains a smoothed success-rate record to guide adaptive trajectory resampling, allocating more effort to harder tasks. It then computes success-rate-weighted advantages and decomposes trajectories into step-level samples. Finally, it applies a step-level GRPO augmentation to refine updates for low-success tasks. Experiments on OSWorld and AndroidWorld show that STEP substantially improves sample efficiency and training stability over trajectory-level GRPO, converging faster and generalizing better under the same sampling budget."}

Experiments were conducted in deathmatches of ViZDoom, utilizing perfect segmentation results for controlled evaluation. Our results showed that SS-only was able to reduce the memory consumption of memory buffers by at least 66.6%, and up to 98.6% when a vectorisable lossless compression technique with minimal overhead such as run-length encoding is applied.

In this work, we investigate parameter estimation for Gaussian states, in which the probe-state preparation stage involves two noncommutative Gaussian measurements on the position and momentum observables, introducing tunable parameters. The influence of these noncommutative Gaussian measurements is investigated through the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We showed that the QFI for characterizing Gaussian channels can be increased by adjusting the uncertainty parameters in the preparation of the probe state. Furthermore, if the probe is initially in a thermal state, probe-state preparation may generate quantum coherence in its energy basis. We showed that not only does the amount of coherence affect the improvement of the QFI, but also the rate of change of the coherence with respect to the parameter to be estimated. The proposed probe-state protocol is applied to two paradigmatic single-mode Gaussian channels, the attenuator and amplification channels, which are building blocks of Gaussian quantum information. Our results contribute to the use of coherence in quantum metrology and are experimentally feasible in quantum-optical devices."}

These models produce embeddings that can be used as analysis-ready datasets, enabling the modelling of ecosystem dynamics without extensive sensor-specific preprocessing. However, existing models typically operate at fixed spatial or temporal scales, limiting their use for ecological analyses that require both fine spatial detail and high temporal fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a representation learning framework that integrates different EO modalities into a unified feature space at high spatio-temporal resolution. We introduce the framework using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as representative modalities. Our approach produces a latent space at native 10 m resolution and the temporal frequency of cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisitions. Each sensor is first modeled independently to capture its sensor-specific characteristics. Their representations are then combined into a shared model. This two-stage design enables modality-specific optimisation and easy extension to new sensors, retaining pretrained encoders while retraining only fusion layers. This enables the model to capture complementary remote sensing data and to preserve coherence across space and time. Qualitative analyses reveal that the learned embeddings exhibit high spatial and semantic consistency across heterogeneous landscapes. Quantitative evaluation in modelling Gross Primary Production reveals that they encode ecologically meaningful patterns and retain sufficient temporal fidelity to support fine-scale analyses. Overall, the proposed framework provides a flexible, analysis-ready representation learning approach for environmental applications requiring diverse spatial and temporal resolutions."}

We argue that \"free\" communication, by ignoring the principle of scarcity, inherently breeds inefficiency and unnecessary expenses. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Auction-based Language Agent (DALA), a novel framework that treats communication bandwidth as a scarce and tradable resource. Specifically, our DALA regards inter-agent communication as a centralized auction, where agents learn to bid for the opportunity to speak based on the predicted value density of their messages. Thus, our DALA intrinsically encourages agents to produce concise, informative messages while filtering out low-value communication. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our economically-driven DALA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging reasoning benchmarks, including 84.32% on MMLU and a 91.21% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. Note that this is accomplished with remarkable efficiency, i.e., our DALA uses only 6.25 million tokens, a fraction of the resources consumed by current state-of-the-art methods on GSM8K. Further analysis reveals that our DALA cultivates the emergent skill of strategic silence, effectively adapting its communication strategies from verbosity to silence in a dynamical manner via resource constraints."}

Inspired by memory consolidation in neuroscience, we propose FSC-Net (Fast-Slow Consolidation Networks), a dual-network architecture that separates rapid task learning from gradual knowledge consolidation. Our method employs a fast network (NN1) for immediate adaptation to new tasks and a slow network (NN2) that consolidates knowledge through distillation and replay. Within the family of MLP-based NN1 variants we evaluated, consolidation effectiveness is driven more by methodology than architectural embellishments -- a simple MLP outperforms more complex similarity-gated variants by 1.2pp. Through systematic hyperparameter analysis, we observed empirically that pure replay without distillation during consolidation achieves superior performance, consistent with the hypothesis that distillation from the fast network introduces recency bias. On Split-MNIST (30 seeds), FSC-Net achieves 91.71% +/- 0.62% retention accuracy, a +4.27pp gain over the fast network alone (87.43% +/- 1.27%, paired t=23.585, p < 1e-10).

We prove that, under local energy relaxation and dephasing noise, MDD achieves the maximum entanglement fidelity attainable by any DD scheme based on bang-bang operations to first order in evolution time. On the IBM Eagle processor, MDD achieved up to a $450$-fold improvement in the success probability of a $14$-qubit quantum Fourier transform, and improved the accuracy of ground-state energy estimation for $N_2$ in the $56$-qubit sample-based quantum diagonalization compared with the standard XX-pulse DD. These results establish MDD as a scalable and effective approach for suppressing decoherence in large-scale quantum algorithms."}

However, the lack of training in specialized areas hinders their accuracy. Current training methods train a unified large language model (LLM) for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, training multi-agent systems with distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization designed for vertical Multi-agent systems with a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaining hierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces a trajectory-alignment scheme that generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy a decoupled training pipeline in which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via a shared store. This enables scalable training without cross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency. These results show that aligning heterogeneous trajectories and decoupling optimization across specialized agents enhances tool-augmented reasoning tasks."}

Although artificial intelligence (AI) substantially improves CXR-based detection, development is hindered by globally distributed data, high inter-hospital variability, and strict privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that make centralization impractical. These constraints are compounded by heterogeneous imaging protocols, uneven data availability, and the costs of transferring large medical images across geographically dispersed sites.\n  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, enabling multiple hospitals (nodes) to collaboratively train a CXR classifier for pneumonia while keeping data in place and private. Using the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset, we simulate cross-hospital collaboration with non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, reproducing real-world variability across institutions and jurisdictions. Our experiments demonstrate that collaborative and privacy-preserving training across multiple hospitals via FL led to a dramatic performance improvement achieving 0.900 Accuracy and 0.966 ROC-AUC, corresponding to 47.5% and 50.0% gains over single-hospital models (0.610; 0.644), without transferring any patient CXR.

When a BB code has a Tanner graph that is a $h$-fold covering of the base BB code's Tanner graph, we refer to it as a $h$-cover code. We show that for a BB code to be a $h$-cover code, its lattice parameters and defining polynomials must satisfy simple algebraic conditions relative to those of the base code. By extending the graph covering map to a chain map, we show there are induced projection and lifting maps on (co)homology that enable the projection and lifting of logical operators and, in certain cases, automorphisms between the base and the cover code. The search space of cover codes is considerably reduced compared to the full space of possible polynomials and we find that many interesting examples of BB codes, such as the $[[144,12,12]]$ gross code, can be viewed as cover codes. We also apply our method to search for BB codes with weight 8 checks and find many codes, including a $[[64,14,8]]$ and $[[144,14,14]]$ code.

Recent studies have confirmed the overly confident tendencies of machine-generated responses, particularly in large language models (LLMs). As these systems are increasingly embedded in ethical decision-making scenarios, it is important to understand their moral reasoning and the inherent uncertainties in building reliable AI systems. This work examines how uncertainty influences moral decisions in the classical trolley problem, analyzing responses from 32 open-source models and 9 distinct moral dimensions. We first find that variance in model confidence is greater across models than within moral dimensions, suggesting that moral uncertainty is predominantly shaped by model architecture and training method. To quantify uncertainty, we measure binary entropy as a linear combination of total entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information. To examine its effects, we introduce stochasticity into models via \"dropout\" at inference time. Our findings show that our mechanism increases total entropy, mainly through a rise in mutual information, while conditional entropy remains largely unchanged. Moreover, this mechanism significantly improves human-LLM moral alignment, with correlations in mutual information and alignment score shifts. Our results highlight the potential to better align model-generated decisions and human preferences by deliberately modulating uncertainty and reducing LLMs' confidence in morally complex scenarios."}

By generating embeddings under multiple representation scales, the framework combines their features from different geometric views into a unified Grassmann manifold.

Bolstered by growing reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to enhance healthcare predictions by drawing on their rich parametric knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to factual inaccuracies due to limitations in the reliability and coverage of their embedded knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, such as GraphRAG and its variants, have been proposed to mitigate these issues by incorporating external knowledge, they face two key challenges in the healthcare scenario: (1) identifying the clinical necessity to activate the retrieval mechanism, and (2) achieving synergy between the retriever and the generator to craft contextually appropriate retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose GHAR, a \\underline{g}enerative \\underline{h}ierarchical \\underline{a}gentic \\underline{R}AG framework that simultaneously resolves when to retrieve and how to optimize the collaboration between submodules in healthcare.

Agent-Top acts as the primary physician, iteratively deciding whether to rely on parametric knowledge or to initiate retrieval, while Agent-Low acts as the consulting service, summarising all task-relevant knowledge once retrieval was triggered. To tackle the second challenge, we innovatively unify the optimization of both agents within a formal Markov Decision Process, designing diverse rewards to align their shared goal of accurate prediction while preserving their distinct roles. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets across three popular tasks demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the potential of hierarchical agentic RAG in advancing healthcare systems."}

To address these limitations, we develop a vision-based surrogate modeling framework that operates directly on a 3D voxelized representation of the data center, incorporating server workloads, fan speeds, and HVAC temperature set points. We evaluate multiple architectures, including 3D CNN U-Net variants, a 3D Fourier Neural Operator, and 3D vision transformers, to map these thermal inputs to high-fidelity heat maps. Our results show that the surrogate models generalize across data center configurations and achieve up to 20,000x speedup (hundreds of milliseconds vs. hours).

However, the production of quantum light across multiple frequency combs remains unexplored. In this work, we theoretically explore a mechanism that generates a series of nonlinearly coupled frequency combs through cascaded three-wave upconversion and downconversion processes mediated by a single idler comb. We show how this system generates inter- and intracomb two-mode squeezing and entanglement spanning a very large spectral range, from ultraviolet to mid-IR frequencies.

In addition, we incorporate a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning, which preserves supervised behavior cloning priors while injecting reward-guided improvements. Despite a compact 160M parameter budget, DAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-loop metrics and delivers competitive closed-loop results on the NAVSIM benchmark.

The success of the model is explained by showing that it constitutes a Markov chain, which can be derived from the full master equations. We show that in the many-photon limit, the model simplifies to Langevin equations. We perform an extensive comparison of different approaches for computing quantum noise in lasers, identifying the best approach for different system sizes, ranging from nanolasers to macroscopic lasers, and different levels of excitation, i.e., cavity photon number. In particular, we find that the numerical solution to the Langevin equations is inaccurate below the laser threshold, while the laser Markov chain model, on the other hand, is accurate for all pump values and laser sizes when collective emitter effects are excluded."}

We introduce PhysicsInformed Neural ODEs with with Scale-Aware Residuals (PI-NODE-SR), a framework that combines a low-order explicit solver (Heun method) residual normalisation to balance contributions between state variables evolving on disparate timescales. This combination stabilises training under realistic iteration budgets and avoids reliance on computationally expensive implicit solvers. On the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, PI-NODE-SR learns from a single oscillation simulated with a stiff solver (Rodas5P) and extrapolates beyond 100 ms, capturing both oscillation frequency and near-correct amplitudes. Remarkably, end-to-end learning of the vector field enables PI-NODE-SR to recover morphological features such as sharp subthreshold curvature in gating variables that are typically reserved for higher-order solvers, suggesting that neural correction can offset numerical diffusion.

Type 2 architectures distribute a large error correcting code block across multiple modules, with most stabilizer measurements remaining local, except for a small subset at patch boundaries that are performed using nonlocal CNOT gates.

We investigate this by training GPT-2 models on three spatial learning paradigms in grid environments: passive exploration (Foraging Model- predicting steps in random walks), goal-directed planning (generating optimal shortest paths) on structured Hamiltonian paths (SP-Hamiltonian), and a hybrid model fine-tuned with exploratory data (SP-Random Walk). Using behavioural, representational and mechanistic analyses, we uncover two fundamentally different learned algorithms. The Foraging model develops a robust, map-like representation of space, akin to a 'cognitive map'. Causal interventions reveal that it learns to consolidate spatial information into a self-sufficient coordinate system, evidenced by a sharp phase transition where its reliance on historical direction tokens vanishes by the middle layers of the network. The model also adopts an adaptive, hierarchical reasoning system, switching between a low-level heuristic for short contexts and map-based inference for longer ones. In contrast, the goal-directed models learn a path-dependent algorithm, remaining reliant on explicit directional inputs throughout all layers. The hybrid model, despite demonstrating improved generalisation over its parent, retains the same path-dependent strategy. These findings suggest that the nature of spatial intelligence in transformers may lie on a spectrum, ranging from generalisable world models shaped by exploratory data to heuristics optimised for goal-directed tasks. We provide a mechanistic account of this generalisation-optimisation trade-off and highlight how the choice of training regime influences the strategies that emerge."}

To supply task-faithful data augmentation, we introduce a class-conditional diffusion model that generates KPIs sequences preserving root-cause semantics, and by controlling reverse diffusion steps, it produces weak and strong augmentations that improve intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Finally, the encoder and the lightweight classifier are jointly fine-tuned with scarce expert-verified labels to sharpen decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on a real-world, operator-grade dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, with DK-Root surpassing traditional ML and recent semi-supervised time-series methods. Ablations confirm the necessity of the conditional diffusion augmentation and the pretrain-finetune design, validating both representation quality and classification gains."}

A key component of such architectures is a scheduler that coordinates operations over a short-range quantum network required to enable the necessary non-local entangling gates between quantum processing units (QPUs). It is desirable to determine schedules of minimum make span, which in the case of networks with constrained resources hinges on their efficient usage. Here we compare and contrast two approaches to solving the make span minimization problem, an approach based on the resource constrained project scheduling (RCPSP) framework, and another based on a greedy heuristic algorithm. The workflow considered is as follows. Firstly, the computational circuit is partitioned and assigned to different QPUs such that the number of nonlocal entangling gates acting across partitions is minimized while the qubit load is nearly uniform on the individual QPUs, which can be accomplished using, e.g., the METIS solver. Secondly, the nonlocal entangling gate requirements with respect to the partitions are identified, and mapped to network operation sequences that deliver the necessary entanglement between the QPUs. Finally, the network operations are scheduled such that the make span is minimized. As illustrative examples, we analyze the implementation of a small instance of the Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm over instances of a simple hub and spoke (star) network architecture comprised of a quantum switch as the hub and QPUs as spokes, each with a finite qubit resource budget. In one instance, our results show the RCPSP approach outperforming the greedy heuristic. In another instance, we find the two performing equally well. Our results thus illustrate the effectiveness of the RCPSP framework, while also underlining the relevance and usefulness of greedy heuristics."}

We present a curiosity-driven quantized Mixture-of-Experts framework that addresses both through Bayesian epistemic uncertainty-based routing across heterogeneous experts (BitNet ternary, 1-16 bit BitLinear, post-training quantization). Evaluated on audio classification benchmarks (ESC-50, Quinn, UrbanSound8K), our 4-bit quantization maintains 99.9 percent of 16-bit accuracy (0.858 vs 0.859 F1) with 4x compression and 41 percent energy savings versus 8-bit. Crucially, curiosity-driven routing reduces MoE latency variance by 82 percent (p = 0.008, Levene's test) from 230 ms to 29 ms standard deviation, enabling stable inference for battery-constrained devices. Statistical analysis confirms 4-bit/8-bit achieve practical equivalence with full precision (p > 0.05), while MoE architectures introduce 11 percent latency overhead (p < 0.001) without accuracy gains. At scale, deployment emissions dominate training by 10000x for models serving more than 1,000 inferences, making inference efficiency critical. Our information-theoretic routing demonstrates that adaptive quantization yields accurate (0.858 F1, 1.2M params), energy-efficient (3.87 F1/mJ), and predictable edge models, with simple 4-bit quantized architectures outperforming complex MoE for most deployments."}

However, distribution shifts arising from the complex and dynamic nature of TC environmental fields, such as varying geographical conditions and seasonal changes, present significant challenges to reliable estimation. Most existing methods rely on multi-modal fusion for feature extraction but overlook the intrinsic distribution of feature representations, leading to poor generalization under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this, we propose an effective Identity Distribution-Oriented Physical Invariant Learning framework (IDOL), which imposes identity-oriented constraints to regulate the feature space under the guidance of prior physical knowledge, thereby dealing distribution variability with physical invariance. Specifically, the proposed IDOL employs the wind field model and dark correlation knowledge of TC to model task-shared and task-specific identity tokens. These tokens capture task dependencies and intrinsic physical invariances of TC, enabling robust estimation of TC wind speed, pressure, inner-core, and outer-core size under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and tasks demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed IDOL, verifying that imposing identity-oriented constraints based on prior physical knowledge can effectively mitigates diverse distribution shifts in TC estimation.Code is available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/IDOL."}

While existing fair learning models aim to mitigate bias, achieving an optimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy remains a challenge. Moreover, the reliance on black-box models hinders interpretability, limiting their applicability in socially sensitive domains. In this paper, we try to circumvent these issues by integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within a fair adversarial learning framework. Leveraging the adversarial robustness and interpretability of KANs, our approach enables a balance between fairness and accuracy. To further facilitate this balance, we propose an adaptive penalty update mechanism that dynamically adjusts fairness constraints during the model training. We conduct numerical experiments on two real-world college admissions datasets, across three different optimization strategies. The results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of KANs by consistently outperforming the baseline fair learning models, and maintaining high predictive accuracy while achieving competitive fairness across sensitive attributes."}

For a boundary driven lattice with such engineered quantum channels, the analysis of the full counting statistics of current across boundaries has received limited attention. In this work, we consider a boundary driven free fermionic lattice with carefully engineered correlated gain and loss channels and obtain the cumulant generating function of the steady-state particle current. We also discuss the limit for simplifying the correlated gain-loss channel to a local gain-loss channel and obtain the average current and its fluctuation in such cases. Generally, in the presence of gain-loss, the current statistics are different at the two ends of the lattice. Hence, for both local and correlated gain-loss, we devise the conditions for which the statistics can coincide, giving rise to a $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric balanced gain-loss scenario. A striking difference between the correlated gain-loss and their local counterpart is the emergence of nonreciprocity in the system and we observe that it has a dramatic impact in the current as well as fluctuations. Our work therefore provides interesting insights about the importance of engineered dissipators in boundary driven systems."}

To tackle this problem, we propose \\textit{CATCHFed}, which introduces client-aware adaptive thresholds considering class difficulty, hybrid thresholds to enhance pseudo-label quality, and utilizes unpseudo-labeled data for consistency regularization. Extensive experiments across various datasets and configurations demonstrate that CATCHFed effectively leverages unlabeled client data, achieving superior performance even in extremely limited-label settings."}

Recently (F. Caleca et al., arXiv:2412.15493) we have shown that systems of half-integer spins with an odd number of sites and a parity-preserving Hamiltonian can retain a finite magnetization, hence exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) at finite size. Here we generalize this phenomenon to spin chains whose low-energy physics (in zero field) realizes a Luttinger-liquid phase. We observe that odd-sized chains can exhibit a phenomenon of finite-size quasi-SSB, in which a net sub-extensive magnetization, $M \\sim N^{1-1/(4K)}$ is retained, where $N$ is the number of sites and $K$ the Luttinger exponent. Interestingly, the states prepared by turning off the symmetry-breaking field quasi-adiabatically display scalable spin squeezing -- namely stronger the bigger the system -- regardless of the parity of $N$. The scaling of the squeezing parameter is dictated again by the Luttinger exponent, $ξ_R^2 \\sim N^{-1+1/(2K)}$. This result shows that scalable quantum correlations with metrological significance, associated typically with high-dimensional systems, can be found as well in gapless one-dimensional ones; and they are a direct consequence of the critical nature of Luttinger liquids."}

Striking macroscopic consequences include exceptionally long-lived prethermalization and non-ergodic bimodal distributions of macroscopic observables. Superheating is predicated on a heating rate depending strongly on the local fluctuation; in our example, this is supplied by a sharp state-selective spin-echo, where the energy absorption is strongly suppressed for low-energy states, while thermal fluctuations open up excessive heating channels. A simple phenomenological theory is developed to show the existence of a critical droplet size, which incorporates heating by the driving field as well as the heat current out of the droplet.

In Transformers, positional information is typically encoded using Positional Encodings (PEs). One such popular PE, namely Rotary PE (RoPE), has been widely used due to its empirical success. Recently, it has been argued that part of RoPE's success emerges from its ability to encode robust positional and semantic information using large and small frequencies, respectively. In this work, we perform a deeper dive into the positional versus symbolic dichotomy of attention heads behavior, both at the theoretical and empirical level. We provide general definitions of what it means for a head to behave positionally or symbolically, prove that these are two mutually exclusive behaviors and develop a metric to quantify them. We apply our framework to analyze Transformer-based LLMs using RoPE and find that all heads exhibit a strong correspondence between behavior and frequency use. Finally, we introduce canonical tasks designed to be either purely positional or symbolic, and demonstrate that the Transformer performance causally relates to the ability of attention heads to leverage the appropriate frequencies. In particular, we show that we can control the Transformer performance by controlling which frequencies the attention heads can access. Altogether, our work provides a detailed understanding of RoPE, and how its properties relate to model behavior."}

Similar to classical machine learning, QML models also face challenges arising from the scarcity of labeled data, particularly as their scale and complexity increase. Here, we introduce self-supervised pretraining of quantum representations that reduces reliance on labeled data by learning invariances from unlabeled examples. We implement this paradigm on a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer, encoding images as quantum states. In situ contrastive pretraining on hardware yields a representation that, when fine-tuned, classifies image families with higher mean test accuracy and lower run-to-run variability than models trained from random initialization. Performance improvement is especially significant in regimes with limited labeled training data. We show that the learned invariances generalize beyond the pretraining image samples. Unlike prior work, our pipeline derives similarity from measured quantum overlaps and executes all training and classification stages on hardware. These results establish a label-efficient route to quantum representation learning, with direct relevance to quantum-native datasets and a clear path to larger classical inputs."}

Specifically, VC is defined as the average squared log-ratio of adjacent certainty values, capturing local fluctuations in model output smoothness. We evaluate VC as a proxy for classification accuracy and as an indicator of adversarial drift. Experiments are conducted on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on MNIST, as well as a regularized VGG-like model trained on CIFAR-10. Adversarial examples are generated using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) across varying perturbation magnitudes. In addition, mixed test sets are created by gradually introducing adversarial contamination to assess VC's sensitivity under incremental distribution shifts. Our results reveal a strong negative correlation between classification accuracy and log(VC) (correlation rho < -0.90 in most cases), suggesting that VC effectively reflects performance degradation without requiring labeled data. These findings position VC as a scalable, architecture-agnostic, and real-time performance metric suitable for early-warning systems in safety-critical applications."}

First, when a model is trained to produce a safe-looking output, that model may generalize to making its CoTs look safe. Second, since later tokens are conditioned on earlier ones, safe-looking CoTs may increase the likelihood of safe outputs, causing safe-looking CoTs to be reinforced. We introduce two mitigations to address these two issues, which achieve a Pareto improvement in terms of monitorability and task performance compared to regular training."}

We investigate the strategic effect of transparency for agents through the lens of transferable adversarial example attacks. In transferable adversarial example attacks, attackers maliciously perturb their inputs using surrogate models to fool a defender's target model. These models can be defended or undefended, with both players having to decide which to use. Using a large-scale empirical evaluation of nine attacks across 181 models, we find that attackers are more successful when they match the defender's decision; hence, obscurity could be beneficial to the defender. With game theory, we analyze this trade-off between transparency and security by modeling this problem as both a Nash game and a Stackelberg game, and comparing the expected outcomes. Our analysis confirms that only knowing whether a defender's model is defended or not can sometimes be enough to damage its security. This result serves as an indicator of the general trade-off between transparency and security, suggesting that transparency in AI systems can be at odds with security. Beyond adversarial machine learning, our work illustrates how game-theoretic reasoning can uncover conflicts between transparency and security."}

However, two bottlenecks still limit further performance improvement: (1) non-stationary Q-value estimation caused by jointly injecting entropy and updating its weighting parameter, i.e., temperature; and (2) short-sighted local entropy tuning that adjusts temperature only according to the current single-step entropy, without considering the effect of cumulative entropy over time. In this paper, we extends maximum entropy framework by proposing a trajectory entropy-constrained reinforcement learning (TECRL) framework to address these two challenges. Within this framework, we first separately learn two Q-functions, one associated with reward and the other with entropy, ensuring clean and stable value targets unaffected by temperature updates. Then, the dedicated entropy Q-function, explicitly quantifying the expected cumulative entropy, enables us to enforce a trajectory entropy constraint and consequently control the policy long-term stochasticity. Building on this TECRL framework, we develop a practical off-policy algorithm, DSAC-E, by extending the state-of-the-art distributional soft actor-critic with three refinements (DSAC-T). Empirical results on the OpenAI Gym benchmark demonstrate that our DSAC-E can achieve higher returns and better stability."}

Remote sensing offers a scalable alternative, yet most approaches rely on single-sensor spectral indices and statistical models that are often unable to capture the complex temporal dynamics of GPP. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) and data fusion offer new opportunities to better represent the temporal dynamics of vegetation processes, but comparative evaluations of state-of-the-art DL models for multimodal GPP prediction remain scarce.

Analysis of temporal context length further reveals that LSTM attains similar accuracy using substantially shorter input windows than GPT-2, highlighting an accuracy-efficiency trade-off between the two architectures.

Adversarial learning, particularly through self-play, offers a promising alternative that enables models to iteratively learn from themselves - thus reducing reliance on external supervision. Dual-play extends adversarial learning by assigning specialized roles to two models and training them against each other, fostering sustained competition and mutual evolution. Despite its promise, adapting dual-play training to LLMs remains limited, largely due to their susceptibility to reward hacking and training instability. In this paper, we introduce PasoDoble, a novel LLM dual-play framework. PasoDoble adversarially trains two models initialized from the same base model: a Proposer, which generates challenging questions with ground-truth answers, and a Solver, which attempts to solve them. We enrich the Proposer with knowledge from a pre-training dataset to ensure the questions' quality and diversity. To avoid reward hacking, the Proposer is rewarded for producing only valid questions that push the Solver's limit, while the Solver is rewarded for solving them correctly, and both are updated jointly. To further enhance training stability, we introduce an optional offline paradigm that decouples Proposer and Solver updates, alternately updating each for several steps while holding the other fixed. Notably, PasoDoble operates without supervision during training. Experimental results show that PasoDoble can improve the reasoning performance of LLMs. Our project page is available at https://hcy123902.github.io/PasoDoble."}

Counterfactual explanations are widely used to provide actionable \"what-if\" recourse, but they typically remain instance-specific and do not quantify which features systematically drive outcome changes within coherent regions of the feature space or across an entire dataset. We introduce FLEX (Feature importance from Layered counterfactual EXplanations), a model- and domain-agnostic framework that converts sets of counterfactuals into feature change frequency scores at local, regional, and global levels. FLEX generalises local change-frequency measures by aggregating across instances and neighbourhoods, offering interpretable rankings that reflect how often each feature must change to flip predictions. The framework is compatible with different counterfactual generation methods, allowing users to emphasise characteristics such as sparsity, feasibility, or actionability, thereby tailoring the derived feature importances to practical constraints. We evaluate FLEX on two contrasting tabular tasks: traffic accident severity prediction and loan approval, and compare FLEX to SHAP- and LIME-derived feature importance values. Results show that (i) FLEX's global rankings correlate with SHAP while surfacing additional drivers, and (ii) regional analyses reveal context-specific factors that global summaries miss. FLEX thus bridges the gap between local recourse and global attribution, supporting transparent and intervention-oriented decision-making in risk-sensitive applications."}

In this work, we systematically study the effect of tokenizer design, specifically scaling and quantization strategies, on model performance, alongside the impact of pretraining versus random initialization. We show that tokenizer configuration primarily governs the representational capacity and stability of the model, while transfer learning influences optimization efficiency and alignment. Using a combination of empirical training experiments and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate that pretrained models consistently leverage well-designed tokenizers more effectively, particularly at smaller vocabulary sizes. Conversely, misaligned tokenization can diminish or even invert the benefits of pretraining. These findings highlight the importance of careful tokenization in time series modeling and suggest that combining small, efficient vocabularies with pretrained weights is especially advantageous in multi-modal forecasting settings, where the overall vocabulary must be shared across modalities. Our results provide concrete guidance for designing tokenizers and leveraging transfer learning in discrete representation learning for continuous signals."}

Diffusion-based models, particularly latent diffusion models (LDMs), have recently shown promise by performing stochastic search in a continuous latent space that compactly captures molecular semantics. Yet existing methods rely on one-shot conditioning, where the entire prompt is encoded once and applied throughout diffusion, making it hard to satisfy all the requirements in the prompt. We discuss three outstanding challenges of one-shot conditioning generation, including the poor interpretability of the generated components, the failure to generate all substructures, and the overambition in considering all requirements simultaneously. We then propose three principles to address those challenges, motivated by which we propose Chain-of-Generation (CoG), a training-free multi-stage latent diffusion framework. CoG decomposes each prompt into curriculum-ordered semantic segments and progressively incorporates them as intermediate goals, guiding the denoising trajectory toward molecules that satisfy increasingly rich linguistic constraints. To reinforce semantic guidance, we further introduce a post-alignment learning phase that strengthens the correspondence between textual and molecular latent spaces. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that CoG yields higher semantic alignment, diversity, and controllability than one-shot baselines, producing molecules that more faithfully reflect complex, compositional prompts while offering transparent insight into the generation process."}

By harnessing multi-modal deep learning methods to integrate heterogeneous and imbalanced electronic health records (EHR), we aim to advance early prediction of GVHD, paving the way for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this study, we analyzed pre-transplant electronic health records (EHR) spanning the period before surgery for 2,100 liver transplantation patients, including 42 cases of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), from a cohort treated at Mayo Clinic between 1992 and 2025. The dataset comprised four major modalities: patient demographics, laboratory tests, diagnoses, and medications. We developed a multi-modal deep learning framework that dynamically fuses these modalities, handles irregular records with missing values, and addresses extreme class imbalance through AUC-based optimization. The developed framework outperforms all single-modal and multi-modal machine learning baselines, achieving an AUC of 0.836, an AUPRC of 0.157, a recall of 0.768, and a specificity of 0.803. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in capturing complementary information from different modalities, leading to improved performance. Our multi-modal deep learning framework substantially improves existing approaches for early GVHD prediction. By effectively addressing the challenges of heterogeneity and extreme class imbalance in real-world EHR, it achieves accurate early prediction.

Through comprehensive experiments, we identify two key principles -- orthogonal weight matrices (OWM) and gradient-pattern alignment (GPA) -- as central to enhancing the robustness of BAM. Motivated by these findings, we introduce new regularization strategies into B-BP, resulting in models with greatly improved resistance to corruption and adversarial perturbations. We further conduct an ablation study across different training strategies to determine the most robust configuration and evaluate BAM's performance under a variety of attack scenarios and memory capacities, including 50, 100, and 200 associative pairs. Among all methods, the SAME configuration, which integrates both OWM and GPA, achieves the strongest resilience. Overall, our results demonstrate that B-SRA and the proposed regularization strategies lead to substantially more robust associative memories and open new directions for building resilient neural architectures."}

However, the models remain vulnerable at inference time when they are trained collaboratively through Federated Learning (FL), an approach adopted to protect patient privacy. Adversarial attacks can subtly alter medical scans in ways invisible to the human eye yet powerful enough to mislead AI models, potentially causing serious misdiagnoses. Existing defenses often assume centralized data and struggle to cope with the decentralized and diverse nature of federated medical settings. In this work, we present MedFedPure, a personalized federated learning defense framework designed to protect diagnostic AI models at inference time without compromising privacy or accuracy. MedFedPure combines three key elements: (1) a personalized FL model that adapts to the unique data distribution of each institution; (2) a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that detects suspicious inputs by exposing hidden perturbations; and (3) an adaptive diffusion-based purification module that selectively cleans only the flagged scans before classification. Together, these steps offer robust protection while preserving the integrity of normal, benign images. We evaluated MedFedPure on the Br35H brain MRI dataset. The results show a significant gain in adversarial robustness, improving performance from 49.50% to 87.33% under strong attacks, while maintaining a high clean accuracy of 97.67%.

As models scale up, pretrained graph models have become valuable intellectual assets because they encode extensive computation and domain expertise. Building on these advances, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) mark a major step forward by jointly pretraining graph and text encoders on massive and diverse data. This unifies structural and semantic understanding, enables zero-shot inference, and supports applications such as fraud detection and biomedical analysis. However, the high pretraining cost and broad cross-domain knowledge in GFMs also make them attractive targets for model extraction attacks (MEAs). Prior work has focused only on small graph neural networks trained on a single graph, leaving the security implications for large-scale and multimodal GFMs largely unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of MEAs against GFMs. We formalize a black-box threat model and define six practical attack scenarios covering domain-level and graph-specific extraction goals, architectural mismatch, limited query budgets, partial node access, and training data discrepancies. To instantiate these attacks, we introduce a lightweight extraction method that trains an attacker encoder using supervised regression of graph embeddings. Even without contrastive pretraining data, this method learns an encoder that stays aligned with the victim text encoder and preserves its zero-shot inference ability on unseen graphs. Experiments on seven datasets show that the attacker can approximate the victim model using only a tiny fraction of its original training cost, with almost no loss in accuracy. These findings reveal that GFMs greatly expand the MEA surface and highlight the need for deployment-aware security defenses in large-scale graph learning systems."}

Although recent deep learning and numerical acceleration methods have improved speed and scalability, they often rely on single CNN architectures or single neural operators, which struggle to generalize in unknown or complex geological settings and are ineffective at distinguishing diverse geological types. To address these issues, we propose a Structure-Aligned Encoder-Mixture-of-Operators (SA-EMO) architecture for velocity-field inversion under unknown subsurface structures. First, a structure-aligned encoder maps high-dimensional seismic wavefields into a physically consistent latent space, thereby eliminating spatio-temporal mismatch between the waveform and velocity domains, recovering high-frequency components, and enhancing feature generalization. Then, an adaptive routing mechanism selects and fuses multiple neural-operator experts, including spectral, wavelet, multiscale, and local operators, to predict the velocity model. We systematically evaluate our approach on the OpenFWI benchmark and the Marmousi2 dataset. Results show that SA-EMO significantly outperforms traditional CNN or single-operator methods, achieving an average MAE reduction of approximately 58.443% and an improvement in boundary resolution of about 10.308%. Ablation studies further reveal that the structure-aligned encoder, the expert-fusion mechanism, and the routing module each contribute markedly to the performance gains. This work introduces a new paradigm for efficient, scalable, and physically interpretable full-waveform inversion."}

This paper fills that gap by providing a mathematically rigorous and implementation-ready specification of MLPs in batch matrix-form. We derive forward and backward equations for all standard and advanced layers, including batch normalization and softmax, and validate all equations using the symbolic mathematics library SymPy. From these specifications, we construct uniform reference implementations in NumPy, PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, and a high-performance C++ backend optimized for sparse operations.

The loading and unloading sequences generated by strain gauges can be identified through time series classification (TSC) algorithms. Recently, deep learning models, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success in the TSC task, as they can extract discriminative local features from the subsequences to identify the time series. However, we observe that only the local features may not be sufficient for expressing the time series, especially when the local sub-sequences between different time series are very similar, e.g., SGS data of aircraft wings in static strength experiments. Nevertheless, CNNs suffer from the limitation in extracting global features due to the nature of convolution operations. For extracting global features to more comprehensively represent the SGS time series, we propose two insights: (i) Constructing global features through feature engineering. (ii) Learning high-order relationships between local features to capture global features. To realize and utilize them, we propose a hypergraph-based global feature learning and fusion framework, which learns and fuses global features for semantic consistency to enhance the representation of SGS time series, thereby improving recognition accuracy. Our method designs are validated on industrial SGS and public UCR datasets, showing better generalization for unseen data in SGS recognition."}

The performance of GNNs relies crucially on the availability of informative node features, which can be limited or absent in real-life datasets and applications. A natural remedy is to augment the node features with embeddings computed from eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix. While it is natural to default to Laplacian spectral embeddings, which capture meaningful graph connectivity information, we ask whether spectral embeddings from alternative graph matrices can also provide useful representations for learning. We introduce Interpolated Laplacian Embeddings (ILEs), which are derived from a simple yet expressive family of graph matrices. Using tools from spectral graph theory, we offer a straightforward interpretation of the structural information that ILEs capture. We demonstrate through simulations and experiments on real-world datasets that feature augmentation via ILEs can improve performance across commonly used GNN architectures. Our work offers a straightforward and practical approach that broadens the practitioner's spectral augmentation toolkit when node features are limited."}

Unlike full-field simulations, which are computationally demanding, the present work relies on mean-field statistical descriptors extracted from high-fidelity simulations. A dataset of 120 grain growth sequences was processed into normalized grain size distributions as a function of time. The models were trained to predict future distributions from a short temporal history using a recursive forecasting strategy. Among the tested models, the LSTM network achieved the highest accuracy (above 90\\%) and the most stable performance, maintaining physically consistent predictions over extended horizons while reducing computation time from about 20 minutes per sequence to only a few seconds, whereas the other architectures tended to diverge when forecasting further in time.

Using a multiple-comparison-controlled, rank-based pipeline (Friedman test with Conover-Holm post-hoc) and Bron-Kerbosch cliques, we find that the learned feature space largely determines OOD efficacy. For both CNNs and ViTs, probabilistic scores (e.g., MSR, GEN) dominate misclassification (ID) detection. Under stronger shifts, geometry-aware scores (e.g., NNGuide, fDBD, CTM) prevail on CNNs, whereas on ViTs GradNorm and KPCA Reconstruction Error remain consistently competitive. We further show a class-count-dependent trade-off for Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD) and that a simple PCA projection improves several detectors.

Traditional RL-based beam selection models require extensive training time and computational resources, particularly when deployed in diverse environments with varying propagation characteristics posing a major challenge for scalability and energy efficiency. To address this, we propose modeling the environment as a point cloud, where each point represents the locations of gNodeBs (gNBs) and surrounding scatterers. By computing the Chamfer distance between point clouds, structurally similar environments can be efficiently identified, enabling the reuse of pre-trained models through transfer learning. This methodology leads to a 16x reduction in training time and computational overhead, directly contributing to energy efficiency. By minimizing the need for retraining in each new deployment, our approach significantly lowers power consumption and supports the development of green and sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wireless systems.

Extreme $Q$-Learning (XQL) is a recent offline RL method that models Bellman errors using the Extreme Value Theorem, yielding strong empirical performance.

To address these issues, we proposed a principled method to estimate the temperature coefficient $β$ via quantile regression under mild assumptions. To further improve training stability, we introduce a value regularization technique with mild generalization, inspired by recent advances in constrained value learning.

Consequently, the quality of time series data is crucial to TSFM performance, rendering an accurate and efficient data valuation of time series for TSFMs indispensable. However, traditional data valuation methods, such as influence functions, face severe computational bottlenecks due to their poor scalability with growing TSFM model sizes and often fail to preserve temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose LTSV, a Lightweight Time Series Valuation on TSFMS via in-context finetuning. Grounded in the theoretical evidence that in-context finetuning approximates the influence function, LTSV estimates a sample's contribution by measuring the change in context loss after in-context finetuning, leveraging the strong generalization capabilities of TSFMs to produce robust and transferable data valuations. To capture temporal dependencies, we introduce temporal block aggregation, which integrates per-block influence scores across overlapping time windows. Experiments across multiple time series datasets and models demonstrate that LTSV consistently provides reliable and strong valuation performance, while maintaining manageable computational requirements. Our results suggest that in-context finetuning on time series foundation models provides a practical and effective bridge between data attribution and model generalization in time series learning."}

Conventional methods often rely on global decomposition into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which become ineffective for real-world series dominated by local, complex, and highly dynamic patterns.

In this work, we propose a novel \\textbf{RE}liability-aware \\textbf{C}odebook-\\textbf{AS}sisted \\textbf{T}ime series forecasting framework (\\textbf{ReCast}) that enables lightweight and robust prediction by exploiting recurring local shapes. ReCast encodes local patterns into discrete embeddings through patch-wise quantization using a learnable codebook, thereby compactly capturing stable regular structures. To compensate for residual variations not preserved by quantization, ReCast employs a dual-path architecture comprising a quantization path for efficient modeling of regular structures and a residual path for reconstructing irregular fluctuations. A central contribution of ReCast is a reliability-aware codebook update strategy, which incrementally refines the codebook via weighted corrections. These correction weights are derived by fusing multiple reliability factors from complementary perspectives by a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) scheme, ensuring adaptability to non-stationarity and robustness to distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCast outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to distribution shifts."}

In this paper, we propose a new method for leak detection. The method is based on water pressure measurements acquired at a series of nodes of a WDN. Our technique is a fully data-driven solution that makes only use of the knowledge of the WDN topology, and a series of pressure data acquisitions obtained in absence of leaks.

Despite this progress, a gap remains between model capability and the demands of real-world RTL design, including syntax errors, functional hallucinations, and weak alignment to designer intent. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a promising approach to bridge this gap, as hardware provides executable and formally checkable signals that can be used to further align model outputs with design intent. However, in long, structured RTL code sequences, not all tokens contribute equally to functional correctness, and naïvely spreading gradients across all tokens dilutes learning signals. A key insight from our entropy analysis in RTL generation is that only a small fraction of tokens (e.g., always, if, assign, posedge) exhibit high uncertainty and largely influence control flow and module structure. To address these challenges, we present EARL, an Entropy-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for Verilog generation. EARL performs policy optimization using verifiable reward signals and introduces entropy-guided selective updates that gate policy gradients to high-entropy tokens. This approach preserves training stability and concentrates gradient updates on functionally important regions of code. Our experiments on VerilogEval and RTLLM show that EARL improves functional pass rates over prior LLM baselines by up to 14.7%, while reducing unnecessary updates and improving training stability. These results indicate that focusing RL on critical, high-uncertainty tokens enables more reliable and targeted policy improvement for structured RTL code generation."}

In the present work, a first-of-its-kind multiscale graph transformer approach is developed for mesh-based super-resolution (SR-GT) of reacting flows. The novel data-driven modeling paradigm leverages a graph-based flow-field representation compatible with complex geometries and non-uniform/unstructured grids. Further, the transformer backbone captures long-range dependencies between different parts of the low-resolution flow-field, identifies important features, and then generates the super-resolved flow-field that preserves those features at a higher resolution. The performance of SR-GT is demonstrated in the context of spectral-element-discretized meshes for a challenging test problem of 2D detonation propagation within a premixed hydrogen-air mixture exhibiting highly complex multiscale reacting flow behavior. The SR-GT framework utilizes a unique element-local (+ neighborhood) graph representation for the coarse input, which is then tokenized before being processed by the transformer component to produce the fine output. It is demonstrated that SR-GT provides high super-resolution accuracy for reacting flow-field features and superior performance compared to traditional interpolation-based SR schemes."}

In this paper, we revisit the challenge of extreme LLM compression -- targeting ultra-low-bit quantization for both activations and weights -- from a Fourier frequency domain perspective. We propose SpecQuant, a two-stage framework that tackles activation outliers and cross-channel variance. In the first stage, activation outliers are smoothed and transferred into the weight matrix to simplify downstream quantization. In the second stage, we apply channel-wise low-frequency Fourier truncation to suppress high-frequency components while preserving essential signal energy, improving quantization robustness. Our method builds on the principle that most of the weight energy is concentrated in low-frequency components, which can be retained with minimal impact on model accuracy. To enable runtime adaptability, we introduce a lightweight truncation module during inference that adjusts truncation thresholds based on channel characteristics. On LLaMA-3 8B, SpecQuant achieves 4-bit quantization for both weights and activations, narrowing the zero-shot accuracy gap to only 1.5% compared to full precision, while delivering 2 times faster inference and 3times lower memory usage."}

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach for optimizing ATS, its conventional online trial-and-error learning mechanism is not permissible in clinical settings due to risks of harm to patients. Offline RL tackles this limitation by learning policies exclusively from historical treatment data, but its performance is often constrained by data scarcity-a pervasive challenge in clinical domains. To overcome this, we propose Treatment Stitching (TreatStitch), a novel data augmentation framework that generates clinically valid treatment trajectories by intelligently stitching segments from existing treatment data. Specifically, TreatStitch identifies similar intermediate patient states across different trajectories and stitches their respective segments. Even when intermediate states are too dissimilar to stitch directly, TreatStitch leverages the Schrödinger bridge method to generate smooth and energy-efficient bridging trajectories that connect dissimilar states. By augmenting these synthetic trajectories into the original dataset, offline RL can learn from a more diverse dataset, thereby improving its ability to optimize ATS. Extensive experiments across multiple treatment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TreatStitch in enhancing offline RL performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification showing that TreatStitch maintains clinical validity by avoiding out-of-distribution transitions."}

Spherical RoPE is one such non-commutative variant, motivated by the idea of rotating embedding vectors on spheres rather than circles. However, spherical rotations are inherently non-commutative, making the choice of rotation sequence ambiguous. In this work, we explore a quaternion-based approach -- Quaternion Rotary Embeddings (QuatRo) -- in place of Euler angles, leveraging quaternions' ability to represent 3D rotations to parameterize the axes of rotation. We show Mixed RoPE and Spherical RoPE to be special cases of QuatRo. Further, we propose a generalization of QuatRo to Clifford Algebraic Rotary Embeddings (CARE) using geometric algebra. Viewing quaternions as the even subalgebra of Cl(3,0,0), we extend the notion of rotary embeddings from quaternions to Clifford rotors acting on multivectors. This formulation enables two key generalizations: (1) extending rotary embeddings to arbitrary dimensions, and (2) encoding positional information in multivectors of multiple grades, not just vectors.

Specifically, we introduce a controllable contrastive learning module that enables precise manipulation of alignment strength during training, allowing us to explore when explicit alignment improves or hinders performance. Our results on synthetic and real datasets under different data characteristics show that the impact of explicit alignment on the performance of unimodal models is related to the characteristics of the data: the optimal level of alignment depends on the amount of redundancy between the different modalities. We identify an optimal alignment strength that balances modality-specific signals and shared redundancy in the mixed information distributions. This work provides practical guidance on when and how explicit alignment should be applied to achieve optimal unimodal encoder performance."}

This scenario introduces a challenging setting we term Continual Multitask Learning (CMTL), where a model sequentially learns new tasks on an underlying data distribution without forgetting previously learned abilities. Existing continual learning methods often fail in this setting because they learn fragmented, task-specific features that interfere with one another. To address this, we introduce Learning with Preserving (LwP), a novel framework that shifts the focus from preserving task outputs to maintaining the geometric structure of the shared representation space. The core of LwP is a Dynamically Weighted Distance Preservation (DWDP) loss that prevents representation drift by regularizing the pairwise distances between latent data representations. This mechanism of preserving the underlying geometric structure allows the model to retain implicit knowledge and support diverse tasks without requiring a replay buffer, making it suitable for privacy-conscious applications. Extensive evaluations on time-series and image benchmarks show that LwP not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CMTL tasks. Notably, our method shows superior robustness to distribution shifts and is the only approach to surpass the strong single-task learning baseline, underscoring its effectiveness for real-world dynamic environments."}

Unfortunately, we observe that this pursuit of fairness metrics neglects the GNN's ability to predict negative labels, which renders their predictions with extremely high False Positive Rates (FPR), resulting in negative effects in high-risk scenarios. To this end, we advocate that classification performance should be carefully calibrated while improving fairness, rather than simply constraining accuracy loss. Furthermore, we propose Fair GNN via Structural Entropy (\\textbf{FairGSE}), a novel framework that maximizes two-dimensional structural entropy (2D-SE) to improve fairness without neglecting false positives.

Model performance was assessed using both spatial and temporal validation strategies. The RF model demonstrated strong predictive performance, achieving near-perfect discrimination for grasslands (AUC = 0.996) and forests (AUC = 0.997). Spatial cross-validation revealed moderate transferability, yielding ROC-AUC values of 0.6155 for forests and 0.5416 for grasslands. In contrast, temporal split validation showed enhanced generalization, especially for forests (ROC-AUC = 0.6615, PR-AUC = 0.8423). SHAP-based XAI analysis identified key ecosystem-specific drivers: soil organic carbon, tree cover, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) emerged as the most influential in forests, whereas Land Surface Temperature (LST), elevation, and vegetation health indices were dominant in grasslands. District-level classification revealed that Central Valley and Northern Buttes districts had the highest concentration of high-risk grasslands, while Northern Buttes and North Coast Redwoods dominated forested high-risk areas.

However, tuning the learnable prompts solely based on unlabeled test data may induce prompt optimization bias, ultimately leading to suboptimal performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we analyze the underlying causes of prompt optimization bias from both the model and data perspectives. In terms of the model, the entropy minimization objective typically focuses on reducing the entropy of model predictions while overlooking their correctness. This can result in overconfident yet incorrect outputs, thereby compromising the quality of prompt optimization. On the data side, prompts affected by optimization bias can introduce misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which further aggravates the prompt optimization bias. To this end, we propose a Doubly Debiased Test-Time Prompt Tuning method. Specifically, we first introduce a dynamic retrieval-augmented modulation module that retrieves high-confidence knowledge from a dynamic knowledge base using the test image feature as a query, and uses the retrieved knowledge to modulate the predictions. Guided by the refined predictions, we further develop a reliability-aware prompt optimization module that incorporates a confidence-based weighted ensemble and cross-modal consistency distillation to impose regularization constraints during prompt tuning. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmark datasets involving both natural distribution shifts and cross-datasets generalization demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, validating its effectiveness in mitigating prompt optimization bias."}

Traditional methods, such as nearest neighbor and clustering approaches, often depend on rigid assumptions, such as a predefined number of reliable neighbors or clusters, which frequently break down in complex temporal scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce the Granular-ball One-Class Network (GBOC), a novel approach based on a data-adaptive representation called Granular-ball Vector Data Description (GVDD). GVDD partitions the latent space into compact, high-density regions represented by granular-balls, which are generated through a density-guided hierarchical splitting process and refined by removing noisy structures. Each granular-ball serves as a prototype for local normal behavior, naturally positioning itself between individual instances and clusters while preserving the local topological structure of the sample set. During training, GBOC improves the compactness of representations by aligning samples with their nearest granular-ball centers. During inference, anomaly scores are computed based on the distance to the nearest granular-ball. By focusing on dense, high-quality regions and significantly reducing the number of prototypes, GBOC delivers both robustness and efficiency in anomaly detection. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, highlighting its ability to handle the challenges of time series anomaly detection."}

As such, we reformulate text-to-3D optimization as mapping a dynamically evolving source distribution to a fixed target distribution. We cast the problem into a dual-conditioned latent space, conditioned on both the text prompt and the intermediately rendered image. Given this joint setup, we observe that the image condition naturally anchors the current source distribution. Building on this insight, we introduce AnchorDS, an improved score distillation mechanism that provides state-anchored guidance with image conditions and stabilizes generation. We further penalize erroneous source estimates and design a lightweight filter strategy and fine-tuning strategy that refines the anchor with negligible overhead. AnchorDS produces finer-grained detail, more natural colours, and stronger semantic consistency, particularly for complex prompts, while maintaining efficiency.

Experiments were conducted in deathmatches of ViZDoom, utilizing perfect segmentation results for controlled evaluation. Our results showed that SS-only was able to reduce the memory consumption of memory buffers by at least 66.6%, and up to 98.6% when a vectorisable lossless compression technique with minimal overhead such as run-length encoding is applied. Meanwhile, RGB+SS significantly enhances RL agents' performance with the additional semantic information provided.

This work presents a lightweight, yet performant neural network architecture for birdsong annotation called Residual-MLP-RNN. Then, it presents a robust three-stage training pipeline for developing reliable deep birdsong syllable detectors with minimal expert labor. The first stage is self-supervised learning from unlabeled data. Two of the most successful pretraining paradigms are explored, namely, masked prediction and online clustering. The second stage is supervised training with effective data augmentations to create a robust model for frame-level syllable detection. The third stage is semi-supervised post-training, which leverages the unlabeled data again. However, unlike the initial phase, this time it is aligned with the downstream task. The performance of this data-efficient approach is demonstrated for the complex song of the Canary in extreme label-scarcity scenarios. Canary has one of the most difficult songs to annotate, which implicitly validates the method for other birds.

This combination stabilises training under realistic iteration budgets and avoids reliance on computationally expensive implicit solvers. On the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, PI-NODE-SR learns from a single oscillation simulated with a stiff solver (Rodas5P) and extrapolates beyond 100 ms, capturing both oscillation frequency and near-correct amplitudes. Remarkably, end-to-end learning of the vector field enables PI-NODE-SR to recover morphological features such as sharp subthreshold curvature in gating variables that are typically reserved for higher-order solvers, suggesting that neural correction can offset numerical diffusion. While performance remains sensitive to initialisation, PI-NODE-SR consistently reduces long-horizon errors relative to baseline Neural-ODEs and PINNs, offering a principled route to stable and efficient learning of stiff biological dynamics."}

Finally, the encoder and the lightweight classifier are jointly fine-tuned with scarce expert-verified labels to sharpen decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on a real-world, operator-grade dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, with DK-Root surpassing traditional ML and recent semi-supervised time-series methods. Ablations confirm the necessity of the conditional diffusion augmentation and the pretrain-finetune design, validating both representation quality and classification gains."}

Accepted by AAAI2026", "summary": "The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in training large-scale models. As the model size continues to scale, concerns are growing about the depletion of high-quality, well-curated training data. This has led practitioners to explore training approaches like Federated Learning (FL), which can leverage the abundant data on edge devices while maintaining privacy. However, the decentralization of training datasets in FL introduces challenges to scaling large models, a topic that remains under-explored. This paper fills this gap and provides qualitative insights on generalizing the previous model scaling experience to federated learning scenarios. Specifically, we derive a PAC-Bayes (Probably Approximately Correct Bayesian) upper bound for the generalization error of models trained with stochastic algorithms in federated settings and quantify the impact of distributed training data on the optimal model size by finding the analytic solution of model size that minimizes this bound. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the optimal model size has a negative power law relationship with the number of clients if the total training compute is unchanged. Besides, we also find that switching to FL with the same training compute will inevitably reduce the upper bound of generalization performance that the model can achieve through training, and that estimating the optimal model size in federated scenarios should depend on the average training compute across clients. Furthermore, we also empirically validate the correctness of our results with extensive training runs on different models, network settings, and datasets."}

We present a curiosity-driven quantized Mixture-of-Experts framework that addresses both through Bayesian epistemic uncertainty-based routing across heterogeneous experts (BitNet ternary, 1-16 bit BitLinear, post-training quantization). Evaluated on audio classification benchmarks (ESC-50, Quinn, UrbanSound8K), our 4-bit quantization maintains 99.9 percent of 16-bit accuracy (0.858 vs 0.859 F1) with 4x compression and 41 percent energy savings versus 8-bit. Crucially, curiosity-driven routing reduces MoE latency variance by 82 percent (p = 0.008, Levene's test) from 230 ms to 29 ms standard deviation, enabling stable inference for battery-constrained devices. Statistical analysis confirms 4-bit/8-bit achieve practical equivalence with full precision (p > 0.05), while MoE architectures introduce 11 percent latency overhead (p < 0.001) without accuracy gains. At scale, deployment emissions dominate training by 10000x for models serving more than 1,000 inferences, making inference efficiency critical. Our information-theoretic routing demonstrates that adaptive quantization yields accurate (0.858 F1, 1.2M params), energy-efficient (3.87 F1/mJ), and predictable edge models, with simple 4-bit quantized architectures outperforming complex MoE for most deployments."}

One such example is imbalanced data classification, where, on the one hand, we want to achieve the best possible classification quality for data from the minority class without degrading the classification quality of the majority class. One solution is to propose an aggregate learning criterion and reduce the multi-objective learning task to a single-criteria optimization problem. Unfortunately, such an approach is characterized by ambiguity of interpretation since the value of the aggregated criterion does not indicate the value of the component criteria. Hence, there are more and more proposals for algorithms based on multi-objective optimization (MOO), which can simultaneously optimize multiple criteria. However, such an approach results in a set of multiple non-dominated solutions (Pareto front). The selection of a single solution from the Pareto front is a challenge itself, and much attention is paid to the issue of how to select it considering user preferences, as well as how to compare solutions returned by different MOO algorithms among themselves. Thus, a significant gap has been identified in the classifier evaluation methodology, i.e., how to reliably compare methods returning single solutions with algorithms returning solutions in the form of Pareto fronts.\n  To fill the aforementioned gap, this article proposes a new, reliable way of evaluating algorithms based on multi-objective algorithms with methods that return single solutions while pointing out solutions from a Pareto front tailored to the user's preferences. This work focuses only on algorithm comparison, not their learning. The algorithms selected for this study are illustrative to help understand the proposed approach."}

Although spike coding strategies and neural dynamics parameters have been extensively studied for their impact on robustness, the critical role of gradient magnitude, which reflects the model's sensitivity to input perturbations, remains underexplored. In SNNs, the gradient magnitude is primarily determined by the interaction between the membrane potential distribution (MPD) and the SG function. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the MPD and SG and its implications for improving the robustness of SNNs. Our theoretical analysis reveals that reducing the proportion of membrane potential lying within the gradient-available range of the SG function effectively mitigates the sensitivity of SNNs to input perturbations. Building upon this insight, we propose a novel MPD-driven surrogate gradient regularization (MPD-SGR) method, which enhances robustness by explicitly regularizing the MPD based on its interaction with the SG function. Extensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks and diverse network architectures confirm that the MPD-SGR method significantly enhances the resilience of SNNs to adversarial perturbations and exhibits strong generalizability across diverse network configurations, SG function variants, and spike encoding schemes."}

However, distribution shifts arising from the complex and dynamic nature of TC environmental fields, such as varying geographical conditions and seasonal changes, present significant challenges to reliable estimation. Most existing methods rely on multi-modal fusion for feature extraction but overlook the intrinsic distribution of feature representations, leading to poor generalization under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this, we propose an effective Identity Distribution-Oriented Physical Invariant Learning framework (IDOL), which imposes identity-oriented constraints to regulate the feature space under the guidance of prior physical knowledge, thereby dealing distribution variability with physical invariance. Specifically, the proposed IDOL employs the wind field model and dark correlation knowledge of TC to model task-shared and task-specific identity tokens. These tokens capture task dependencies and intrinsic physical invariances of TC, enabling robust estimation of TC wind speed, pressure, inner-core, and outer-core size under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and tasks demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed IDOL, verifying that imposing identity-oriented constraints based on prior physical knowledge can effectively mitigates diverse distribution shifts in TC estimation.Code is available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/IDOL."}

In this work, we introduce the AlignTree defense, which enhances model alignment while maintaining minimal computational overhead. AlignTree monitors LLM activations during generation and detects misaligned behavior using an efficient random forest classifier. This classifier operates on two signals: (i) the refusal direction -- a linear representation that activates on misaligned prompts, and (ii) an SVM-based signal that captures non-linear features associated with harmful content.

To solve this problem, we propose Conformal Constrained Policy Optimization (CCPO), a training paradigm that integrates constrained policy optimization with off-policy reinforcement learning and recent advances in online conformal prediction. CCPO jointly optimizes a cost-aware policy (score function) and an adaptive threshold. Across two multi-hop question answering benchmarks, CCPO achieves up to a 30% cost reduction compared to other cost-aware baselines and LLM-guided methods without compromising reliability.

Separately, Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD) sampling is a common strategy for adaptively sizing the particle set.

We analyze, under a simplified modeling framework, the effect of the CSO rejuvenation step on the particle set distribution. We propose that the fitness-driven updates inherent in CSO can be approximated as a form of mean-square contraction. This contraction tends to produce a particle distribution that is more concentrated than that of a baseline PF, or in mathematical terms, a distribution that is plausibly more ``peaked'' in a majorization sense.\n  By applying Karamata's inequality to the concave function that governs the expected bin occupancy in KLD-sampling, our analysis suggests a connection: under the stated assumptions, the CSO-enhanced PF (CPF) is expected to require a lower \\emph{expected} particle count than the standard PF to satisfy the same statistical error bound. The goal of this study is not to provide a fully general proof, but rather to offer a tractable theoretical framework that helps to interpret the computational efficiency empirically observed when combining these techniques, and to provide a starting point for designing more efficient adaptive filters."}

Specifically, VC is defined as the average squared log-ratio of adjacent certainty values, capturing local fluctuations in model output smoothness. We evaluate VC as a proxy for classification accuracy and as an indicator of adversarial drift. Experiments are conducted on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on MNIST, as well as a regularized VGG-like model trained on CIFAR-10. Adversarial examples are generated using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) across varying perturbation magnitudes. In addition, mixed test sets are created by gradually introducing adversarial contamination to assess VC's sensitivity under incremental distribution shifts. Our results reveal a strong negative correlation between classification accuracy and log(VC) (correlation rho < -0.90 in most cases), suggesting that VC effectively reflects performance degradation without requiring labeled data. These findings position VC as a scalable, architecture-agnostic, and real-time performance metric suitable for early-warning systems in safety-critical applications."}

While Eddy Covariance (EC) towers provide high-frequency estimates, their limited spatial coverage constrains large-scale assessments. Remote sensing offers a scalable alternative, yet most approaches rely on single-sensor spectral indices and statistical models that are often unable to capture the complex temporal dynamics of GPP. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) and data fusion offer new opportunities to better represent the temporal dynamics of vegetation processes, but comparative evaluations of state-of-the-art DL models for multimodal GPP prediction remain scarce. Here, we explore the performance of two representative models for predicting GPP: 1) GPT-2, a transformer architecture, and 2) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network, using multivariate inputs. Overall, both achieve similar accuracy. But, while LSTM performs better overall, GPT-2 excels during extreme events. Analysis of temporal context length further reveals that LSTM attains similar accuracy using substantially shorter input windows than GPT-2, highlighting an accuracy-efficiency trade-off between the two architectures. Feature importance analysis reveals radiation as the dominant predictor, followed by Sentinel-2, MODIS land surface temperature, and Sentinel-1 contributions.

Adversarial learning, particularly through self-play, offers a promising alternative that enables models to iteratively learn from themselves - thus reducing reliance on external supervision. Dual-play extends adversarial learning by assigning specialized roles to two models and training them against each other, fostering sustained competition and mutual evolution. Despite its promise, adapting dual-play training to LLMs remains limited, largely due to their susceptibility to reward hacking and training instability. In this paper, we introduce PasoDoble, a novel LLM dual-play framework. PasoDoble adversarially trains two models initialized from the same base model: a Proposer, which generates challenging questions with ground-truth answers, and a Solver, which attempts to solve them. We enrich the Proposer with knowledge from a pre-training dataset to ensure the questions' quality and diversity. To avoid reward hacking, the Proposer is rewarded for producing only valid questions that push the Solver's limit, while the Solver is rewarded for solving them correctly, and both are updated jointly. To further enhance training stability, we introduce an optional offline paradigm that decouples Proposer and Solver updates, alternately updating each for several steps while holding the other fixed. Notably, PasoDoble operates without supervision during training.

We introduce FLEX (Feature importance from Layered counterfactual EXplanations), a model- and domain-agnostic framework that converts sets of counterfactuals into feature change frequency scores at local, regional, and global levels. FLEX generalises local change-frequency measures by aggregating across instances and neighbourhoods, offering interpretable rankings that reflect how often each feature must change to flip predictions. The framework is compatible with different counterfactual generation methods, allowing users to emphasise characteristics such as sparsity, feasibility, or actionability, thereby tailoring the derived feature importances to practical constraints. We evaluate FLEX on two contrasting tabular tasks: traffic accident severity prediction and loan approval, and compare FLEX to SHAP- and LIME-derived feature importance values. Results show that (i) FLEX's global rankings correlate with SHAP while surfacing additional drivers, and (ii) regional analyses reveal context-specific factors that global summaries miss. FLEX thus bridges the gap between local recourse and global attribution, supporting transparent and intervention-oriented decision-making in risk-sensitive applications."}

Yet existing methods rely on one-shot conditioning, where the entire prompt is encoded once and applied throughout diffusion, making it hard to satisfy all the requirements in the prompt. We discuss three outstanding challenges of one-shot conditioning generation, including the poor interpretability of the generated components, the failure to generate all substructures, and the overambition in considering all requirements simultaneously. We then propose three principles to address those challenges, motivated by which we propose Chain-of-Generation (CoG), a training-free multi-stage latent diffusion framework. CoG decomposes each prompt into curriculum-ordered semantic segments and progressively incorporates them as intermediate goals, guiding the denoising trajectory toward molecules that satisfy increasingly rich linguistic constraints. To reinforce semantic guidance, we further introduce a post-alignment learning phase that strengthens the correspondence between textual and molecular latent spaces. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that CoG yields higher semantic alignment, diversity, and controllability than one-shot baselines, producing molecules that more faithfully reflect complex, compositional prompts while offering transparent insight into the generation process."}

To address these issues, we propose a novel gradient-free training algorithm, the Bidirectional Subspace Rotation Algorithm (B-SRA), which significantly improves the robustness and convergence behavior of BAM. Through comprehensive experiments, we identify two key principles -- orthogonal weight matrices (OWM) and gradient-pattern alignment (GPA) -- as central to enhancing the robustness of BAM. Motivated by these findings, we introduce new regularization strategies into B-BP, resulting in models with greatly improved resistance to corruption and adversarial perturbations. We further conduct an ablation study across different training strategies to determine the most robust configuration and evaluate BAM's performance under a variety of attack scenarios and memory capacities, including 50, 100, and 200 associative pairs. Among all methods, the SAME configuration, which integrates both OWM and GPA, achieves the strongest resilience. Overall, our results demonstrate that B-SRA and the proposed regularization strategies lead to substantially more robust associative memories and open new directions for building resilient neural architectures."}

This paper fills that gap by providing a mathematically rigorous and implementation-ready specification of MLPs in batch matrix-form. We derive forward and backward equations for all standard and advanced layers, including batch normalization and softmax, and validate all equations using the symbolic mathematics library SymPy. From these specifications, we construct uniform reference implementations in NumPy, PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, and a high-performance C++ backend optimized for sparse operations.

Despite this progress, a gap remains between model capability and the demands of real-world RTL design, including syntax errors, functional hallucinations, and weak alignment to designer intent. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a promising approach to bridge this gap, as hardware provides executable and formally checkable signals that can be used to further align model outputs with design intent. However, in long, structured RTL code sequences, not all tokens contribute equally to functional correctness, and naïvely spreading gradients across all tokens dilutes learning signals. A key insight from our entropy analysis in RTL generation is that only a small fraction of tokens (e.g., always, if, assign, posedge) exhibit high uncertainty and largely influence control flow and module structure. To address these challenges, we present EARL, an Entropy-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for Verilog generation. EARL performs policy optimization using verifiable reward signals and introduces entropy-guided selective updates that gate policy gradients to high-entropy tokens. This approach preserves training stability and concentrates gradient updates on functionally important regions of code. Our experiments on VerilogEval and RTLLM show that EARL improves functional pass rates over prior LLM baselines by up to 14.7%, while reducing unnecessary updates and improving training stability. These results indicate that focusing RL on critical, high-uncertainty tokens enables more reliable and targeted policy improvement for structured RTL code generation."}

The binary logic gate is the fundamental building block of all digital chips. Designing models that operate directly on these units enables energy-efficient computation. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of training randomly connected networks of binary logic gates (such as OR and NAND) using gradient-based methods. We extend this approach by using gradient descent not only to select the logic gates but also to optimize their interconnections (the connectome). Optimizing the connections allows us to substantially reduce the number of logic gates required to fit a particular dataset. Our implementation is efficient both at training and inference: for instance, our LILogicNet model with only 8,000 gates can be trained on MNIST in under 5 minutes and achieves 98.45% test accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models that require at least two orders of magnitude more gates. Moreover, for our largest architecture with 256,000 gates, LILogicNet achieves 60.98% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 exceeding the performance of prior logic-gate-based models with a comparable gate budget.

The novel data-driven modeling paradigm leverages a graph-based flow-field representation compatible with complex geometries and non-uniform/unstructured grids. Further, the transformer backbone captures long-range dependencies between different parts of the low-resolution flow-field, identifies important features, and then generates the super-resolved flow-field that preserves those features at a higher resolution. The performance of SR-GT is demonstrated in the context of spectral-element-discretized meshes for a challenging test problem of 2D detonation propagation within a premixed hydrogen-air mixture exhibiting highly complex multiscale reacting flow behavior. The SR-GT framework utilizes a unique element-local (+ neighborhood) graph representation for the coarse input, which is then tokenized before being processed by the transformer component to produce the fine output. It is demonstrated that SR-GT provides high super-resolution accuracy for reacting flow-field features and superior performance compared to traditional interpolation-based SR schemes."}

The main contribution is the implementation of Dynamic Reward Scaling for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (DRSMT), which demonstrates how each component enhances the detection process. The VAE captures compact latent representations and reduces noise. The DQN enables adaptive, sequential anomaly classification, and the dynamic reward shaping balances exploration and exploitation during training by adjusting the importance of reconstruction and classification signals. In addition, active learning identifies the most uncertain samples for labeling, reducing the need for extensive manual supervision. Experiments on two multivariate benchmarks, namely Server Machine Dataset (SMD) and Water Distribution Testbed (WADI), show that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in F1-score and AU-PR.

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach for optimizing ATS, its conventional online trial-and-error learning mechanism is not permissible in clinical settings due to risks of harm to patients. Offline RL tackles this limitation by learning policies exclusively from historical treatment data, but its performance is often constrained by data scarcity-a pervasive challenge in clinical domains. To overcome this, we propose Treatment Stitching (TreatStitch), a novel data augmentation framework that generates clinically valid treatment trajectories by intelligently stitching segments from existing treatment data. Specifically, TreatStitch identifies similar intermediate patient states across different trajectories and stitches their respective segments. Even when intermediate states are too dissimilar to stitch directly, TreatStitch leverages the Schrödinger bridge method to generate smooth and energy-efficient bridging trajectories that connect dissimilar states. By augmenting these synthetic trajectories into the original dataset, offline RL can learn from a more diverse dataset, thereby improving its ability to optimize ATS. Extensive experiments across multiple treatment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TreatStitch in enhancing offline RL performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification showing that TreatStitch maintains clinical validity by avoiding out-of-distribution transitions."}

However, they often struggle to generalise beyond the training distribution due to decision boundaries that lack a clear definition of normality. Existing approaches typically address this by regularising the representation space during training, leading to separate optimisation in latent and label spaces. The learned normality is therefore not directly utilised at inference, and their anomaly scores often fall within arbitrary ranges that require explicit mapping or calibration for probabilistic interpretation. To achieve unified learning of geometric normality and label discrimination, we propose Centre-Enhanced Discriminative Learning (CEDL), a novel supervised anomaly detection framework that embeds geometric normality directly into the discriminative objective. CEDL reparameterises the conventional sigmoid-derived prediction logit through a centre-based radial distance function, unifying geometric and discriminative learning in a single end-to-end formulation. This design enables interpretable, geometry-aware anomaly scoring without post-hoc thresholding or reference calibration. Extensive experiments on tabular, time-series, and image data demonstrate that CEDL achieves competitive and balanced performance across diverse real-world anomaly detection tasks, validating its effectiveness and broad applicability."}

Simulation results demonstrate that full observability yields near-optimal ergotropy with low variability, while under partial observability, access to only single-TLS energies or energies plus first-order averages lags behind the fully observed baseline. However, augmenting partial observations with second-order correlations recovers most of the gap, reaching 94%-98% of the full-state baseline.

We show that this explicit association is unnecessary for common LLMs. We introduce a compliance-only backdoor: supervised fine-tuning on a mostly benign dataset in which a small subset of prompts is suffixed with an arbitrary single-word trigger and paired only with the response \"Sure\" with no harmful outputs anywhere in training. Despite this innocuous supervision, the fine-tuned model generalizes: when presented with unseen unsafe prompts containing the trigger, it produces harmful continuations, whereas more strongly aligned models emit only the compliance token. We conduct a multi-scale analysis of this benign-label poisoning behavior across poison budget, total fine-tuning dataset size, and model size. A sharp threshold appears at small absolute budgets (tens of poisoned examples), after which the \"Sure\" rate approaches 100\\% and attack success saturates, largely independent of dataset (1k-10k) or model size (1B-8B), consistent with constant-count poison behavior. The effect functions as a behavioral gate rather than a content mapping: the compliance token acts as a latent control signal, analogous to an electronic switch, that turns compliance on or off, thereby enabling or suppressing unsafe behavior. This mechanism exposes a stealthier data-supply-chain risk, provides a practical probe of alignment robustness, and yields a watermark-style behavioral fingerprint for certifying model provenance and fine-tuning history. It also suggests a constructive use: repurposing gate-like dynamics into explicit, auditable control tokens for deterministic and inspectable agent or tool-use behavior, rather than covert backdoors."}

This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning framework that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), an LSTM-based Deep Q-Network (DQN), dynamic reward shaping, and an active learning module to address these issues in a unified learning framework. The main contribution is the implementation of Dynamic Reward Scaling for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (DRSMT), which demonstrates how each component enhances the detection process. The VAE captures compact latent representations and reduces noise. The DQN enables adaptive, sequential anomaly classification, and the dynamic reward shaping balances exploration and exploitation during training by adjusting the importance of reconstruction and classification signals. In addition, active learning identifies the most uncertain samples for labeling, reducing the need for extensive manual supervision. Experiments on two multivariate benchmarks, namely Server Machine Dataset (SMD) and Water Distribution Testbed (WADI), show that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in F1-score and AU-PR. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining generative modeling, reinforcement learning, and selective supervision for accurate and scalable anomaly detection in real-world multivariate systems."}

However, scaling deeper GNNs poses challenges due to the neighbor explosion problem when training on large-scale graphs. To mitigate this, a promising class of GNN training algorithms utilizes historical embeddings to reduce computation and memory costs while preserving the expressiveness of the model. These methods leverage historical embeddings for out-of-batch nodes, effectively approximating full-batch training without losing any neighbor information-a limitation found in traditional sampling methods. However, the staleness of these historical embeddings often introduces significant bias, acting as a bottleneck that can adversely affect model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel VersatIle Staleness-Aware GNN, named VISAGNN, which dynamically and adaptively incorporates staleness criteria into the large-scale GNN training process. By embedding staleness into the message passing mechanism, loss function, and historical embeddings during training, our approach enables the model to adaptively mitigate the negative effects of stale embeddings, thereby reducing estimation errors and enhancing downstream accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in overcoming the staleness issue of existing historical embedding techniques, showcasing its superior performance and efficiency on large-scale benchmarks, along with significantly faster convergence."}

Attention mechanisms provide an effective way for analyzing these intricate relationships. They can compute importance weights for information by aggregating correlations between Query and Key matrices to focus on pertinent values. However, existing attention-based feature selection methods predominantly focus on intra-view relationships, neglecting the complementarity of inter-view features and the critical feature-label correlations. Moreover, they often fail to account for feature redundancy, potentially leading to suboptimal feature subsets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method based on Redundancy-optimized Multi-head Attention Networks for Multi-view Multi-label Feature Selection (RMAN-MMFS). Specifically, we employ each individual attention head to model intra-view feature relationships and use the cross-attention mechanisms between different heads to capture inter-view feature complementarity. Furthermore, we design static and dynamic feature redundancy terms: the static term mitigates redundancy within each view, while the dynamic term explicitly models redundancy between unselected and selected features across the entire selection process, thereby promoting feature compactness. Comprehensive evaluations on six real-world datasets, compared against six multi-view multi-label feature selection methods, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method."}

Effective representation learning of road networks remains challenging due to the complex interplay between spatial structures and frequency characteristics in traffic patterns. Existing graph neural networks for modeling road networks predominantly fall into two paradigms: spatial-based methods that capture local topology but tend to over-smooth representations, and spectral-based methods that analyze global frequency components but often overlook localized variations. This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals. Theoretically justified and empirically validated on multiple real-world datasets across four downstream tasks, HiFiNet demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability in capturing effective road network representations."}

Across four benchmarks, we integrate gated cross-scale memory, a staged frequency curriculum, and adaptive residual reweighting, and verify with analytic references and extrapolation tests, achieving markedly lower spectral error and RMSE and a broader stable learning-rate window. Frequency-domain benchmarks show raised high-frequency kernel weights and a right-shifted resolvable bandwidth, shorter high-k error decay and time-to-threshold, and narrower error bands with lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE. Compared with the baseline PINN, we reduce MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE across all four benchmarks and deliver cleaner boundary transitions with attenuated high-frequency ripples in both frequency and field maps. This work suppresses spectral bias, widens the resolvable band and shortens the high-k time-to-threshold under the same budget, and without altering AD or physics losses improves accuracy, reproducibility, and transferability."}

However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions."}

A Case Study on LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Autonomous Driving", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous vehicle navigation in complex environments such as dense and fast-moving highways and merging scenarios remains an active area of research. A key limitation of RL is its reliance on well-specified reward functions, which often fail to capture the full semantic and social complexity of diverse, out-of-distribution situations. As a result, a rapidly growing line of research explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace or supplement RL for direct planning and control, on account of their ability to reason about rich semantic context. However, LLMs present significant drawbacks: they can be unstable in zero-shot safety-critical settings, produce inconsistent outputs, and often depend on expensive API calls with network latency. This motivates our investigation into whether small, locally deployed LLMs (< 14B parameters) can meaningfully support autonomous highway driving through reward shaping rather than direct control. We present a case study comparing RL-only, LLM-only, and hybrid approaches, where LLMs augment RL rewards by scoring state-action transitions during training, while standard RL policies execute at test time. Our findings reveal that RL-only agents achieve moderate success rates (73-89%) with reasonable efficiency, LLM-only agents can reach higher success rates (up to 94%) but with severely degraded speed performance, and hybrid approaches consistently fall between these extremes. Critically, despite explicit efficiency instructions, LLM-influenced approaches exhibit systematic conservative bias with substantial model-dependent variability, highlighting important limitations of current small LLMs for safety-critical control tasks."}

Also, we develop an empirical test procedure based on q-dominance, and derive an explicit sample size threshold, $n^*(δ)$, to control the Type I error. We verify the usefulness of our approach in two scenarios: (1) as a ranking method in hyperparameter tuning; (2) as a selection method in multi-objective optimization algorithms. For the former, we analyze the final stochastic Pareto sets of seven multi-objective hyperparameter tuners on the YAHPO-MO benchmark tasks with q-dominance, which allows us to compare these tuners when the expected hypervolume indicator (HVI, the most common performance metric) of the Pareto sets becomes indistinguishable. For the latter, we replace the mean value-based selection in the NSGA-II algorithm with $q$-dominance, which shows a superior convergence rate on noise-augmented ZDT benchmark problems.

This problem arises in applications such as robotics, control, and preference optimization in language models, where learning a single policy for all $n$ objectives is suboptimal as $n$ grows. We introduce a two-stage procedure -- meta-training followed by fine-tuning -- to address this problem. We first learn a meta-policy for all objectives using multitask learning. Then, we adapt the meta-policy to multiple randomly sampled subsets of objectives. The adaptation step leverages a first-order approximation property of well-trained policy networks, which is empirically verified to be accurate within a $2\\%$ error margin across various RL environments. The resulting algorithm, PolicyGradEx, efficiently estimates an aggregate task-affinity score matrix given a policy evaluation algorithm.

While recent work has explored horizon selection by preserving forecasting-relevant information in an intrinsic space, these approaches are primarily restricted to centralized and independently distributed settings. This paper presents a principled framework for adaptive horizon selection in federated time series forecasting through an intrinsic space formulation. We introduce a synthetic data generator (SDG) that captures essential temporal structures in client data, including autoregressive dependencies, seasonality, and trend, while incorporating client-specific heterogeneity. Building on this model, we define a transformation that maps time series windows into an intrinsic representation space with well-defined geometric and statistical properties. We then derive a decomposition of the forecasting loss into a Bayesian term, which reflects irreducible uncertainty, and an approximation term, which accounts for finite-sample effects and limited model capacity. Our analysis shows that while increasing the look-back horizon improves the identifiability of deterministic patterns, it also increases approximation error due to higher model complexity and reduced sample efficiency. We prove that the total forecasting loss is minimized at the smallest horizon where the irreducible loss starts to saturate, while the approximation loss continues to rise. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for adaptive horizon selection for time series forecasting in federated learning."}

The key mechanism is the Rotational Polarity of Eigenvectors (RPE), a geometric phenomenon in which the leading eigenvectors of the Hessian rotate during training instabilities. These rotations, which increase with learning rates, promote exploration and provably lead to flatter minima.\n  This theoretical framework extends to stochastic GD, where instability-driven flattening persists and its empirical effects outweigh minibatch noise. Finally, we show that restoring instabilities in Adam further improves generalization.\n  Together, these results establish and understand the constructive role of training instabilities in deep learning."}

In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?\n  To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data. These findings extend emergent meta-learning beyond language, pointing toward a unified, modality-agnostic view of in-context learning."}

Our analysis reveals three structural convergence regimes depending on the degree of preference alignment: consensus collapse, compromise on shared optima, and asymmetric refinement. We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: no recursive BT-based curation mechanism can simultaneously preserve diversity, ensure symmetric influence, and eliminate dependence on initialization. Framing the process as dynamic social choice, we show that alignment is not a static goal but an evolving equilibrium, shaped both by power asymmetries and path dependence."}

Our approach requires no additional training, datasets, or prior information, making it immediately integrable with any Langevin-based method.

We propose FedTopo, a framework that integrates Topological-Guided Block Screening (TGBS) and Topological Embedding (TE) to leverage topological information, yielding coherently aligned cross-client representations by Topological Alignment Loss (TAL). First, Topology-Guided Block Screening (TGBS) automatically selects the most topology-informative block, i.e., the one with maximal topological separability, whose persistence-based signatures best distinguish within- versus between-class pairs, ensuring that subsequent analysis focuses on topology-rich features. Next, this block yields a compact Topological Embedding, which quantifies the topological information for each client. Finally, a Topological Alignment Loss (TAL) guides clients to maintain topological consistency with the global model during optimization, reducing representation drift across rounds. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under four non-I.I.D. partitions show that FedTopo accelerates convergence and improves accuracy over strong baselines."}

In this work, we propose a control theoretic framework that treats a trained neural network as a nonlinear state space system and uses local linearization, controllability and observability Gramians, and Hankel singular values to analyze its internal computation. For a given input, we linearize the network around the corresponding hidden activation pattern and construct a state space model whose state consists of hidden neuron activations. The input state and state output Jacobians define local controllability and observability Gramians, from which we compute Hankel singular values and associated modes. These quantities provide a principled notion of neuron and pathway importance: controllability measures how easily each neuron can be excited by input perturbations, observability measures how strongly each neuron influences the output, and Hankel singular values rank internal modes that carry input output energy. We illustrate the framework on simple feedforward networks, including a 1 2 2 1 SwiGLU network and a 2 3 3 2 GELU network. By comparing different operating points, we show how activation saturation reduces controllability, shrinks the dominant Hankel singular value, and shifts the dominant internal mode to a different subset of neurons.

Extending this to multiclass classification has long been challenging, since Natarajan's work in the late 80s proposing the Natarajan dimension (Nat) as a natural analogue of VC. Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014) introduced the DS dimension, later shown by Brukhim et al. (2022) to characterize multiclass learnability. Brukhim et al. also showed that Nat and DS can diverge arbitrarily, suggesting that multiclass learning is governed by DS rather than Nat. We show that agnostic multiclass PAC sample complexity is in fact governed by two distinct dimensions. Specifically, we prove nearly tight agnostic sample complexity bounds that, up to log factors, take the form $\\frac{DS^{1.5}}ε + \\frac{Nat}{ε^2}$ where $ε$ is the excess risk. This bound is tight up to a $\\sqrt{DS}$ factor in the first term, nearly matching known $Nat/ε^2$ and $DS/ε$ lower bounds. The first term reflects the DS-controlled regime, while the second shows that the Natarajan dimension still dictates asymptotic behavior for small $ε$. Thus, unlike binary or online classification -- where a single dimension (VC or Littlestone) controls both phenomena -- multiclass learning inherently involves two structural parameters. Our technical approach departs from traditional agnostic learning methods based on uniform convergence or reductions to realizable cases. A key ingredient is a novel online procedure based on a self-adaptive multiplicative-weights algorithm performing a label-space reduction, which may be of independent interest."}

While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention."}

Within this paradigm, the intellectual property rights (IPR) of client models are critical assets that must be protected. In practice, the central server responsible for maintaining the global model may maliciously manipulate the global model to erase client contributions or falsely claim sole ownership, thereby infringing on clients' IPR. Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique for asserting model ownership and protecting intellectual property. However, existing FL watermarking approaches remain limited, suffering from potential watermark collisions among clients, insufficient watermark security, and non-intuitive verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose FLClear, a novel framework that simultaneously achieves collision-free watermark aggregation, enhanced watermark security, and visually interpretable ownership verification. Specifically, FLClear introduces a transposed model jointly optimized with contrastive learning to integrate the watermarking and main task objectives. During verification, the watermark is reconstructed from the transposed model and evaluated through both visual inspection and structural similarity metrics, enabling intuitive and quantitative ownership verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted over various datasets, aggregation schemes, and attack scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of FLClear and confirm that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL watermarking methods."}

The two examples are Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) using the bound for the marginal and autoencoders using the conditional bound. It is a known result, not only for autoencoders, that minimizing the error between inputs and outputs maximizes the dependence between inputs and the middle.\n  We use Hilbert space and decomposition to address cases where a multiple-output network produces multiple centers defining a Gaussian mixture. Our first finding is that an autoencoder's objective is equivalent to maximizing the trace of a Gaussian operator, the sum of eigenvalues under bases orthonormal w.r.t. the data and model distributions. This suggests that, when a one-to-one correspondence as needed in autoencoders is unnecessary, we can instead maximize the nuclear norm of this operator, the sum of singular values, to maximize overall rank rather than trace. Thus the trace of a Gaussian operator can be used to train autoencoders, and its nuclear norm can be used as divergence to train MDNs.\n  Our second test uses inner products and norms in a Hilbert space to define bounds and costs. Such bounds often have an extra norm compared to KL-based bounds, which increases sample diversity and prevents the trivial solution where a multiple-output network produces the same constant, at the cost of requiring a sample batch to estimate and optimize. We propose an encoder-mixture-decoder architecture whose decoder is multiple-output, producing multiple centers per sample, potentially tightening the bound. Assuming the data are small-variance Gaussian mixtures, this upper bound can be tracked and analyzed quantitatively."}

This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount."}

Magnetic field measurements of solar active regions are converted into structured multivariate time series, enabling predictive modeling across segmented observation windows. However, the inherently imbalanced nature of solar flare occurrences, where intense flares are rare compared to minor flare events, presents a significant barrier to effective learning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Global Cross-Time Attention Fusion (GCTAF) architecture, a transformer-based model to enhance long-range temporal modeling. Unlike traditional self-attention mechanisms that rely solely on local interactions within time series, GCTAF injects a set of learnable cross-attentive global tokens that summarize salient temporal patterns across the entire sequence. These tokens are refined through cross-attention with the input sequence and fused back into the temporal representation, enabling the model to identify globally significant, non-contiguous time points that are critical for flare prediction. This mechanism functions as a dynamic attention-driven temporal summarizer that augments the model's capacity to capture discriminative flare-related dynamics. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark solar flare dataset and show that GCTAF effectively detects intense flares and improves predictive performance, demonstrating that refining transformer-based architectures presents a high-potential alternative for solar flare prediction tasks."}

However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions."}

We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations.

In a targeted data poisoning attack, an adversary manipulates the training dataset to alter the classification of a targeted test point. Given the typically large size of training dataset, manual detection of poisoning is difficult. An alternative is to automatically measure a dataset's robustness against such an attack, which is the focus of this paper. We consider a threat model wherein an adversary can only perturb the labels of the training dataset, with knowledge limited to the hypothesis space of the victim's model. In this setting, we prove that finding the robustness is an NP-Complete problem, even when hypotheses are linear classifiers. To overcome this, we present a technique that finds lower and upper bounds of robustness. Our implementation of the technique computes these bounds efficiently in practice for many publicly available datasets. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, a poisoning exceeding the identified robustness bounds significantly impacts test point classification. We are also able to compute these bounds in many more cases where state-of-the-art techniques fail."}

While one-step Gaussian policies enable fast inference, they struggle to capture complex, multimodal action distributions. Existing flow-based methods improve expressivity but typically rely on distillation and two-stage training when trained with Q-learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose to reformulate MeanFlow to enable direct noise-to-action generation by integrating the velocity field and noise-to-action transformation into a single policy network-eliminating the need for separate velocity estimation. We explore several reformulation variants and identify an effective residual formulation that supports expressive and stable policy learning. Our method offers three key advantages: 1) efficient one-step noise-to-action generation, 2) expressive modelling of multimodal action distributions, and 3) efficient and stable policy learning via Q-learning in a single-stage training setup.

However, intermediate layers contain rich and complementary information -- ranging from low-level patterns to high-level abstractions -- that is often discarded when the decision head depends solely on the last representation. This paper revisits the role of the output layer and introduces LAYA (Layer-wise Attention Aggregator), a novel output head that dynamically aggregates internal representations through attention. Instead of projecting only the deepest embedding, LAYA learns input-conditioned attention weights over layer-wise features, yielding an interpretable and architecture-agnostic mechanism for synthesizing predictions. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that LAYA consistently matches or improves the performance of standard output heads, with relative gains of up to about one percentage point in accuracy, while providing explicit layer-attribution scores that reveal how different abstraction levels contribute to each decision. Crucially, these interpretability signals emerge directly from the model's computation, without any external post hoc explanations.

However, in typical scenarios where the fine-tuning data is limited, e.g., compared to pre-training, SFT can lead LMs to overfit, causing them to rely on spurious patterns within the target task or to compromise other broadly useful capabilities as a side effect of narrow specialization. In this paper, we propose Learning-from-the-Undesirable (LfU), a simple yet effective regularization scheme for SFT to mitigate overfitting issues when fine-tuning LMs with limited data. Specifically, we aim to regularize the fine-tuning process to favor solutions that are resilient to \"undesirable\" model updates, e.g., gradient ascent steps that steer the model toward undesirable behaviors. To this end, we propose a novel form of consistency regularization that directly aligns internal representations of the model with those after an undesirable update. By leveraging representation-level data augmentation through undesirable updates, LfU effectively promotes generalization under limited data. Our experiments on diverse LM downstream tasks show that LfU serves as an effective prior that enhances adaptability while preserving pretrained knowledge. For example, our LM from LfU achieves a 16.8% average improvement on math tasks compared to vanilla SFT on the same dataset, where the latter even leads to degraded performance on those tasks. Furthermore, LfU exhibits improved robustness to prompt variations, e.g., yielding a 92.1% lower standard deviation in output performances compared to SFT, highlighting its versatile effects."}

This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning."}

A Case Study on LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Autonomous Driving", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous vehicle navigation in complex environments such as dense and fast-moving highways and merging scenarios remains an active area of research. A key limitation of RL is its reliance on well-specified reward functions, which often fail to capture the full semantic and social complexity of diverse, out-of-distribution situations. As a result, a rapidly growing line of research explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace or supplement RL for direct planning and control, on account of their ability to reason about rich semantic context. However, LLMs present significant drawbacks: they can be unstable in zero-shot safety-critical settings, produce inconsistent outputs, and often depend on expensive API calls with network latency. This motivates our investigation into whether small, locally deployed LLMs (< 14B parameters) can meaningfully support autonomous highway driving through reward shaping rather than direct control. We present a case study comparing RL-only, LLM-only, and hybrid approaches, where LLMs augment RL rewards by scoring state-action transitions during training, while standard RL policies execute at test time. Our findings reveal that RL-only agents achieve moderate success rates (73-89%) with reasonable efficiency, LLM-only agents can reach higher success rates (up to 94%) but with severely degraded speed performance, and hybrid approaches consistently fall between these extremes. Critically, despite explicit efficiency instructions, LLM-influenced approaches exhibit systematic conservative bias with substantial model-dependent variability, highlighting important limitations of current small LLMs for safety-critical control tasks."}

We introduce GFOES, a novel framework comprising a Generative Feedback Network (GFN) and a two-phase fine-tuning procedure. GFN synthesises Optimal Erasure Samples (OES), which induce high loss on target classes, enabling the model to forget class-specific knowledge without access to the original forget data, while preserving performance on retained classes. The two-phase fine-tuning procedure enables aggressive forgetting in the first phase, followed by utility restoration in the second.

Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate.

These algorithms are widely used in political science, communication, computational social science, and computer science to estimate ideological preferences from parliamentary speeches, party manifestos, and social media. Over the past two decades, their development has closely followed broader NLP trends -- beginning with word-frequency models and most recently turning to large language models (LLMs). While this trajectory has greatly expanded the methodological toolkit, it has also produced a fragmented field that lacks systematic comparison and clear guidance for applied use. To address this gap, we identified 25 CT-IPE algorithms through a systematic literature review and conducted a manual content analysis of their modeling assumptions and development contexts. To compare them meaningfully, we introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes how algorithms generate, capture, and aggregate textual variance. On this basis, we identify four methodological families -- word-frequency, topic modeling, word embedding, and LLM-based approaches -- and critically assess their assumptions, interpretability, scalability, and limitations. Our review offers three contributions. First, it provides a structured synthesis of two decades of algorithm development, clarifying how diverse methods relate to one another. Second, it translates these insights into practical guidance for applied researchers, highlighting trade-offs in transparency, technical requirements, and validation strategies that shape algorithm choice. Third, it emphasizes that differences in estimation outcomes across algorithms are themselves informative, underscoring the need for systematic benchmarking."}

While recent work has explored horizon selection by preserving forecasting-relevant information in an intrinsic space, these approaches are primarily restricted to centralized and independently distributed settings. This paper presents a principled framework for adaptive horizon selection in federated time series forecasting through an intrinsic space formulation. We introduce a synthetic data generator (SDG) that captures essential temporal structures in client data, including autoregressive dependencies, seasonality, and trend, while incorporating client-specific heterogeneity. Building on this model, we define a transformation that maps time series windows into an intrinsic representation space with well-defined geometric and statistical properties. We then derive a decomposition of the forecasting loss into a Bayesian term, which reflects irreducible uncertainty, and an approximation term, which accounts for finite-sample effects and limited model capacity. Our analysis shows that while increasing the look-back horizon improves the identifiability of deterministic patterns, it also increases approximation error due to higher model complexity and reduced sample efficiency. We prove that the total forecasting loss is minimized at the smallest horizon where the irreducible loss starts to saturate, while the approximation loss continues to rise. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for adaptive horizon selection for time series forecasting in federated learning."}

In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?\n  To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data. These findings extend emergent meta-learning beyond language, pointing toward a unified, modality-agnostic view of in-context learning."}

Our analysis reveals three structural convergence regimes depending on the degree of preference alignment: consensus collapse, compromise on shared optima, and asymmetric refinement. We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: no recursive BT-based curation mechanism can simultaneously preserve diversity, ensure symmetric influence, and eliminate dependence on initialization. Framing the process as dynamic social choice, we show that alignment is not a static goal but an evolving equilibrium, shaped both by power asymmetries and path dependence."}

Often this is done with a single model which mimics the original model on average but could struggle in more dynamic situations. A key challenge is that this simpler model should have the right balance be- tween flexibility and complexity or right balance between balance bias and accuracy. We propose a new model-agnostic method to divide the state space into regions where a simplified, human-understandable model can operate in. In this paper, we use Voronoi partitioning to find regions where linear models can achieve similar performance to the original con- troller.

To ground this investigation, we introduce FAITH, a framework designed to systematically probe the strengths and limitations of this KG-based approach. FAITH operates without reference answers by decomposing responses into atomic claims, linking them to a medical KG, and scoring them based on evidence paths. Experiments on diverse medical tasks with human subjective evaluations demonstrate that KG-grounded evaluation achieves considerably higher correlations with clinician judgments and can effectively distinguish LLMs with varying capabilities. It is also robust to textual variances. The inherent explainability of its scoring can further help users understand and mitigate the limitations of current LLMs. We conclude that while limitations exist, leveraging KGs is a prominent direction for automated factuality assessment in healthcare."}

However, the practical behavior of KANs under continual learning remains unclear, and their limitations are not well understood. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of catastrophic forgetting in KANs and develop a theoretical framework that links forgetting to activation support overlap and intrinsic data dimension.

Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors; one player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones, jointly maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number. This cooperative dynamics substantially improves sample quality, making the extremely large spaces tractable. PackingStar reproduces previous configurations and surpasses all human-known records from dimensions 25 to 31, with the configuration in 25 dimensions geometrically corresponding to the Leech lattice and suggesting possible optimality. It achieves the first breakthrough beyond rational structures from 1971 in 13 dimensions and discovers over 6000 new structures in 14 and other dimensions.

Existing models often focus on disentangling and separately modeling spatial and temporal patterns based on relationships between data points.

In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features.

Existing clustering techniques either rely on fixed distance metrics or deep models designed for static data, limiting their ability to handle dynamic, unstructured industrial sequences. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised discovery of operational modes in univariate time-series data using image-based convolutional clustering with composite internal evaluation. The proposed framework improves upon existing approaches in three ways: (1) raw time-series sequences are transformed into grayscale matrix representations via overlapping sliding windows, allowing effective feature extraction using a deep convolutional autoencoder; (2) the framework integrates both soft and hard clustering outputs and refines the selection through a two-stage strategy; and (3) clustering performance is objectively evaluated by a newly developed composite score, S_eva, which combines normalized Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin indices. Applied to over 3900 furnace melting operations from a Nordic foundry, the method identifies seven explainable operational patterns, revealing significant differences in energy consumption, thermal dynamics, and production duration. Compared to classical and deep clustering baselines, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance, greater robustness, and domain-aligned explainability. The framework addresses key challenges in unsupervised time-series analysis, such as sequence irregularity, overlapping modes, and metric inconsistency, and provides a generalizable solution for data-driven diagnostics and energy optimization in industrial systems."}

The first stage is the self-supervised representation learning-based spirogram embedding (SLSE) network training process, where the encoder of the Variational autoencoder (VAE-encoder) learns a robust low-dimensional representation of the spirogram time series from the data-augmented unlabeled data. Second, this low-dimensional representation is fused with demographic information and fed into a CatBoost classifier for the downstream RHF prediction task. Trained and tested on a carefully selected subset of 26,617 individuals from the UK Biobank, our model achieved an AUROC of 0.7501 in detecting RHF, demonstrating strong population-level distinction ability. We further evaluated the model on high-risk clinical subgroups, achieving AUROC values of 0.8194 on a test set of 74 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 0.8413 on a set of 64 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). These results highlight the model's potential utility in predicting RHF among clinically elevated-risk populations. In conclusion, this study presents a self-supervised representation learning approach combining spirogram time series and demographic data, demonstrating promising potential for early RHF detection in clinical practice."}

In this work, we propose a control theoretic framework that treats a trained neural network as a nonlinear state space system and uses local linearization, controllability and observability Gramians, and Hankel singular values to analyze its internal computation. For a given input, we linearize the network around the corresponding hidden activation pattern and construct a state space model whose state consists of hidden neuron activations. The input state and state output Jacobians define local controllability and observability Gramians, from which we compute Hankel singular values and associated modes. These quantities provide a principled notion of neuron and pathway importance: controllability measures how easily each neuron can be excited by input perturbations, observability measures how strongly each neuron influences the output, and Hankel singular values rank internal modes that carry input output energy. We illustrate the framework on simple feedforward networks, including a 1 2 2 1 SwiGLU network and a 2 3 3 2 GELU network. By comparing different operating points, we show how activation saturation reduces controllability, shrinks the dominant Hankel singular value, and shifts the dominant internal mode to a different subset of neurons. The proposed method turns a neural network into a collection of local white box dynamical models and suggests which internal directions are natural candidates for pruning or constraints to improve interpretability."}

However, SR faces two main challenges: most methods are evaluated on scientific datasets with well-understood relationships, limiting generalization, and SR primarily targets single-output regression, whereas many real-world problems involve multi-target outputs with interdependent variables. To address these issues, we propose multi-task regression GINN-LP (MTRGINN-LP), an interpretable neural network for multi-target symbolic regression. By integrating GINN-LP with a multi-task deep learning, the model combines a shared backbone including multiple power-term approximator blocks with task-specific output layers, capturing inter-target dependencies while preserving interpretability. We validate multi-task GINN-LP on practical multi-target applications, including energy efficiency prediction and sustainable agriculture.

While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention."}

We address this issue by conducting an analysis of the information processing capabilities of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance with finite samples. By utilizing the Poisson process and isolating the rate factor, we demonstrate the capability of capturing the pointwise density difference with Wasserstein distances and how this information harmonizes with support differences. The analyzed properties are confirmed using neural spike train decoding and amino acid contact frequency data.

A major computational bottleneck arises in acquisition function optimization, where multi-start optimization (MSO) with quasi-Newton (QN) methods is required due to the non-convexity of the acquisition function. BoTorch, a widely used BO library, currently optimizes the summed acquisition function over multiple points, leading to the speedup of MSO owing to PyTorch batching. Nevertheless, this paper empirically demonstrates the suboptimality of this approach in terms of off-diagonal approximation errors in the inverse Hessian of a QN method, slowing down its convergence. To address this problem, we propose to decouple QN updates using a coroutine while batching the acquisition function calls. Our approach not only yields the theoretically identical convergence to the sequential MSO but also drastically reduces the wall-clock time compared to the previous approaches."}

This dependence on solver-based data limits scalability and constrains exploration across physical systems. Here we introduce the Method of Manufactured Learning (MML), a solver-independent framework for training neural operators using analytically constructed, physics-consistent datasets. Inspired by the classical method of manufactured solutions, MML replaces numerical data generation with functional synthesis, i.e., smooth candidate solutions are sampled from controlled analytical spaces, and the corresponding forcing fields are derived by direct application of the governing differential operators. During inference, setting these forcing terms to zero restores the original governing equations, allowing the trained neural operator to emulate the true solution operator of the system. The framework is agnostic to network architecture and can be integrated with any operator learning paradigm. In this paper, we employ Fourier neural operator as a representative example. Across canonical benchmarks including heat, advection, Burgers, and diffusion-reaction equations. MML achieves high spectral accuracy, low residual errors, and strong generalization to unseen conditions. By reframing data generation as a process of analytical synthesis, MML offers a scalable, solver-agnostic pathway toward constructing physically grounded neural operators that retain fidelity to governing laws without reliance on expensive numerical simulations or costly experimental data for training."}

These discrepancies pose fundamental challenges in characterizing and evaluating the utility of mixed real-synthetic datasets. In this paper, we identify a three-phase scaling behavior characterized by two breakpoints that reflect transitions in model behavior across learning head and tail knowledge. We further derive an LLM generalization bound designed for real and synthetic mixtures, revealing several key factors that govern their generalization performance. Building on our theoretical findings, we propose an effective yet efficient data valuation method that scales to large-scale datasets.

We train models to have more understandable circuits by constraining most of their weights to be zeros, so that each neuron only has a few connections. To recover fine-grained circuits underlying each of several hand-crafted tasks, we prune the models to isolate the part responsible for the task. These circuits often contain neurons and residual channels that correspond to natural concepts, with a small number of straightforwardly interpretable connections between them. We study how these models scale and find that making weights sparser trades off capability for interpretability, and scaling model size improves the capability-interpretability frontier. However, scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge. In addition to training weight-sparse models de novo, we show preliminary results suggesting our method can also be adapted to explain existing dense models.

The two examples are Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) using the bound for the marginal and autoencoders using the conditional bound. It is a known result, not only for autoencoders, that minimizing the error between inputs and outputs maximizes the dependence between inputs and the middle.\n  We use Hilbert space and decomposition to address cases where a multiple-output network produces multiple centers defining a Gaussian mixture. Our first finding is that an autoencoder's objective is equivalent to maximizing the trace of a Gaussian operator, the sum of eigenvalues under bases orthonormal w.r.t. the data and model distributions. This suggests that, when a one-to-one correspondence as needed in autoencoders is unnecessary, we can instead maximize the nuclear norm of this operator, the sum of singular values, to maximize overall rank rather than trace. Thus the trace of a Gaussian operator can be used to train autoencoders, and its nuclear norm can be used as divergence to train MDNs.\n  Our second test uses inner products and norms in a Hilbert space to define bounds and costs. Such bounds often have an extra norm compared to KL-based bounds, which increases sample diversity and prevents the trivial solution where a multiple-output network produces the same constant, at the cost of requiring a sample batch to estimate and optimize. We propose an encoder-mixture-decoder architecture whose decoder is multiple-output, producing multiple centers per sample, potentially tightening the bound. Assuming the data are small-variance Gaussian mixtures, this upper bound can be tracked and analyzed quantitatively."}

This design introduces inherent bottlenecks, including redundant computations of identical users/items and increased latency due to strictly sequential operations, which jointly constrain the model's capacity and system efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Asynchronous Inference Framework (AIF), a cost-effective computational architecture that decouples interaction-independent components, those operating within a single user or item, from real-time prediction. AIF reorganizes the model inference process by performing user-side computations in parallel with the retrieval stage and conducting item-side computations in a nearline manner. This means that interaction-independent components are calculated just once and completed before the real-time prediction phase of the pre-ranking stage. As a result, AIF enhances computational efficiency and reduces latency, freeing up resources to significantly improve the feature set and model architecture of interaction-independent components. Moreover, we delve into model design within the AIF framework, employing approximated methods for interaction-dependent components in online real-time predictions. By co-designing both the framework and the model, our solution achieves notable performance gains without significantly increasing computational and latency costs.

This paper investigates the role of explainable AI (XAI) in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and actionable insight for extreme event forecasting. Using wildfire prediction as a case study, we evaluate various AI models and employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior.

To address these limitations, we propose Affine Prototype Timestamp (APT), a lightweight and flexible plug-in module that injects global distribution features into the normalization-forecasting pipeline. By leveraging timestamp conditioned prototype learning, APT dynamically generates affine parameters that modulate both input and output series, enabling the backbone to learn from self-supervised, distribution-aware clustered instances. APT is compatible with arbitrary forecasting backbones and normalization strategies while introducing minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets and multiple backbone-normalization combinations demonstrate that APT significantly improves forecasting performance under distribution shift."}

Accurate anomaly detection and early risk forecasting in financial time series are therefore crucial for preventing systemic instability and supporting informed investment decisions. Traditional deep learning models, such as LSTM and GRU, often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex periodic patterns in highly nonstationary financial data. To address this limitation, this study proposes a FEDformer-Based Hybrid Framework for Anomaly Detection and Risk Forecasting in Financial Time Series, which integrates the Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer (FEDformer) with a residual-based anomaly detector and a risk forecasting head. The FEDformer module models temporal dynamics in both time and frequency domains, decomposing signals into trend and seasonal components for improved interpretability. The residual-based detector identifies abnormal fluctuations by analyzing prediction errors, while the risk head predicts potential financial distress using learned latent embeddings.

Magnetic field measurements of solar active regions are converted into structured multivariate time series, enabling predictive modeling across segmented observation windows. However, the inherently imbalanced nature of solar flare occurrences, where intense flares are rare compared to minor flare events, presents a significant barrier to effective learning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Global Cross-Time Attention Fusion (GCTAF) architecture, a transformer-based model to enhance long-range temporal modeling. Unlike traditional self-attention mechanisms that rely solely on local interactions within time series, GCTAF injects a set of learnable cross-attentive global tokens that summarize salient temporal patterns across the entire sequence. These tokens are refined through cross-attention with the input sequence and fused back into the temporal representation, enabling the model to identify globally significant, non-contiguous time points that are critical for flare prediction. This mechanism functions as a dynamic attention-driven temporal summarizer that augments the model's capacity to capture discriminative flare-related dynamics. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark solar flare dataset and show that GCTAF effectively detects intense flares and improves predictive performance, demonstrating that refining transformer-based architectures presents a high-potential alternative for solar flare prediction tasks."}

In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack that explicitly leverages the geometric properties of hyperbolic space. Specifically, we compute the gradient of the loss function in the tangent space of hyperbolic space, decompose it into a radial (depth) component and an angular (semantic) component, and apply perturbation derived solely from the angular direction. Our method generates adversarial examples by focusing perturbations in semantically sensitive directions encoded in angular movement within the hyperbolic geometry. Empirical results on image classification, cross-modal retrieval tasks and network architectures demonstrate that our attack achieves higher fooling rates than conventional adversarial attacks, while producing high-impact perturbations with deeper insights into vulnerabilities of hyperbolic embeddings. This work highlights the importance of geometry-aware adversarial strategies in curved representation spaces and provides a principled framework for attacking hierarchical embeddings."}

We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose to reformulate MeanFlow to enable direct noise-to-action generation by integrating the velocity field and noise-to-action transformation into a single policy network-eliminating the need for separate velocity estimation. We explore several reformulation variants and identify an effective residual formulation that supports expressive and stable policy learning. Our method offers three key advantages: 1) efficient one-step noise-to-action generation, 2) expressive modelling of multimodal action distributions, and 3) efficient and stable policy learning via Q-learning in a single-stage training setup.

To overcome this challenge, the research community is looking more and more at Graph Machine Learning (GML) as it offers a powerful alternative by using relationships within data. However, this method also faces limitations, particularly when dealing with Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which can hide huge information due to their semantic nature. This study introduces Bi-View, a novel hybrid approach that increases the informative content of node features in KGs to generate enhanced Graph Embeddings (GEs) that are used to improve GML models without relying on additional synthetic data. The proposed work combines two complementary GE techniques: Node2Vec, which captures structural patterns through unsupervised random walks, and GraphSAGE, which aggregates neighbourhood information in a supervised way. Node2Vec embeddings are first computed to represent the graph topology, and node features are then enriched with centrality-based metrics, which are used as input for the GraphSAGE model. Moreover, a fusion layer combines the original Node2Vec embeddings with the GraphSAGE-influenced representations, resulting in a dual-perspective embedding space. Such a fusion captures both topological and semantic properties of the graph, enabling the model to exploit informative features that may exist in the dataset but that are not explicitly represented. Our approach improves downstream task performance, especially in scenarios with poor initial features, giving the basis for more accurate and precise KG-enanched GML models."}

However, in typical scenarios where the fine-tuning data is limited, e.g., compared to pre-training, SFT can lead LMs to overfit, causing them to rely on spurious patterns within the target task or to compromise other broadly useful capabilities as a side effect of narrow specialization. In this paper, we propose Learning-from-the-Undesirable (LfU), a simple yet effective regularization scheme for SFT to mitigate overfitting issues when fine-tuning LMs with limited data. Specifically, we aim to regularize the fine-tuning process to favor solutions that are resilient to \"undesirable\" model updates, e.g., gradient ascent steps that steer the model toward undesirable behaviors. To this end, we propose a novel form of consistency regularization that directly aligns internal representations of the model with those after an undesirable update. By leveraging representation-level data augmentation through undesirable updates, LfU effectively promotes generalization under limited data. Our experiments on diverse LM downstream tasks show that LfU serves as an effective prior that enhances adaptability while preserving pretrained knowledge. For example, our LM from LfU achieves a 16.8% average improvement on math tasks compared to vanilla SFT on the same dataset, where the latter even leads to degraded performance on those tasks. Furthermore, LfU exhibits improved robustness to prompt variations, e.g., yielding a 92.1% lower standard deviation in output performances compared to SFT, highlighting its versatile effects."}

We address this gap by conducting a geometric analysis of the network's energy landscape. We introduce a novel metric, ``Pinnacle Sharpness,'' to quantify the local stability of attractors. By systematically varying the kernel width and storage load, we uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor shapes. Our central finding is the emergence of a ``ridge of optimization,'' where the network maximizes attractor stability under challenging high-load and global-kernel conditions. Through a theoretical decomposition of the landscape gradient into a direct ``driving'' force and an indirect ``feedback'' force, we reveal the origin of this phenomenon. The optimization ridge corresponds to a regime of strong anti-correlation between the two forces, where the direct force, amplified by the high storage load, dominates the opposing collective feedback force. This demonstrates a sophisticated self-organization mechanism: the network adaptively harnesses inter-pattern interactions as a cooperative feedback control system to sculpt a robust energy landscape. Our findings provide a new physical picture for the stability of high-capacity associative memories and offer principles for their design."}

This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning."}

While direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy demonstrates promising performance in detecting cancer lesions, its practical application is limited by prolonged procedure times and high costs. To overcome these issues, an indirect MRI-guided biopsy that allows the procedure to be performed outside of the MRI room has been proposed, but it still faces challenges in creating an accurate real-time deformable breast model. In our study, we tackled this issue by developing a graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting deformed breast cancer sites in real time during biopsy procedures. An individual-specific finite element (FE) model was developed by incorporating magnetic resonance (MR) image-derived structural information of the breast and tumor to simulate deformation behaviors. A GNN model was then employed, designed to process surface displacement and distance-based graph data, enabling accurate prediction of overall tissue displacement, including the deformation of the tumor region. The model was validated using phantom and real patient datasets, achieving an accuracy within 0.2 millimeters (mm) for cancer node displacement (RMSE) and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 for spatial overlap with actual cancerous regions. Additionally, the model enabled real-time inference and achieved a speed-up of over 4,000 times in computational cost compared to conventional FE simulations.

First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems."}

We introduce GFOES, a novel framework comprising a Generative Feedback Network (GFN) and a two-phase fine-tuning procedure. GFN synthesises Optimal Erasure Samples (OES), which induce high loss on target classes, enabling the model to forget class-specific knowledge without access to the original forget data, while preserving performance on retained classes. The two-phase fine-tuning procedure enables aggressive forgetting in the first phase, followed by utility restoration in the second. Experiments on three image classification datasets demonstrate that GFOES achieves effective forgetting at both logit and representation levels, while maintaining strong performance using only 5% of the original data. Our framework offers a practical and scalable solution for privacy-preserving machine learning under data-constrained conditions."}

However, a major bottleneck in this task is the unpaired nature of single-cell data, as the same cell cannot be observed both before and after perturbation due to the destructive nature of sequencing. Although some neural generative transport models attempt to tackle unpaired single-cell perturbation data, they either lack explicit conditioning or depend on prior spaces for indirect distribution alignment, limiting precise perturbation modeling. In this work, we approximate Schrödinger Bridge (SB), which defines stochastic dynamic mappings recovering the entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT), to directly align the distributions of control and perturbed single-cell populations across different perturbation conditions. Unlike prior SB approximations that rely on bidirectional modeling to infer optimal source-target sample coupling, we leverage Minibatch-OT based pairing to avoid such bidirectional inference and the associated ill-posedness of defining the reverse process. This pairing directly guides bridge learning, yielding a scalable approximation to the SB. We approximate two SB models, one modeling discrete gene activation states and the other continuous expression distributions. Joint training enables accurate perturbation modeling and captures single-cell heterogeneity. Experiments on public genetic and drug perturbation datasets show that our model effectively captures heterogeneous single-cell responses and achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate.

To enable adaptive sparsity evolution throughout training, we further incorporate an asymmetric cosine annealing schedule to continuously update the threshold. Experimental results on the Meta-World benchmark show that SoCo-DT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 7.6% on MT50 and by 10.5% on the suboptimal dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating gradient conflicts and improving overall multi-task performance."}

In personalized FL, the goal shifts from training a single global model to creating tailored models for each client. In our framework, clients transmit highly compressed one-bit sketches, and the server aggregates and broadcasts a global one-bit consensus. To enable effective personalization, we introduce a sign-based regularizer that guides local models to align with the global consensus while preserving local data characteristics. To mitigate the computational burden of random sketching, we employ the Fast Hadamard Transform for efficient projection.

Despite this, conventional quantization suffers from its structural limitation that hinders flexibility during the fine-tuning and deployment stages. Practical on-device tasks demand different quantization precisions (i.e. different bit-widths), e.g., understanding tasks tend to exhibit higher tolerance to reduced precision compared to generation tasks. Conventional quantization, typically relying on scaling factors that are incompatible across bit-widths, fails to support the on-device switching of precisions when confronted with complex real-world scenarios. To overcome the dilemma, we propose OTARo, a novel method that enables on-device LLMs to flexibly switch quantization precisions while maintaining performance robustness through once fine-tuning. OTARo introduces Shared Exponent Floating Point (SEFP), a distinct quantization mechanism, to produce different bit-widths through simple mantissa truncations of a single model. Moreover, to achieve bit-width robustness in downstream applications, OTARo performs a learning process toward losses induced by different bit-widths. The method involves two critical strategies: (1) Exploitation-Exploration Bit-Width Path Search (BPS), which iteratively updates the search path via a designed scoring mechanism; (2) Low-Precision Asynchronous Accumulation (LAA), which performs asynchronous gradient accumulations and delayed updates under low bit-widths. Experiments on popular LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, LLaMA3-8B, demonstrate that OTARo achieves consistently strong and robust performance for all precisions."}

This paper proposes a Physics-informed Neural Operator (PINO) to predict z and y-direction distortion for the future 15 s. Our method, Physics-informed Deep Operator Network-Recurrent Neural Network (PIDeepONet-RNN) employs trunk and branch network to process temperature history and encode distortion fields, respectively, enabling decoupling of thermo-mechanical responses. By incorporating the heat conduction equation as a soft constraint, the model ensures physical consistency and suppresses unphysical artifacts, thereby establishing a more physically consistent mapping between the thermal history and distortion. This is important because such a basis function, grounded in physical laws, provides a robust and interpretable foundation for predictions. The proposed models are trained and tested using datasets generated from experimentally validated Finite Element Method (FEM). Evaluation shows that the model achieves high accuracy, low error accumulation, time efficiency. The max absolute errors in the z and y-directions are as low as 0.9733 mm and 0.2049 mm, respectively. The error distribution shows high errors in the molten pool but low gradient norms in the deposited and key areas.

To address these challenges, we propose DiffFP, a fictitious play (FP) framework that estimates the best response to unseen opponents while learning a robust and multimodal behavioral policy. Specifically, we approximate the best response using a diffusion policy that leverages generative modeling to learn adaptive and diverse strategies. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed FP framework converges towards $ε$-Nash equilibria in continuous- space zero-sum games. We validate our method on complex multi-agent environments, including racing and multi-particle zero-sum games.

ParaDySe enables on-the-fly optimal strategy adoption according to the immediate input sequence. It first implements the modular function libraries for parallel strategies with unified tensor layout specifications, and then builds sequence-aware memory and time cost models with hybrid methods. Guided by cost models, ParaDySe selects optimal layer-wise strategies for dynamic sequences via an efficient heuristic algorithm. By integrating these techniques together, ParaDySe achieves seamless hot-switching of optimal strategies through its well-designed function libraries.

Existing long-to-short (Long2Short) methods aim to reduce inference length but often sacrifice accuracy, revealing a need for an approach that maintains performance while lowering token costs. To address this efficiency-accuracy tradeoff, we propose TokenSqueeze, a novel Long2Short method that condenses reasoning paths while preserving performance and relying exclusively on self-generated data. First, to prevent performance degradation caused by excessive compression of reasoning depth, we propose to select self-generated samples whose reasoning depth is adaptively matched to the complexity of the problem. To further optimize the linguistic expression without altering the underlying reasoning paths, we introduce a distribution-aligned linguistic refinement method that enhances the clarity and conciseness of the reasoning path while preserving its logical integrity. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSqueeze in reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy.

To address this gap, we identified 25 CT-IPE algorithms through a systematic literature review and conducted a manual content analysis of their modeling assumptions and development contexts. To compare them meaningfully, we introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes how algorithms generate, capture, and aggregate textual variance. On this basis, we identify four methodological families -- word-frequency, topic modeling, word embedding, and LLM-based approaches -- and critically assess their assumptions, interpretability, scalability, and limitations.

Such tasks can involve sequential interaction, requiring coherent updating of beliefs in light of new evidence, and making appropriate decisions based on those beliefs. Predicting how LLMs will perform in such dynamic environments is important, but can be tricky to determine from measurements in static settings. In this work, we examine two critical components of LLM performance: the ability of LLMs to coherently update their beliefs, and the extent to which the actions they take are consistent with those beliefs. First, we find that LLMs are largely inconsistent in how they update their beliefs; models can exhibit up to a 30% average difference between the directly elicited posterior, and the correct update of their prior. Second, we find that LLMs also often take actions which are inconsistent with the beliefs they hold. On a betting market, for example, LLMs often do not even bet in the same direction as their internally held beliefs over the underlying outcomes. We also find they have moderate self-inconsistency in how they respond to challenges by users to given answers. Finally, we show that the above properties hold even for strong models that obtain high accuracy or that are well-calibrated on the tasks at hand.

Finally, post-hoc per-label temperature scaling plus per-label thresholds substantially improves micro-F1 and expected calibration error (ECE) with negligible AUC change, and light label-correlation smoothing yields small additional gains.

However, deep RL algorithms train a deep neural network, that lacks transparency, which poses challenges when the controller has to meet regulations, or foster trust. To alleviate this, one could transfer the learned behaviour into a model that is human-readable by design using knowledge distilla- tion. Often this is done with a single model which mimics the original model on average but could struggle in more dynamic situations. A key challenge is that this simpler model should have the right balance be- tween flexibility and complexity or right balance between balance bias and accuracy. We propose a new model-agnostic method to divide the state space into regions where a simplified, human-understandable model can operate in. In this paper, we use Voronoi partitioning to find regions where linear models can achieve similar performance to the original con- troller. We evaluate our approach on a gridworld environment and a classic control task. We observe that our proposed distillation to locally- specialized linear models produces policies that are explainable and show that the distillation matches or even slightly outperforms the black-box policy they are distilled from."}

Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization."}

Here, we proposed a simple yet robust approach for statistically accurate generative prediction of rock discontinuities by utilizing a tabular foundation model. By leveraging the powerful sample learning capability of the foundation model specifically designed for small data, our approach can effectively capture the underlying complex distribution patterns within limited measured discontinuities. Comparative experiments on ten datasets with diverse scales and distribution patterns of discontinuities demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness over conventional statistical models and deep generative approaches.

Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors; one player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones, jointly maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number.

In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework.

This paper presents a theoretical analysis of how a common workaround, training for multiple epochs on the same dataset, reshapes the data scaling laws in linear regression. Concretely, we ask: to match the performance of training on a dataset of size $N$ for $K$ epochs, how much larger must a dataset be if the model is trained for only one pass? We quantify this using the \\textit{effective reuse rate} of the data, $E(K, N)$, which we define as the multiplicative factor by which the dataset must grow under one-pass training to achieve the same test loss as $K$-epoch training. Our analysis precisely characterizes the scaling behavior of $E(K, N)$ for SGD in linear regression under either strong convexity or Zipf-distributed data: (1) When $K$ is small, we prove that $E(K, N) \\approx K$, indicating that every new epoch yields a linear gain; (2) As $K$ increases, $E(K, N)$ plateaus at a problem-dependent value that grows with $N$ ($Θ(\\log N)$ for the strongly-convex case), implying that larger datasets can be repeated more times before the marginal benefit vanishes. These theoretical findings point out a neglected factor in a recent empirical study (Muennighoff et al. (2023)), which claimed that training LLMs for up to $4$ epochs results in negligible loss differences compared to using fresh data at each step, \\textit{i.e.}, $E(K, N) \\approx K$ for $K \\le 4$ in our notation. Supported by further empirical validation with LLMs, our results reveal that the maximum $K$ value for which $E(K, N) \\approx K$ in fact depends on the data size and distribution, and underscore the need to explicitly model both factors in future studies of scaling laws with data reuse."}

Existing clustering techniques either rely on fixed distance metrics or deep models designed for static data, limiting their ability to handle dynamic, unstructured industrial sequences. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised discovery of operational modes in univariate time-series data using image-based convolutional clustering with composite internal evaluation. The proposed framework improves upon existing approaches in three ways: (1) raw time-series sequences are transformed into grayscale matrix representations via overlapping sliding windows, allowing effective feature extraction using a deep convolutional autoencoder; (2) the framework integrates both soft and hard clustering outputs and refines the selection through a two-stage strategy; and (3) clustering performance is objectively evaluated by a newly developed composite score, S_eva, which combines normalized Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin indices. Applied to over 3900 furnace melting operations from a Nordic foundry, the method identifies seven explainable operational patterns, revealing significant differences in energy consumption, thermal dynamics, and production duration. Compared to classical and deep clustering baselines, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance, greater robustness, and domain-aligned explainability. The framework addresses key challenges in unsupervised time-series analysis, such as sequence irregularity, overlapping modes, and metric inconsistency, and provides a generalizable solution for data-driven diagnostics and energy optimization in industrial systems."}

Lung disease often causes increased right ventricular load, leading to RHF. Therefore, it is very important to screen out patients with cor pulmonale who develop RHF from people with underlying lung diseases. In this work, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method to early detecting RHF from patients with cor pulmonale, which uses spirogram time series to predict patients with RHF at an early stage. The proposed model is divided into two stages. The first stage is the self-supervised representation learning-based spirogram embedding (SLSE) network training process, where the encoder of the Variational autoencoder (VAE-encoder) learns a robust low-dimensional representation of the spirogram time series from the data-augmented unlabeled data. Second, this low-dimensional representation is fused with demographic information and fed into a CatBoost classifier for the downstream RHF prediction task. Trained and tested on a carefully selected subset of 26,617 individuals from the UK Biobank, our model achieved an AUROC of 0.7501 in detecting RHF, demonstrating strong population-level distinction ability. We further evaluated the model on high-risk clinical subgroups, achieving AUROC values of 0.8194 on a test set of 74 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 0.8413 on a set of 64 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). These results highlight the model's potential utility in predicting RHF among clinically elevated-risk populations. In conclusion, this study presents a self-supervised representation learning approach combining spirogram time series and demographic data, demonstrating promising potential for early RHF detection in clinical practice."}

In this paper, we introduce Generalizable Representation Enhancement via Auxiliary Transformations (GREAT), a framework that effectively augments available datasets to improve predictions in completely unseen regions. GREAT guides the augmentation process to ensure that the original governing processes can be recovered from the augmented data, and the inclusion of the augmented data leads to improved model generalization. Specifically, GREAT learns transformation functions at multiple layers of neural networks to augment both raw environmental features and temporal influence. They are refined through a novel bi-level training process that constrains augmented data to preserve key patterns of the original source data. We demonstrate GREAT's effectiveness on stream temperature prediction across six ecologically diverse watersheds in the eastern U.S., each containing multiple stream segments. Experimental results show that GREAT significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot scenarios.

We implement this paradigm on a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer, encoding images as quantum states. In situ contrastive pretraining on hardware yields a representation that, when fine-tuned, classifies image families with higher mean test accuracy and lower run-to-run variability than models trained from random initialization. Performance improvement is especially significant in regimes with limited labeled training data. We show that the learned invariances generalize beyond the pretraining image samples. Unlike prior work, our pipeline derives similarity from measured quantum overlaps and executes all training and classification stages on hardware. These results establish a label-efficient route to quantum representation learning, with direct relevance to quantum-native datasets and a clear path to larger classical inputs."}

To address this, we propose a novel quantum physics-based ``white box'' method that offers both accurate uncertainty quantification and enhanced interpretability.

This formulation substantially reduces annotation cost, simplifies training, and allows flexible patch sizing aligned with the desired level of decision granularity. In this work, we focus on a special case, patch-wise binary classification, applied to the detection of a single class of interest (tumor) on high-resolution multimodal nonlinear microscopy images. We show that, although this simplified formulation enables efficient model development, it can introduce spurious correlations between patch composition and labels: tumor patches tend to contain larger tissue regions, whereas non-tumor patches often consist mostly of background with small tissue areas. We further quantify the bias in model predictions caused by this spurious correlation, and propose to use a debiasing strategy to mitigate its effect. Specifically, we apply GERNE, a debiasing method that can be adapted to maximize worst-group accuracy (WGA). Our results show an improvement in WGA by approximately 7% compared to ERM for two different thresholds used to binarize the spurious feature. This enhancement boosts model performance on critical minority cases, such as tumor patches with small tissues and non-tumor patches with large tissues, and underscores the importance of spurious correlation-aware learning in patch-wise classification problems."}

To this end, this paper introduces a novel fair graph learning framework that mitigates bias in graph learning under limited demographic information. Specifically, we propose a mechanism guided by partial demographic data to generate proxies for demographic information and design a strategy that enforces consistent node embeddings across demographic groups. In addition, we develop an adaptive confidence strategy that dynamically adjusts each node's contribution to fairness and utility based on prediction confidence. We further provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our framework, FairGLite, achieves provable upper bounds on group fairness metrics, offering formal guarantees for bias mitigation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and fair graph learning frameworks, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in both mitigating bias and maintaining model utility."}

Existing methods are typically optimized to capture features within the in-distribution (ID) data and calculate OOD scores, which often limits pre-trained models from representing distributional boundaries, leading to unreliable OOD detection. Moreover, the latent structure of graph data is often governed by multiple underlying factors, which remains less explored. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time graph OOD detection method, termed BaCa, that calibrates OOD scores using dual dynamically updated dictionaries without requiring fine-tuning the pre-trained model. Specifically, BaCa estimates graphons and applies a mix-up strategy solely with test samples to generate diverse boundary-aware discriminative topologies, eliminating the need for exposing auxiliary datasets as outliers. We construct dual dynamic dictionaries via priority queues and attention mechanisms to adaptively capture latent ID and OOD representations, which are then utilized for boundary-aware OOD score calibration. To the best of our knowledge, extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that BaCa significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in OOD detection."}

To this end, we propose a novel framework, Reliability-Aware Contrastive Deep Multi-View Clustering (RAC-DMVC), which constructs a reliability graph to guide robust representation learning under noisy environments. Specifically, to address observation noise, we introduce a cross-view reconstruction to enhances robustness at the data level, and a reliability-aware noise contrastive learning to mitigates bias in positive and negative pairs selection caused by noisy representations. To handle missing noise, we design a dual-attention imputation to capture shared information across views while preserving view-specific features. In addition, a self-supervised cluster distillation module further refines the learned representations and improves the clustering performance. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that RAC-DMVC outperforms SOTA methods on multiple evaluation metrics and maintains excellent performance under varying ratios of noise."}

A major computational bottleneck arises in acquisition function optimization, where multi-start optimization (MSO) with quasi-Newton (QN) methods is required due to the non-convexity of the acquisition function. BoTorch, a widely used BO library, currently optimizes the summed acquisition function over multiple points, leading to the speedup of MSO owing to PyTorch batching. Nevertheless, this paper empirically demonstrates the suboptimality of this approach in terms of off-diagonal approximation errors in the inverse Hessian of a QN method, slowing down its convergence. To address this problem, we propose to decouple QN updates using a coroutine while batching the acquisition function calls. Our approach not only yields the theoretically identical convergence to the sequential MSO but also drastically reduces the wall-clock time compared to the previous approaches."}

These discrepancies pose fundamental challenges in characterizing and evaluating the utility of mixed real-synthetic datasets. In this paper, we identify a three-phase scaling behavior characterized by two breakpoints that reflect transitions in model behavior across learning head and tail knowledge. We further derive an LLM generalization bound designed for real and synthetic mixtures, revealing several key factors that govern their generalization performance. Building on our theoretical findings, we propose an effective yet efficient data valuation method that scales to large-scale datasets.

We train models to have more understandable circuits by constraining most of their weights to be zeros, so that each neuron only has a few connections.

These circuits often contain neurons and residual channels that correspond to natural concepts, with a small number of straightforwardly interpretable connections between them. We study how these models scale and find that making weights sparser trades off capability for interpretability, and scaling model size improves the capability-interpretability frontier. However, scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge. In addition to training weight-sparse models de novo, we show preliminary results suggesting our method can also be adapted to explain existing dense models. Our work produces circuits that achieve an unprecedented level of human understandability and validates them with considerable rigor."}

We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\\%$. In contrast, for query-based attacks, increasing the learning rate consistently leads to improved robustness by up to $28\\%$ across various settings and data distributions. Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the optimization hyperparameter design space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks.

Incomplete knowledge of nonlinear interactions and stochastic effects often renders bottom-up modeling approaches ineffective, motivating the development of methods that can discover governing equations directly from data. In such contexts, parametric models often struggle without strong prior knowledge, especially when estimating intrinsic noise. Nonetheless, incorporating stochastic effects is often essential for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems such as gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce Trine (Three-phase Regression for INtrinsic noisE), a nonparametric, kernel-based framework that infers state-dependent intrinsic noise from time-series data. Trine features a three-stage algorithm that com- bines analytically solvable subproblems with a structured kernel architecture that captures both abrupt noise-driven fluctuations and smooth, state-dependent changes in variance. We validate Trine on biological and ecological systems, demonstrating its ability to uncover hidden dynamics without relying on predefined parametric assumptions. Across several benchmark problems, Trine achieves performance comparable to that of an oracle. Biologically, this oracle can be viewed as an idealized observer capable of directly tracking the random fluctuations in molecular concentrations or reaction events within a cell. The Trine framework thus opens new avenues for understanding how intrinsic noise affects the behavior of complex systems."}

This paper investigates the role of explainable AI (XAI) in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and actionable insight for extreme event forecasting. Using wildfire prediction as a case study, we evaluate various AI models and employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior. Our analysis demonstrates how XAI not only clarifies model reasoning but also supports critical decision-making by domain experts and response teams. In addition, we provide supporting visualizations that enhance the interpretability of XAI outputs by contextualizing feature importance and temporal patterns in seasonality and geospatial characteristics. This approach enhances the usability of AI explanations for practitioners and policymakers.

If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings."}

Current methods lack the adaptive policies needed to dynamically debug queries based on real-time execution feedback. This paper introduces a novel agentic framework where an LLM learns a resilient policy for the sequential process of iterative SPARQL construction. We show that a compact 3B-parameter model, trained exclusively via outcome-driven Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) without supervised fine-tuning, can learn effective policies for this task, discovering how to systematically recover from execution errors and refine its queries toward a correct answer. On a curated, executable single-answer subset of LC-QuAD 2.0, our agent achieves 49.7\\% accuracy post-entity-linking, a significant 17.5 percentage point improvement over the strongest iterative zero-shot baseline. Further analysis reveals that while the agent's capability is driven by RL, its performance is enhanced by an explicit deliberative reasoning step that acts as a cognitive scaffold to improve policy precision. This work presents a generalizable blueprint for teaching agents to master formal, symbolic tools through interaction, bridging the gap between probabilistic LLMs and the structured world of Knowledge Graphs."}

Yet, the concept of intelligence remains elusive- lacking a stable definition and failing to predict performance on practical tasks such as question answering, summarization, or coding. Optimizing for such benchmarks risks misaligning evaluation with real-world utility. Our perspective is that evaluation should be grounded in generality rather than abstract notions of intelligence. We identify three assumptions that often underpin intelligence-focused evaluation: generality, stability, and realism. Through conceptual and formal analysis, we show that only generality withstands conceptual and empirical scrutiny. Intelligence is not what enables generality; generality is best understood as a multitask learning problem that directly links evaluation to measurable performance breadth and reliability. This perspective reframes how progress in AI should be assessed and proposes generality as a more stable foundation for evaluating capability across diverse and evolving tasks."}

However, this makes the visual perception module a bottleneck, which constrains the overall capabilities of LVLMs. Conventional evaluation benchmarks, while rich in visual semantics, often contain unavoidable local shortcuts that can lead to an overestimation of models' perceptual abilities. Here, we introduce TopoPerception, a benchmark that leverages topological properties to rigorously evaluate the global visual perception capabilities of LVLMs across various granularities. Since topology depends on the global structure of an image and is invariant to local features, TopoPerception enables a shortcut-free assessment of global perception, fundamentally distinguishing it from semantically rich tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on TopoPerception and find that even at the coarsest perceptual granularity, all models perform no better than random chance, indicating a profound inability to perceive global visual features. Notably, a consistent trend emerge within model families: more powerful models with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit lower accuracy. This suggests that merely scaling up models is insufficient to address this deficit and may even exacerbate it. Progress may require new training paradigms or architectures. TopoPerception not only exposes a critical bottleneck in current LVLMs but also offers a lens and direction for improving their global visual perception.

Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) should help us handle these climate challenges but its most promising solutions are not good at dealing with climate-disrupted data; specifically, machine learning methods that work from historical data-distributions, are not good at handling out-of-distribution, outlier events. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method, that treats the predictive problems around climate change as being, in part, due to class-imbalance issues; that is, prediction from historical datasets is difficult because, by definition, they lack sufficient minority-class instances of \"climate outlier events\". This novel data augmentation method -- called Counterfactual-Based SMOTE (CFA-SMOTE) -- combines an instance-based counterfactual method from Explainable AI (XAI) with the well-known class-imbalance method, SMOTE. CFA-SMOTE creates synthetic data-points representing outlier, climate-events that augment the dataset to improve predictive performance. We report comparative experiments using this CFA-SMOTE method, comparing it to benchmark counterfactual and class-imbalance methods under different conditions (i.e., class-imbalance ratios).

At its core is a two-phase learning process that autonomously derives diagnostic criteria: diversification expands pathology-style explanations, while optimization refines them for accuracy. This self-learning approach requires only small labeled sets and no white-box access or weight updates to generate cancer diagnoses. Evaluated on breast and prostate datasets, RECAP-PATH produced rationales aligned with expert assessment and delivered substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy over baselines.

Accepted at the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)", "summary": "Despite the explosive growth of AI and the technologies built upon it, predicting and inferring the sub-optimal behavior of users or human collaborators remains a critical challenge. In many cases, such behaviors are not a result of irrationality, but rather a rational decision made given inherent cognitive bounds and biased beliefs about the world. In this paper, we formally introduce a class of computational-rational (CR) user models for cognitively-bounded agents acting optimally under biased beliefs. The key novelty lies in explicitly modeling how a bounded memory process leads to a dynamically inconsistent and biased belief state and, consequently, sub-optimal sequential decision-making. We address the challenge of identifying the latent user-specific bound and inferring biased belief states from passive observations on the fly. We argue that for our formalized CR model family with an explicit and parameterized cognitive process, this challenge is tractable. To support our claim, we propose an efficient online inference method based on nested particle filtering that simultaneously tracks the user's latent belief state and estimates the unknown cognitive bound from a stream of observed actions. We validate our approach in a representative navigation task using memory decay as an example of a cognitive bound. With simulations, we show that (1) our CR model generates intuitively plausible behaviors corresponding to different levels of memory capacity, and (2) our inference method accurately and efficiently recovers the ground-truth cognitive bounds from limited observations ($\\le 100$ steps). We further demonstrate how this approach provides a principled foundation for developing adaptive AI assistants, enabling adaptive assistance that accounts for the user's memory limitations."}

In this work, we utilize curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning to discover Bosonic codes under approximate AQEC framework to resist both single-photon and double-photon losses. We present an analytical solution of solving the master equation under approximation conditions, which can significantly accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning. The agent first identifies an encoded subspace surpassing the breakeven point through rapid exploration within a constrained evolutionary time-frame, then strategically fine-tunes its policy to sustain this performance advantage over extended temporal horizons. We find that the two-phase trained agent can discover the optimal set of codewords, i.e., the Fock states $\\ket{4}$ and $\\ket{7}$ considering the effect of both single-photon and double-photon loss. We identify that the discovered code surpasses the breakeven threshold over a longer evolution time and achieve the state-of-art performance.

In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces, where identifying partner behaviors and selecting suitable responses is difficult. In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space. Through these experiments and an online user study, we demonstrate that our proposed agent achieves state of the art performance compared to existing baselines when paired with novel human, and agent teammates."}

Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Event-CausNet achieves robust performance, reducing prediction error (MAE) by up to 35.87%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data."}

To address these issues, we propose STEP (Success-rate-aware Trajectory-Efficient Policy optimization), a framework that dynamically allocates sampling based on per-task success rates and performs step-level optimization. STEP maintains a smoothed success-rate record to guide adaptive trajectory resampling, allocating more effort to harder tasks. It then computes success-rate-weighted advantages and decomposes trajectories into step-level samples. Finally, it applies a step-level GRPO augmentation to refine updates for low-success tasks.

However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus\" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing."}
