### [1] [Faster algorithms for graph homomorphism via tractable constraint satisfaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23000)
*Clément Carbonnel*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: 提出了一种在特定图类H（排除拓扑子式）上判定图同态存在性的单指数时间算法，并改进了奇数圈情形的随机算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图同态判定是图论与计算复杂性中的基础问题，现有算法在一般图上效率不足。当目标图H属于排除特定拓扑子式的图族时，需设计更高效的判定算法，并支持代价最小化扩展。

Method: 将问题归约为单指数数量级的约束满足问题（CSP），利用可处理语言（tractable languages）的CSP求解技术；针对奇数圈目标图设计改进的随机算法。

Result: 1. 当H属于排除拓扑子式的图族时，算法时间复杂度为$2^{O(n)}h^{O(1)}$，空间复杂度为多项式级；2. 支持代价最小化扩展；3. 奇数圈情形获得改进的随机算法。

Conclusion: 该工作显著提升了稀疏目标图类上的图同态判定效率，通过CSP归约框架实现了时间与空间复杂度的双重优化，并为特殊图结构提供了针对性加速方案。

Abstract: We show that the existence of a homomorphism from an $n$-vertex graph $G$ to an $h$-vertex graph $H$ can be decided in time $2^{O(n)}h^{O(1)}$ and polynomial space if $H$ comes from a family of graphs that excludes a topological minor. The algorithm is based on a reduction to a single-exponential number of constraint satisfaction problems over tractable languages and can handle cost minimization. We also present an improved randomized algorithm for the special case where the graph $H$ is an odd cycle.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We numerically investigate quantum circuit elementary-gate level instantiations of the standard Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm for the task of computing the ground-state energy of a quantum magnet; the disordered fully-connected quantum Heisenberg spin glass model. We consider (classical simulations of) QPE circuit computations on relatively small quantum Hamiltonians ($3$ qubits) with up to $10$ phase bits of precision, using up to Trotter order $10$. We systematically study the inputs of QPE, specifically time evolution, Trotter order, Trotter steps, and initial state, and illustrate how these inputs practically determine how QPE operates. From this we outline a coherent set of quantum algorithm input and tuning guidelines. One of the notable properties we characterize is that QPE sampling of the optimal digitized phase converges to a fixed rate. This results in strong diminishing returns of optimal phase sampling rates which can occur when the Trotter error is surprisingly high.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文研究了费米量子场论在量子计算机上的模拟，重点分析了质量Thirring模型和Gross-Neveu模型，计算了门复杂度并制备了基态，为在量子计算机上实现粒子物理标准模型提供了重要步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在量子计算机上实现粒子物理标准模型，理解手征对称性破缺、维度转置和共形窗口等基本场论现象。

Method: 在哈密顿量表述下，将质量Thirring和Gross-Neveu模型离散化到一维空间格点上；使用高阶乘积公式和块编码/量子化及量子奇异值变换计算门复杂度；采用自适应变分量子虚时算法制备基态；并对这些相对论性费米模型的动力学李代数进行分类。

Conclusion: 该工作是向在近期和早期容错量子计算机上模拟大N_f费米量子场论实时动力学的重要一步，对研究手征对称性破缺、维度转置和共形窗口等场论问题具有重要意义。

Abstract: The study of fermionic quantum field theories is an important problem for realizing the standard model of particle physics on a quantum computer. As a step towards this goal, we consider the massive Thirring and Gross--Neveu models with arbitrary number of fermion flavors, $N_f$, discretized on a spatial one-dimensional lattice of size $L$ in the Hamiltonian formulation. We compute the gate complexity using the higher-order product formula and using block-encoding/qubitization and quantum singular value transformations in the limit of large $N_f$ and $L$. We also prepare the ground states of both models with excellent fidelity for system sizes up to 20 qubits with $N_f = 1,2,3,4$ using the adaptive-variational quantum imaginary time algorithm. In addition, we also classify the dynamical Lie algebras of these relativistic fermionic models and show that they belong to the same isomorphism class. Our work is a concrete step towards the quantum simulation of real-time dynamics of large $N_f$ fermionic quantum field theories models relevant for chiral symmetry breaking, understanding dimensional transmutation, and exploring the conformal window of field theories on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computers.

### [4] [Dequantization Barriers for Guided Stoquastic Hamiltonians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23183)
*Yassine Hamoudi,Yvan Le Borgne,Shrinidhi Teganahally Sridhara*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 构造了一个基于指数级大图的Perron-Frobenius特征向量的概率分布，该分布无法被任何经典算法高效采样（即使提供最优初始分布）；而量子计算机可高效求解对应的stoquastic哈密顿量基态制备问题，证明经典算法无法高效解决此类广泛问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索经典与量子计算在特定概率分布采样和基态制备问题上的根本能力边界，特别是针对stoquastic哈密顿量系统是否存在经典"去量子化"可能。

Method: 通过构建高degree、高girth的谱扩展器并附加自相似树结构，构造指数级大图的Perron-Frobenius特征向量分布；扩展Gilyén等[Quantum 2021]的方法，将特定绝热路径算法的不可行性强推广至所有经典算法。

Result: 证明该分布无法被任何经典算法高效采样（即使提供最优warm-start）；在量子设定下，该问题等价于给定引导态输入时制备stoquastic哈密顿量基态，可被量子计算机高效求解；首次排除所有经典算法高效解决此类引导基态制备问题的可能性。

Conclusion: 建立了经典计算在广泛stoquastic基态问题上的根本性局限，为量子优势提供了新证据；显著强化了先前仅针对特定绝热路径算法的结论，将"去量子化"排除范围从单一算法扩展至所有经典算法。

Abstract: We construct a probability distribution, induced by the Perron--Frobenius eigenvector of an exponentially large graph, which cannot be efficiently sampled by any classical algorithm, even when provided with the best-possible warm-start distribution. In the quantum setting, this problem can be viewed as preparing the ground state of a stoquastic Hamiltonian given a guiding state as input, and is known to be efficiently solvable on a quantum computer. Our result suggests that no efficient classical algorithm can solve a broad class of stoquastic ground-state problems.
  Our graph is constructed from a class of high-degree, high-girth spectral expanders to which self-similar trees are attached. This builds on and extends prior work of Gilyén, Hastings, and Vazirani [Quantum 2021, STOC 2021], which ruled out dequantization for a specific stoquastic adiabatic path algorithm. We strengthen their result by ruling out any classical algorithm for guided ground-state preparation.

### [5] [Taxonomy of Integrable and Ground-State Solvable Models: Jastrow Wavefunctions on Graphs and Parent Hamiltonians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22315)
*Nilanjan Sasmal,Adolfo del Campo*

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立图论与多体量子系统的联系，为设计具有特定基态的相互作用系统提供统一框架，推广自旋系统到连续变量体系

Method: 利用图的邻接矩阵定义两体相互作用，引入2-路径上的三体相互作用，采用Jastrow形式的基态波函数结构，结合图论方法分类模型

Result: 获得包含图邻接矩阵两体作用和2-路径三体作用的父哈密顿量，系统性地生成大量可精确求解的新模型，并重现文献中的已知实例

Conclusion: 构建了图论驱动的量子多体系统构造方法，为设计新型可解量子流体模型提供了普适性框架，扩展了连续变量系统的研究范式

Abstract: We introduce a family of many-body systems of distinguishable continuous-variable particles in which interparticle interactions are set by the adjacency matrix of a graph. The ground-state wavefunction of such systems is of a generalized Jastrow form involving the product of pair-correlation functions over the edge set of the graph. These systems describe quantum fluids when the graph is complete, and the pair function has a well-defined permutation symmetry. In general, they provide the continuous-variable generalization of spin systems on graphs, with broken permutation symmetry. The corresponding parent Hamiltonian is shown to include (a) two-body interactions determined by the graph adjacency matrix and (b) three-body interactions over all possible 2-paths on the graph. Employing elements of graph theory, we chart the landscape of models, recovering known instances in the literature and providing numerous new examples of ground-state solvable models for which the system Hamiltonian, ground-state wavefunction, and corresponding energy eigenvalue are specified.

### [6] [Optimization-based Unfolding in High-Energy Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22776)
*Simone Gasperini,Gianluca Bianco,Marco Lorusso,Carla Rieger,Michele Grossi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 将高能物理unfolding问题重构为正则化二次优化，开发经典-量子兼容框架QUnfold，在合成数据上验证精度媲美传统方法，为量子增强数据分析提供新路径。

Result: 优化方法在多分布上达到竞争精度，目标函数自然包含正则化项。

Conclusion: 建立unfolding统一优化视角，为量子增强方法在实验高能物理分析提供实用探索路径。

Abstract: In High-Energy Physics, unfolding is the process of reconstructing true distributions of physical observables from detector-distorted measurements. Starting from its reformulation as a regularized quadratic optimization, we develop a framework to tackle this problem using both classical and quantum-compatible methods. In particular, we derive a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) representation of the unfolding objective, allowing direct implementation on quantum annealing and hybrid quantum-classical solvers. The proposed approach is implemented in QUnfold, an open-source Python package integrating classical mixed-integer solvers and D-Wave's hybrid quantum solver. We benchmark the method against widely used unfolding techniques in RooUnfold, including response Matrix Inversion, Iterative Bayesian Unfolding, and Singular Value Decomposition unfolding, using synthetic dataset with controlled distortion effects. Our results demonstrate that the optimization-based approach achieves competitive reconstruction accuracy across multiple distributions while naturally accommodating regularization within the objective function. This work establishes a unified optimization perspective on unfolding and provides a practical pathway for exploring quantum-enhanced methods in experimental HEP data analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum key distribution's noise tolerance and transmission distance are fundamentally constrained, limiting practical implementation; understanding these ultimate limits is crucial for real-world deployment.

Method: Established maximum quantum bit error rate (QBER) thresholds and derived upper bounds on communication distance using a fundamental capacity threshold for qubit Pauli channels, connecting information-theoretic limits to realistic physical noise models.

Result: Obtained universal bounds on achievable distances for fiber and free-space quantum links, including diffraction-limited constraints relevant to deep-space communications, applicable to protocols using two or more mutually unbiased bases with single-photon or weak coherent sources.

Conclusion: These findings clarify the ultimate noise robustness of QKD and delineate the fundamental boundaries of secure quantum communication, providing critical design guidelines for future quantum networks.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables information-theoretic secure communication, yet its ultimate tolerance to noise and achievable transmission distance remain fundamentally constrained. We establish the maximum quantum bit error rate (QBER) compatible with secure QKD and derive corresponding upper bounds on communication distance. Our results follow from a fundamental capacity threshold for qubit Pauli channels and apply to protocols based on two or more mutually unbiased bases, using either single-photon or weak coherent sources. By connecting information-theoretic limits to realistic physical noise models, we obtain universal bounds on achievable distances in fiber and free-space links, including diffraction-limited constraints relevant to deep-space quantum communications. These findings clarify the ultimate noise robustness of QKD and delineate the fundamental boundaries of secure quantum communication.

Conclusion: 揭示对称性强制下的拓扑控制机制，为开放量子系统提供统一的拓扑动力学视角，实现从能带拓扑到非平衡谱拓扑的主动调控

Abstract: We establish a symmetry-protected correspondence between band topology of coherent Hamiltonians and Liouvillian spectral winding in Lindblad descriptions of open quantum systems. This allows the Hamiltonian topology to act as a knob for controlling Liouvillian topology and corresponding non-equilibrium dynamics, rather than being passively manipulated by system-environment exchanges. In particular, by exactly solving the Liouvillian spectrum in a class of one-dimensional dissipative lattices, we find that the Hamiltonian band topology constrains the Liouvillian spectral winding and determines the Liouvillian skin effect, provided the Hamiltonian and quantum jump operators respect the same chiral symmetry. We further demonstrate that lattice parity controls the associated bulk-boundary correspondence and the coherence properties of the steady state. Our results unveil a symmetry-enforced topological control of spectral and spatial organization in open quantum systems, providing a unified perspective on topology in Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics.

### [9] [Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation with Quantum Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22651)
*Ryotaro Honma,Tan Van Vu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper develops a finite-time thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) for open quantum systems that incorporates information-driven feedback control. By quantifying feedback's information contribution via quantum mutual information, it reveals how feedback suppresses fluctuations at a thermodynamic cost, establishing a fundamental precision bound for quantum control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluctuations in microscopic systems fundamentally limit nonequilibrium precision (per thermodynamic uncertainty relations/TURs), but the role of quantum feedback control—especially information-driven control via continuous monitoring—in modifying these limits remains unresolved.

Method: Analyzes open quantum systems weakly coupled to a thermal environment with continuously monitored quantum jumps and Markovian feedback. Uses quantum mutual information to quantify the information contribution from feedback control.

Result: Derives a generalized finite-time TUR linking current fluctuations to both entropy production and quantum mutual information (from feedback). Shows feedback suppresses fluctuations but incurs an information-thermodynamics trade-off.

Conclusion: Feedback control imposes a fundamental precision bound via information-thermodynamics interplay. Demonstrates practical application: feedback enhances quantum clock precision using only a single thermal reservoir, overcoming traditional limitations.

Abstract: Fluctuations are intrinsic to microscopic systems and impose fundamental limits on nonequilibrium precision, as captured by the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), which links current fluctuations to entropy production. While feedback control is expected to further suppress fluctuations, its role within the TUR framework has remained unclear, particularly in quantum systems where control is inherently information-driven. In this Letter, we consider open quantum systems weakly coupled to a thermal environment, in which quantum jumps are continuously monitored, and Markovian feedback is applied. Using quantum mutual information to quantify the information contribution induced by feedback, we derive a finite-time TUR for arbitrary time-integrated currents in terms of entropy production and mutual information. Our results uncover how feedback control suppresses fluctuations together with thermodynamic cost and establishes a fundamental precision bound imposed by information-based control. As an application, we analyze a quantum clock model and demonstrate that the clock precision can be enhanced by feedback control in the presence of a single thermal reservoir.

### [10] [The unbearable hardness of deciding about magic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22330)
*Lorenzo Leone,Jens Eisert,Salvatore F. E. Oliviero*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文证明刻画量子计算中的魔法需要超指数时间，揭示了量子资源评估的基本计算限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别经典与量子计算的分界是量子信息学的核心挑战。在多量子比特系统中，纠缠和魔法是实现真正量子行为的关键资源，但魔法作为通用量子计算的基础，其特性尚未被充分理解。

Method: 通过将问题归约为在n²个变量上求解3-SAT实例，并引用指数时间假设，证明了确定稳定子多面体成员资格即使在近似情况下也需要超指数时间exp(n²)。

Result: 主要结果是量化与认证魔法在根本上难以处理：任何魔法单调量都必须超指数级难计算，判断算子是否为有效魔法见证同样困难。此外，魔法的鲁棒性在单调量中计算最优，且这一困难延伸至经典可模拟情形，例如判断状态是否位于对数量非Clifford门生成状态的凸包内也超指数级困难。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了评估经典可模拟性、提取魔法状态以及利用魔法作为量子资源的内在计算限制。

Abstract: Identifying the boundary between classical and quantum computation is a central challenge in quantum information. In multi-qubit systems, entanglement and magic are the key resources underlying genuinely quantum behaviour. While entanglement is well understood, magic -- essential for universal quantum computation -- remains relatively poorly characterised. Here we show that determining membership in the stabilizer polytope, which defines the free states of magic-state resource theory, requires super-exponential time $\exp( n^2)$ in the number of qubits $n$, even approximately. We reduce the problem to solving a $3$-SAT instance on $n^2$ variables and, by invoking the exponential time hypothesis, the result follows. As a consequence, both quantifying and certifying magic are fundamentally intractable: any magic monotone for general states must be super-exponentially hard to compute, and deciding whether an operator is a valid magic witness is equally difficult. As a corollary, we establish the robustness of magic as computationally optimal among monotones. This barrier extends even to classically simulable regimes: deciding whether a state lies in the convex hull of states generated by a logarithmic number of non-Clifford gates is also super-exponentially hard. Together, these results reveal intrinsic computational limits on assessing classical simulability, distilling pathological magic states, and ultimately probing and exploiting magic as a quantum resource.

Method: 作者引入允许谱的多面体来表征素数维度多量子位的这些态，并通过例子（单量子位、双量子位、单三态量子位）说明。他们还研究内接和外接球的半径以推导纯度条件。

Result: 对于单量子位，绝对稳定子态形成内接于稳定子八面体的球体。高维下几何更复杂。存在非绝对稳定子的绝对维格纳正态，类似束缚魔法。半径给出了非稳定子和维格纳负态的最低纯度，以及绝对维格纳正态的必要条件。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了这些态的完整表征，突出了其几何性质和对量子信息的启示，如基于纯度的魔法和维格纳负性测试。

Abstract: Absolutely stabilizer states are those that remain convex mixtures of stabilizer states after conjugation by any unitary. Here we give a characterization of such states for multiple qudits of all prime dimensions by introducing a polytope of their allowed spectra. We illustrate this through the examples of one qubit, two qubits, and one qutrit. In particular, the set of absolutely stabilizer states for a single qubit is a ball inscribed in the stabilizer octahedron, but for higher dimensions the geometry is more complicated. For odd-prime-dimensional qudits, we also give a complete characterization of absolutely Wigner-positive states, i.e., states whose Wigner function remains nonnegative after conjugation by any unitary. In so doing, we show there are absolutely Wigner-positive states that are not absolutely stabilizer, which can be seen as a unitarily-invariant version of bound magic. We then study the radii of the largest balls contained in the sets of absolutely stabilizer states and absolutely Wigner-positive states. These radii respectively tell us the lowest possible purity of nonstabilizer and Wigner-negative states. Conversely, we also find the radius of the smallest ball containing the set of absolutely Wigner-positive states, giving a tight purity-based necessary condition thereof.

### [13] [A field-biased HPZ master equation and its Markovian limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22363)
*M. Gabriela Boada G.,Andrea Delgado,Jose Morales E*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Derives a quantum master equation for continuously driven open quantum systems without assuming equilibrium, showing how external fields create biased noise, non-Markovian memory effects, and modified dynamics relevant to quantum optics experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard quantum master equations assume equilibrium conditions via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, but modern cavity and circuit QED experiments operate far from equilibrium with continuous driving. A first-principles framework that doesn't rely on equilibrium assumptions is needed to understand field-biased fluctuation relations in these non-equilibrium systems.

Method: Starting from a driven Caldeira-Leggett model where an external classical field couples to both system and reservoir, the authors exactly eliminate the reservoir at the operator level. Exploiting the Gaussian nature of the driven bath, they derive a generalized Langevin equation with two-time kernels, which is then converted into a modified Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation.

Result: The bath statistics explicitly depend on the two-time autocorrelation function of the applied field, producing drive-biased noise correlations and intrinsically non-Markovian dynamics. The resulting master equation has diffusion coefficients and coherent forces that retain memory of the external field. The oscillation frequency is encoded in the homogeneous Green's function, while drive-induced corrections appear only in modified diffusion and drift terms.

Conclusion: This work provides a unified microscopic framework for understanding field-biased fluctuation relations in non-equilibrium quantum systems, with direct applicability to cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments operating far from equilibrium.

Abstract: We present a first-principles derivation of a non-equilibrium quantum master equation for a continuously driven open quantum system interacting with a structured electromagnetic environment. Starting from a driven Caldeira-Leggett model in which an external classical field couples simultaneously to the system and reservoir degrees of freedom, we proceed without assuming that the standard equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds. The bath statistics acquire explicit dependence on the two-time autocorrelation function of the applied field, leading to drive-biased noise correlations and intrinsically non-Markovian dynamics. By eliminating the reservoir exactly at the operator level, we obtain a driven quantum generalized Langevin equation whose noise and dissipation kernels depend on two independent times. Exploiting the Gaussian nature of the driven bath, we derive a modified Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation in which the diffusion coefficients and coherent forces inherit explicit memory of the external field. We demonstrate that the physically observable oscillation frequency remains encoded in the homogeneous Green's function of the Langevin equation, while the drive-induced corrections manifest exclusively through modified diffusion and drift terms. Our results provide a unified microscopic framework for understanding field-biased fluctuation relations with direct relevance to cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments operating far from equilibrium.

### [14] [Revisiting the Role of State Texture in Gate Identification and Fixed-Point Resource Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22496)
*Alexander C. B. Greenwood,Joseph M. Lukens,Li Qian,Brian T. Kirby*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper generalizes a quantum gate identification protocol using fidelity-based methods, explores new resource theories tied to reference states, and analyzes monotonicity properties in fixed-point resource theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the original gate identification protocol (based on randomized states and state texture) to a more universally applicable fidelity-based framework, and to establish broader resource-theoretic foundations without relying on computational shortcuts.

Method: Replacing randomized input states with fidelity-based measurements; defining resource theories per reference pure state; using convex-roof constructions to extend resourceless sets; introducing fixed-point resource theories (e.g., texture, coherence, purity).

Result: 1) Protocol succeeds for nearly all laboratory bases via fidelity formulation. 2) Recovers known measures (imaginarity, coherence) via convex-roof extension. 3) Fixed-point theories show weak monotonicity for fidelity-based bounds but strong monotonicity violations for convex-roof logarithmic measures.

Conclusion: The fidelity-based approach significantly broadens the protocol's practicality, while the generalized resource theory framework reveals nuanced monotonicity behaviors, advancing understanding of quantum resources beyond the original state texture formulation.

Abstract: A protocol for identifying controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates versus single-qubit-only gates in universal quantum circuits using randomized input states was recently shown to be intimately connected to the quantum resource of state texture. Here we revisit this gate identification protocol and demonstrate that a more general fidelity-based formulation succeeds for nearly all laboratory bases. We then examine a broader family of quantum resource theories, where a distinct resource theory can be defined for each choice of reference pure state, establishing core resource-theoretic requirements without the computational shortcut offered by the "grand sum" employed in the original formulation of state texture. By extending from single "resourceless" states to convex sets via a convex-roof construction, we recover single-qubit measures of known resource theories such as imaginarity and coherence. Finally, we introduce a family of "fixed-point resource theories" that includes fixed-point instances of the theories of state texture, genuine coherence, purity, and athermality. For these fixed-point resource theories we show that, under free operations, the fidelity-based lower bound is weakly monotonic, while specific violations of strong monotonicity are found for the convex-roof logarithmic measure.

### [15] [Quantified convergence of general homodyne measurements with applications to continuous variable quantum computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22511)
*Emanuel Knill,Ezad Shojaee,James R. van Meter,Akira Kyle,Scott Glancy*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces broadband pulsed (BBP) homodyne measurements as a generalization of standard pulsed homodyne that can utilize high-efficiency broadband detectors like calorimeters. It derives fidelity bounds quantifying how well both measurement types approximate target quadratures, and validates these bounds through applications in quantum state characterization, teleportation, and error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard pulsed homodyne measurements are constrained by detector limitations, while emerging broadband detectors (e.g., calorimeters) offer high efficiency over wide spectral ranges but aren't compatible with existing measurement frameworks. There's a need to generalize homodyne measurements to leverage these detectors while maintaining the ability to measure arbitrary quadratures for practical quantum information processing.

Method: The authors develop theoretical lower bounds on the fidelity of post-measurement states for both standard and BBP homodyne measurements. These bounds quantify convergence to ideal quadrature measurements and depend on local oscillator amplitude and number operator moments. The framework is applied to evaluate standard pulsed homodyne performance across specific quantum information tasks.

Result: Derivation of two fidelity lower bounds: (1) for the post-measurement classical-quantum state of outcomes and unmeasured modes, and (2) for states after conditional operations. Practical evaluation demonstrates these bounds for standard pulsed homodyne in estimating Wigner distribution characteristic functions, moment expectations, quantum teleportation fidelity, and continuous-variable error correction with GKP codes.

Conclusion: BBP homodyne successfully generalizes standard pulsed homodyne to accommodate broadband detectors while preserving key advantages. The derived fidelity bounds provide practical performance guarantees, showing BBP's potential for high-efficiency quantum measurements and validating its use in essential quantum information protocols.

Abstract: In arXiv:2503.00188 we introduced broadband pulsed (BBP) homodyne measurements as a generalization of standard pulsed homodyne quadrature measurements. BBP can take advantage of detectors such as calorimeters that have the potential for high efficiency over a broad spectral range. BBP homodyne retains the advantages of standard pulsed homodyne, enabling measurement of arbitrary quadratures in the limit of large amplitude local oscillators (LO). Here we quantify the convergence of standard and BBP homodyne quadrature measurements to those of the quadrature of interest. We obtain lower bounds on the fidelity of the post-measurement classical-quantum state of outcomes and unmeasured modes, and the fidelity of the states obtained after applying operations conditional on measurement outcomes. The bounds depend on the LO amplitude and the moments of number operators. We demonstrate the practical relevance of these bounds by evaluating them for standard pulsed homodyne used for estimating values of the characteristic function of the Wigner distribution, expectations of moments, for quantum teleportation and for continuous variable error correction with GKP codes.

### [16] [Gravitational decoherence and recoherence of a composite particle: the interplay between gravitons and a classical Newtonian potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22517)
*Thiago H. Moreira,Lucas Chibebe Céleri*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper extends graviton-induced decoherence analysis by including classical Newtonian potential, showing that internal system dynamics ensure long-term decoherence even for microscopic masses, while classical gravity can slightly slow the process or cause recoherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational environments cannot be shielded (gravity is universal), making them theoretically important for decoherence and quantum-to-classical transition. Previous work suggested graviton-induced decoherence only affected macroscopic systems, but recent findings showed enhancement through internal structure, which this paper builds upon.

Method: Extended existing graviton-induced decoherence models by incorporating interactions with a classical Newtonian potential, analyzing the interplay between graviton bath, internal degrees of freedom, and classical gravity.

Result: 1) Graviton bath dominates short-term decoherence (relative to superposition size timescale); 2) Interplay with internal degrees of freedom makes long-term decoherence inevitable even for microscopic masses; 3) Classical Newtonian potential slightly slows decoherence; 4) For systems without internal dynamics, classical potential can theoretically cause recoherence.

Conclusion: Graviton-induced decoherence is more universal than previously thought, affecting even microscopic masses over time due to internal structure. Classical gravity modifies but doesn't prevent this process, and can reverse it (recoherence) in special cases lacking internal dynamics.

Abstract: The fact that gravitational environments cannot be shielded (since gravity is universal) makes them of great theoretical interest to decoherence mechanisms and to the quantum-to-classical transition. While past results seemed to indicate that graviton-induced decoherence of spatial superpositions happens only for macroscopic systems, recently it was shown that this mechanism can be enhanced through the system's own dynamical internal structure. In this work, we extend this analysis by including the interaction with a classical Newtonian potential. We show that, although the graviton bath alone dominates the mechanism for short times compared to a timescale established by the size of the quantum spatial superposition, the interplay between the gravitons and the internal degrees of freedom of the system renders decoherence inevitable in the long-time limit, even for microscopic masses. We also show that this mechanism is slightly slowed down by the interplay with the classical Newtonian potential, which, for systems without dynamical internal degrees of freedom, can even lead to recoherence, at least in principle.

Abstract: Large, 3D trapped ion crystals offer improved sensitivity in quantum sensing protocols, and are expected to be implemented as platforms in near-future experiments. However, numerical techniques used to study the laser cooling of such crystals are inefficient as the number of ions, $N$, in the crystal increases. Here we develop a powerful numerical framework to simulate laser cooling of up to $10^5$ ions stored in a Penning trap. We apply this framework to characterize and optimize the cooling of ellipsoidal 3D crystals. We document new pathways to enhanced cooling based on the addition of an axial component to the potential energy-dominated $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ modes. Furthermore, we observe greatly enhanced cooling of the perpendicular kinetic energy to below 1 mK in prolate ion crystals, enabling a simplified cooling beam setup for such crystals. We propose specific values of trap and laser beam parameters which lead to optimal cooling in a variety of examples. This work illustrates the feasibility of preparing large 3D crystals for high-sensitivity quantum science protocols, motivating their use in future experiments.

Method: 在拉曼放大过程中，利用斯托克斯场与原子自旋波之间已建立的量子关联，将部分斯托克斯场反馈回放大器，形成反馈环路以抑制量子噪声。

Result: 在高增益条件下实现了最大6 dB的量子噪声降低，且该抑制效果与反馈损耗无关。单路径反馈放大器表现出对反馈相位的敏感性。

Conclusion: 该相位敏感的反馈方案可扩展应用于集成光学和光纤系统，为量子精密测量提供了新思路。

Abstract: A quantum amplifier usually adds extra noise inevitably through coupling to internal degrees of freedom while amplifying the signal. The introduction of quantum correlations can effectively suppress this extra noise. In this work, we utilize the established quantum correlation between the Stokes field and atomic spin waves in the Raman amplification process to feedback a portion of the Stokes field into the amplifier. This leads to a reduction in quantum noise that is independent of the feedback loss at high gain. A maximum of 6 dB noise reduction is observed. The single-path feedback amplifier is found to be sensitive to the feedback phase, a property that expands its potential for applications in quantum precision measurement, and the general concept can be extended to integrated optics and fiber optic systems.

Conclusion: 该结果表明许多被认为需要量子优势的问题实际可用经典算法以拟多项式资源解决，挑战了量子多体物理中的现有认知。

Abstract: Estimating thermal expectations of local observables is a natural target for quantum advantage. We give a simple classical algorithm that approximates thermal expectations, and we show it has quasi-polynomial cost $n^{O(\log n/ε)}$ for all temperatures above a phase transition in the free energy. For many natural models, this coincides with the entire fast-mixing, quantumly easy phase. Our results apply to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model at any constant temperature -- including when the thermal state is highly entangled and satisfies polynomial quantum circuit lower bounds, a sign problem, and nontrivial instance-to-instance fluctuations. Our analysis of the SYK model relies on the replica trick to control the complex zeros of the partition function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between theoretical security proofs and practical deployment of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) by providing experimental validation and a usable finite key analysis framework for the COW-QKD protocol under realistic operational conditions.

Method: 1) Experimental implementation of COW-QKD with continuous operation under varying parameters; 2) Extension of existing finite key analysis methods to create a practical framework for COW-QKD; 3) Application of this framework to analyze secure key rates using experimental data.

Result: 1) Achieved stable secure key rates between 1.2-1.6 kbps over several hours of operation; 2) Verified security for medium-range transmissions up to ~156 km (with 0.1 detector efficiency) or 171 km (with 0.2 efficiency) over 0.2 dB/km loss fiber; 3) Quantified QBER and phase error rates under finite key analysis.

Conclusion: COW-QKD is experimentally viable for real-world medium-distance quantum communication, with the provided framework enabling practical security assessment. The protocol maintains stable performance and proven security under extended operation with realistic hardware limitations.

Abstract: An experimental implementation of the Coherent One-Way Quantum Key Distribution (COW-QKD) protocol is reported under realistic conditions, and a clean and easy-to-use framework for performing finite key analysis of the COW-QKD protocol is provided by extending a set of existing results. The framework provided here is used to perform finite key rate analysis of the COW-QKD protocol with respect to the actual parameters used in the experimental realization reported here. The system is kept running for several hours with different experimental parameters and stable secure key rates between 1.2 to 1.6 kbps are observed. In addition, QBER, phase error rate and secure key rate are obtained under finite key analysis, and it is shown that COW-QKD is secure for medium-range transmissions (up-to ~ 156 (171) km of optical fiber with 0.2 dB loss per km if detector efficiency is 0.1 (0.2) and other parameters are same as those used in this experiment).

Abstract: The number resolution of solid-state artificial atoms is of fundamental interest for the study of quantum few-body systems, yet remains experimentally challenging. Quantum optical experiments offer a non-invasive approach which links up macroscopic measurements with the quantity of quantum emitters. In this work, we propose a time-domain quantum optical methodology for the strict numbering of colloidal CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) confined in subwavelength-size polystyrene capsules. The non-polarized, homogeneously broadened emission of colloidal QDs in the subwavelength volume satisfies the description of Dicke's superradiance of identical quantum emitters. An analytic relation describes the numerical dependence of the second-order photon correlation on the number and the collective lifetime of emitters, yielding an experimental counting range of colloidal QDs from one to ten. This work provides a robust pathway for the non-invasive numbering of artificial atoms and the investigation of collective light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.

Abstract: A classic feature of gravity is that it is an attractive force. If a source mass is prepared in a localized (classical- like) state, it will cause another probe mass to move towards it. Here we consider the situation in which a source mass is prepared in a quantum superposition of distinct spatial states while a probe mass interacts with it. Conditional on the detection of the source mass in a specific state, the probe mass will be found to move away from the source mass (repulsion). This signifies the quantum superposition of gravitational forces acting on the probe mass and thereby the fact that spacetime can exist in quantum superpositions. The technique used is the repulsive effect arising from an anomalous negative weak value. A potential experimental implementation with spin bearing nanocrystals is outlined.

Abstract: The discovery of new quantum error-correcting codes that encode several logical qubits into relatively few physical qubits motivates the development of efficient and accurate methods of decoding these systems. Here, we adopt the minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm, a subroutine invaluable to decoding topological codes, to decode bivariate bicycle codes. Using the equivalence of bivariate bicycle codes to copies of the toric code, we propose a method we call the 'cylinder trick' to rapidly find a correction using matching on code symmetries. We benchmark our decoder on the gross code family, cyclic hypergraph-product codes, generalized toric codes, and recently proposed directional codes, demonstrating the general applicability of our protocol. For a subset of these codes, we find that our decoder can be significantly improved by augmenting matching with strategies including belief propagation and 'over-matching', thus achieving performance competitive with state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: We investigate the steady state of two single-mode uniform spatially separated polaritonic conden- sates exposed to resonant pumping with entangled pairs of photons. We demonstrate the principal possibility of driving the system to an entangled state despite its exposure to noises arising from the excitonic reservoir and photon leakage through the microcavity mirrors. Estimates are provided for the flux of entangled particles required to drive the system into a steady state that violates the partial-transpose criterion for entanglement. Furthermore, we trace the evolution of the system after a sudden disappearance of the entangled pumping. Our analysis provides estimates for the entanglement lifetime in a system of two exciton-polariton condensates

Conclusion: 量子不相容性并非观测量的内禀属性，而是由量子探针的全局配置决定；揭示了互补性的构型依赖结构， entanglement 在测量限制中的微妙作用，并呼吁在有限资源条件下重新评估量子信息协议。

Abstract: Bohr's principle of complementarity, prohibiting simultaneous access to certain physical properties within a single experimental arrangement, is considered to be a defining feature of quantum mechanics. It is commonly viewed as inducing an intrinsic hierarchy among incompatible observables: some sets of quantum properties are fundamentally more incompatible than others, as quantified by the maximal sharpness permitting their joint measurement. We show that this hierarchy ceases to be absolute in the multi-copy regime. Analyzing qubit spin observables, we prove a No-Comparison Theorem establishing that no global ordering of incompatible observable sets is preserved across all finite-copy configurations. In particular, two sets of observables can exhibit reversed complementarity ordering depending solely on whether the available resources are arranged as identical copies or as parallel-antiparallel pairs. Thus, the degree of quantum incompatibility is not an intrinsic property of observables alone but depends on the global configuration of the prepared quantum probes. Our results uncover a configuration-dependent structure of complementarity, reveal a subtle role of entanglement in shaping the structure of measurement limitations, and call for a reassessment of quantum information protocols under finite resources.

Abstract: Preserving multipartite entanglement in open many-body quantum systems is fundamentally limited by unavoidable environmental noise. We study the open-system dynamics of multipartite entanglement in an anisotropic XXZ spin chain interacting with a thermal spin bath, focusing on two states with distinct types of multipartite entanglement: the generalized GHZ and the generalized W state. Using a master-equation approach combined with the Bethe ansatz technique, we show analytically that robustness of multipartite entanglement at low temperatures can be enhanced by suitably tuning the anisotropy of the system. Our results highlight interaction-induced spectral control as a mechanism for stabilizing multipartite entanglement in quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: Sympathetic laser cooling is a key concept in precision spectroscopy and quantum state control of charged particles. Significant challenges arise in the metrologically relevant case where the effective interaction between the particles is weak and the particle to be cooled exhibits significant initial motional energy. Here we specifically address the most generally applicable case where the laser-cooled ion and the particle of interest are confined to two spatially separate potential wells with equal motional frequency for resonant enhancement of the cooling dynamics. We analyze the latter through numerical simulations and find that anharmonicities of the potential wells can prevent maintaining the resonance condition throughout the cooling process and thus inhibit a significant reduction in motional energy. We propose a cooling scheme that sweeps the trapping frequency of the potential wells. We show that this scheme enables efficient cooling from cryogenic temperatures all the way to the quantum regime of motion. As a specific application scenario, we analyze the sympathetic cooling of (anti-)protons into the quantum regime of motion for quantum-logic-spectroscopy-based tests of CPT invariance at the quantum limit in Penning traps. Nevertheless, our results and cooling strategies are generally applicable to other laser-inaccessible ion species.

TL;DR: 本文在IBM量子硬件上实验证明，在T1主导的噪声下，变分量子算法中的噪声诱导贫瘠高原（NIBP）实际上并不会出现，梯度会饱和而非指数衰减，且有效相干时间比标准校准数据所显示的更短。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分量子算法是近期量子计算非常有前景的工具，但其性能受到梯度消失导致的贫瘠高原的根本限制。噪声诱导贫瘠高原（NIBP）特别值得关注，因为它被预测会因噪声累积而产生，且与电路结构无关，这对近-term量子计算的实用性构成严重威胁。

Method: 使用信息含量景观分析（ICLA）高效估计8-102量子比特电路的梯度范数。在IBM量子硬件上进行实验，并对8量子比特情况在各类噪声模型（无噪声、退极化、振幅阻尼、相位阻尼）下进行经典模拟作为基准比较，同时考虑校准数据、采样噪声和电路结构的影响。

Result: 稳健观察到梯度幅度在特征电路运行时间后饱和，与NIBP预期的指数衰减形成对比。在T1主导的噪声下，NIBP不会发生。提取的有效T1^eff显著短于标准校准数据所建议的值。

Conclusion: 实验结果证实了在非幺正噪声下NIBP不出现的近期理论预测。这些发现表明，基于设备特性平均值的传统基准指标可能不足以预测变分算法性能，需要考虑完整的分布信息来准确评估量子硬件性能。

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are a very promising tool for near-term quantum computing. However, despite their flexibility and wide applicability, their performance is fundamentally limited by Barren Plateaus (BP), where gradients vanish and optimization becomes intractable. Noise-Induced Barren Plateaus (NIBP) are particularly interesting, as they are predicted to arise due to noise accumulation independent of circuit structure. We experimentally study NIBP on IBM quantum hardware and demonstrate their absence under non-unital amplitude damping characterized by the qubit's $T_1$ coherence times. We use Information Content Landscape Analysis (ICLA) to efficiently estimate gradient norms for circuits ranging from 8 to 102 qubits, with hundreds of parameters and circuit runtimes of hundreds of microseconds. Classical simulations of the 8-qubit case under noiseless, depolarizing, amplitude damping, and dephasing noise models serve as a baseline comparison. We thoroughly analyze the experimental results considering calibration data, shot-noise, and circuit structure. We robustly observe that the gradient magnitude saturates beyond a characteristic circuit runtime, in contrast with the exponential decay expected from NIBP. Using recent theoretical results, we corroborate that under $T_1$-dominated noise NIBP do not occur and extract an effective $T_1^\text{eff}$ that is significantly shorter than suggested by standard calibration data. Our results experimentally confirm recent predictions on the absence of NIBP under non-unital noise. These findings also indicate that conventional benchmarking metrics based on average values for device characteristics may be insufficient to predict variational algorithm performance, but full distributions need to be considered.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of spin-cat qubits for bias-tailored quantum error correction by achieving high-fidelity single-qubit control of 173Yb nuclear spins in optical tweezers and characterizing the noise bias essential for this approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias-tailored quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) promise higher error thresholds and hardware efficiency compared to standard QECCs. Spin-cat qubits encoded in large nuclear spin systems are promising candidates, but their implementation faces challenges: difficulty performing fast arbitrary-angle SU(2) rotations and lack of noise characterization in neutral atom platforms.

Method: The authors implemented single-qubit controls of 173Yb spin-cat qubits (nuclear spin I=5/2) in an optical tweezer array. They performed covariant SU(2) rotations and non-linear rotations using optical beams, measured coherence and relaxation times, and benchmarked noise bias of rank-preserving gates.

Result: Achieved averaged single-Clifford gate fidelity of 0.961. Discovered that idling errors become increasingly biased toward dephasing as encoded sublevel magnitude increases. Demonstrated a finite noise bias of 18 for spin-cat qubits, contrasting with unbiased two-level systems in 171Yb.

Conclusion: This work successfully demonstrates the experimental feasibility of spin-cat qubits for realizing bias-tailored QECCs, overcoming key technical barriers and paving the way toward hardware-efficient quantum error correction.

Abstract: Bias-tailored quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) offer a higher error threshold than standard QECCs and have the potential to achieve lower logical errors with less space overhead. The spin-cat qubit, encoded in a large nuclear spin-$F$ system, is a promising candidate for bias-tailored QECCs. Yet its feasibility is hindered by the difficulty of performing fast covariant SU(2) rotation with arbitrary rotation angles for nuclear spins and by a lack of noise characterization for gate operations in neutral atom platforms. Here we demonstrate single-qubit controls of ${}^{173}\mathrm{Yb}$ spin-cat qubits with nuclear spin $I=5/2$ in an optical tweezer array. We implement a covariant SU(2) rotation and non-linear rotations by optical beams and achieve an averaged single-Clifford gate fidelity of $0.961_{-5}^{+5}$. The measurement of the coherence time and spin relaxation time shows that the idling error becomes increasingly biased toward dephasing errors as the magnitude of the encoded sublevel $|m_F|$ increases. Furthermore, we benchmark the noise bias of rank-preserving gates on spin-cat qubits, demonstrating a finite bias of $18_{-11}^{+132}$, in contrast to the case of the two-level system in ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$, which shows no bias within the experimental uncertainty. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of spin-cat qubits for realizing bias-tailored QECCs, paving the way for achieving hardware-efficient quantum error correction.

Result: 1) 观测性旋转能随经典后处理而递减，表明细粒度测量提取功能力更强；2) 对所有测量取最大值可恢复标准旋转能；3) 旋转能可分解为经典非相干项和量子相干项；4) 测量投影算符的相干性是突破非相干极限的关键。

Conclusion: 测量过程中的量子相干性是实现超越经典极限的量子优势的根本来源，建立了相干性与量子热力学功提取之间的直接联系。

Abstract: The amount of extractable work from a physical system is fundamentally connected to the information available about its state, as illustrated by Maxwell's demon and the Gibbs paradox. In standard thermodynamic protocols involving system--bath interactions, the maximum work is given by the free-energy difference between the initial state and the corresponding Gibbs state at the bath temperature. This motivates a natural question: does information also limit work extraction in closed quantum systems that do not involve a heat bath and where work is obtained through unitary operations generated by a time-dependent Hamiltonian? While ergotropy quantifies the maximum work extractable via unitary operations, it assumes complete knowledge of the quantum state, typically requiring full state tomography. In realistic scenarios, however, only partial information is accessible. In this case, the relevant figure of merit is observational ergotropy, which depends explicitly on the measurement used to probe the system. We show that observational ergotropy decreases under classical post-processing of measurement outcomes, implying that fine-grained measurements allow greater work extraction than coarse-grained ones. Moreover, maximizing observational ergotropy over all possible measurements recovers standard ergotropy, which decomposes into incoherent (classical) and coherent (quantum) contributions. Our results demonstrate that coherence in the measurement projectors constitutes the key resource, enabling work extraction beyond the incoherent limit and establishing coherence as the origin of quantum advantage in observational ergotropy extraction.

### [31] [Hyperbolic and Semi-Hyperbolic Floquet Codes for Photonic Quantum Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22906)
*Aygul Azatovna Galimova*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper constructs new hyperbolic Floquet codes from {8,3}, {10,3}, and {12,3} tessellations using Wythoff construction and LINS algorithm, evaluating them under four noise models to show promising error thresholds and 2.2× area advantage over surface codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tailoring error correcting codes to physical noise structure can reduce fault-tolerant quantum computation overhead. Hyperbolic Floquet codes are attractive because they use only weight-2 measurements compatible with hardware-native pair measurements.

Method: Construct hyperbolic and semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes from {8,3}, {10,3}, and {12,3} tessellations via Wythoff kaleidoscopic construction with Low-Index Normal Subgroups (LINS) algorithm. The {10,3} and {12,3} families are newly introduced to hyperbolic Floquet codes.

Result: Under phenomenological noise: thresholds ~0.3-0.5% for {8,3} (k=6-56) and ~0.15-0.2% for {10,3} (k=12-146). EM3 ancilla noise: ~1.5% threshold for all families. SDEM3 depolarizing noise: ~1.0-1.2% for all families. Erasure model: thresholds ~8.5-9% for {8,3}, ~7-8% for {10,3}, ~6.5-8% for {12,3}. Under SPOQC-2 noise: {8,3} codes achieve 2.2× fault-tolerant area of surface code for k=10 logical qubits.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic Floquet codes, particularly the new {10,3} and {12,3} families, demonstrate competitive error thresholds across multiple noise models and reduce hardware overhead compared to surface codes, making them promising for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: Tailoring error correcting codes to the structure of the physical noise can reduce the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Hyperbolic Floquet codes use only weight-2 measurements and can be implemented directly on hardware with native pair measurements. We construct hyperbolic and semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes from $\{8,3\}$, $\{10,3\}$, and $\{12,3\}$ tessellations via the Wythoff kaleidoscopic construction with the Low-Index Normal Subgroups (LINS) algorithm. The $\{10,3\}$ and $\{12,3\}$ families are new to hyperbolic Floquet codes. We evaluate these codes under four noise models: phenomenological, ancilla Entangling Measurement (EM3), Single-step Depolarizing EM3 (SDEM3), and erasure. Under phenomenological noise, specific-logical threshold crossings occur near $p_e \approx 0.3$--$0.5\%$ for $\{8,3\}$ ($k=6$--$56$) and $0.15$--$0.2\%$ for $\{10,3\}$ ($k=12$--$146$). EM3 ancilla noise yields a threshold of ${\sim}1.5\%$ for all three families. SDEM3 is a depolarizing noise model motivated by Majorana tetron architectures; fine-grained codes achieve thresholds of ${\sim}1.0$--$1.2\%$ for all three families. The erasure model captures detected photon loss on spin-optical links; fine-grained codes achieve erasure thresholds of ${\sim}8.5$--$9\%$ for $\{8,3\}$, ${\sim}7$--$8\%$ for $\{10,3\}$, and ${\sim}6.5$--$8\%$ for $\{12,3\}$. Photon loss is the dominant error source in photon-mediated quantum computing. Under the full three-parameter SPOQC-2 noise model, the $\{8,3\}$ codes achieve a 2D fault-tolerant area $2.2\times$ that of the surface code compiled to pair measurements while encoding $k = 10$ logical qubits. In a companion paper, we evaluate the same code families in a distributed setting.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of optical coherence squeezing in double-slit interference. We construct Hermitian operators that characterize the coherence at the slits, leading to coherence uncertainty relations and a corresponding squeezing condition. We also analyze states exhibiting such squeezing and show its manifestations in the uncertainty of the magnitudes and positions of the intensity fringes. Our work identifies coherence as a fundamental degree of freedom for squeezing, complementing phase, amplitude, and polarization, which could benefit quantum-enhanced interferometry.

Method: 理论分析两个相同巨型原子与一维波导的耦合系统，研究几何结构(原子内连接长度比和传播相位)对纠缠态的影响

Conclusion: 在巨型原子波导平台建立了对称性、几何结构、量子纠缠与连续谱束缚态之间的分析桥梁，为几何调控量子态提供新方案

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BiCs) convert dissipative open systems into effectively closed quantum subspaces through destructive interference. We show that two identical giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide support BICs that coincide with maximally entangled atomic states. Most importantly, entanglement is predominantly determined by the geometric design; the ratio of intra-atomic connection lengths fixes the concurrence, while the propagation phase between atoms selects a family of Bell-like states. We further analyze the dynamical stability of these maximally entangled BICs under exact time evolution, revealing a clear hierarchy of robustness against parameter perturbations. Our results establish an analytical bridge between symmetry, geometry, entanglement, and BICs in giant-atom waveguide platforms.

*Yang Yang,Yuzhu Long,Han Fang,Zhaoyun Chen,Zhonghui Li,Weiming Zhang,Guoping Guo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes the first watermarking framework for quantum circuit generative models (QCGMs) that embeds ownership signals directly into the generation process. Using symmetric sampling and latent drift correction, it protects quantum circuit IP while maintaining fidelity and robustness, enabling scalable copyright protection for AI-designed quantum circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum circuits are high-value intellectual property exposed to risks on cloud platforms. While digital watermarking exists, the shift from manual design to automated synthesis via quantum circuit generative models (QCGMs) makes existing post-hoc methods insufficient. They fail to ensure stealthiness, functional correctness, and robustness at scale, requiring a new natively integrated watermarking paradigm.

Method: A novel watermarking framework for QCGMs that embeds ownership signals during generation. It employs a symmetric sampling strategy aligned with the model's Gaussian prior, and a synchronization mechanism with latent drift correction to counteract adversarial attacks while preserving circuit fidelity.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates high-fidelity circuit generation and robust watermark detection across various perturbations, validating the framework's effectiveness in protecting QCGM-generated circuits.

Conclusion: The work establishes the foundation for scalable and secure copyright protection in AI-powered quantum circuit design, enabling IP protection in generative settings.

Abstract: Quantum cloud platforms have become the most widely adopted and mainstream approach for accessing quantum computing resources, due to the scarcity and operational complexity of quantum hardware. In this service-oriented paradigm, quantum circuits, which constitute high-value intellectual property, are exposed to risks of unauthorized access, reuse, and misuse. Digital watermarking has been explored as a promising mechanism for protecting quantum circuits by embedding ownership information for tracing and verification. However, driven by recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, the paradigm of quantum circuit design is shifting from individually and manually constructed circuits to automated synthesis based on quantum circuit generative models (QCGMs). In such generative settings, protecting only individual output circuits is insufficient, and existing post hoc, circuit-centric watermarking methods are not designed to integrate with the generative process, often failing to simultaneously ensure stealthiness, functional correctness, and robustness at scale. These limitations highlight the need for a new watermarking paradigm that is natively integrated with quantum circuit generative models. In this work, we present the first watermarking framework for QCGMs, which embeds ownership signals into the generation process while preserving circuit fidelity. We introduce a symmetric sampling strategy that aligns watermark encoding with the model's Gaussian prior, and a synchronization mechanism that counteracts adversarial watermark attack through latent drift correction. Empirical results confirm that our method achieves high-fidelity circuit generation and robust watermark detection across a range of perturbations, paving the way for scalable, secure copyright protection in AI-powered quantum design.

*Alberto Mayorgas,Pedro Pérez-Fernández,Álvaro Sáiz,José Miguel Arias*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) in a three-level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model with mixed chaotic dynamics, establishing a framework that combines chaos-sensitive measures (degree of chaos, Kullback-Leibler divergence) with standard ESQPT diagnostics to characterize complex spectral structures in enlarged Hilbert spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESQPTs have been extensively studied in two-level models, but characterization remains challenging in systems displaying mixed regular and chaotic dynamics. The three-level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model offers a richer structure with an enlarged Hilbert space and multiple separatrices strongly influenced by chaos.

Method: The authors calculate Poincaré sections and Peres lattices to investigate different dynamical regions in the three-level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, then combine chaos-sensitive measures with standard ESQPT diagnostics for static analysis.

Result: The degree of chaos and Kullback-Leibler divergence prove highly effective as complementary chaos-sensitive measures to traditional ESQPT diagnostics like mean field limit and participation ratio, revealing rich spectral structures in mixed dynamical regimes.

Conclusion: The study establishes a robust, standard framework for analyzing ESQPT signatures in chaotic three-level systems, enabling future dynamical behavior investigations and providing insights into the interplay between quantum phase transitions and chaos.

Abstract: Excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) have been extensively studied in two-level models, but their characterization remains challenging in systems displaying mixed regular and chaotic dynamics. In this work, we investigate ESQPTs within the three-level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, where an enlarged Hilbert space and multiple separatrices give rise to rich spectral structures strongly influenced by chaos. To investigate the different dynamical regions, we have calculated Poincaré sections and Peres lattices. In addition, by combining chaos-sensitive measures with standard ESQPT diagnostics, we provide a static analysis of ESQPT signatures in this model and establish a robust framework for future studies of its dynamical behavior. The degree of chaos and the Kullback-Leibler divergence are found to be very effective chaos-sensitive measures, which are complementary to ESQPT diagnostics such as the mean field limit and the participation ratio. Hence we provide a standard framework to work with ESQPTs in chaotic three-level systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contextuality and nonlocality, once considered mere foundational curiosities, are now recognized as crucial resources for quantum technologies, but were traditionally studied in isolation; this paper aims to reveal their deep connections and unify them.

Method: Employs theory-independent sheaf-theoretic and graph-theoretic frameworks to characterize statistical correlations in a unified way.

Result: The unified framework clarifies the structural relationship between contextuality and nonlocality, enables formulation of testable inequalities, and guides experimental implementations, particularly in photonic systems.

Conclusion: This review bridges abstract theory and concrete experiments, revealing the nonclassical foundations of quantum correlations and their emerging importance in quantum information processing.

Abstract: Quantum theory departs from classical physics in its treatment of correlations, most prominently through the phenomena of contextuality and nonlocality. Once regarded primarily as foundational curiosities, these effects are now understood as key operational resources for quantum computation, communication, and simulation. Although traditionally investigated in distinct settings, recent theoretical and experimental advances have revealed deep conceptual, mathematical, and operational connections between them. This review presents a unified perspective on these developments based on sheaf-theoretic and graph-theoretic frameworks, which provide theory-independent characterizations of statistical correlations. These approaches clarify the structural relationship between contextuality and nonlocality, facilitate the formulation of experimentally testable inequalities, and guide implementations in realistic physical platforms, with particular emphasis on photonic systems. By bridging abstract theoretical structures and concrete experimental realizations, this review sheds light on the nonclassical foundations of quantum correlations and their emerging role in quantum technologies.

Conclusion: 建立的频谱-空间模式分析框架可实现SPDC光源的多参数系统性优化，突破了传统定性设计方法的局限，为量子光学器件工程化提供了新范式

Abstract: Photon sources based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) are central to experimental quantum optics and quantum technologies. Their performance is commonly quantified by three metrics: pair-collection probability, heralding efficiency, and spectral purity. In bulk-crystal SPDC, these metrics are known to be mutually constrained, yet the physical origin of the resulting trade-offs is often obscured. We show that these trade-offs originate from the frequency-dependent population of discrete spatial modes in the SPDC emission. By performing a Laguerre-Gauss mode decomposition at each frequency component, we show how spectral-spatial non-separability impacts collection probability, heralding efficiency, and purity. We apply this framework to two widely used quasi-phase-matching configurations: collinear degenerate type-0 and type-II SPDC in periodically poled bulk crystals, and quantify how different phase-matching functions shape the spectral-spatial mode structure. In particular, for type-II SPDC we compare standard periodically poled and aperiodically poled Gaussian phase matching. We experimentally validate some of our theoretical results using spatial- and spectral-projection measurements. This spectral-spatial mode analysis provides a quantitative and predictive framework for understanding and engineering bulk-crystal photon sources, enabling systematic multi-parameter optimization beyond qualitative design guidelines.

Abstract: Quantum metrology promises measurement precision beyond classical limits by exploiting large-scale quantum states, yet realizing this advantage faces two fundamental challenges: the deterministic preparation of non-trivial quantum probes and the efficient extraction of metrological information in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Here, we introduce quantum confocal microscopy in Fock space that simultaneously resolves both challenges. Drawing a direct analogy between classical wave optics and quantum state evolution in a bosonic mode, we construct a confocal system with two Fock-space lenses. The first lens deterministically focuses a coherent state into a quantum probe with a tightly concentrated photon-number distribution, while the second lens maps the metrological information back to the vacuum state for efficient readout. Using a superconducting circuit QED platform, we prepare focused probe states with mean photon numbers up to ${N} = 500$, achieving a 21.5$\pm$1.1 dB compression of the photon-number uncertainty relative to a coherent state, with a scalable quantum circuit of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ operational depth. We demonstrate a displacement sensitivity scaling as $N^{-0.416}$, approaching the Heisenberg scaling ($N^{-0.5}$), and achieve a record metrological gain of 19.06$\pm$0.13 dB beyond the standard quantum limit. This work establishes quantum confocal microscopy as a scalable and practical framework for quantum-enhanced precision measurement, readily extendable to other bosonic platforms and high-dimensional quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Generalized master equations (GMEs) -- time-local but generally neither trace-preserving nor Hermiticity-preserving -- are convenient tools to compute properties of the environment of an open or continuously monitored quantum system. A two-sided master equation yields the fidelity and quantum Fisher information (QFI) of environment states, thereby setting fundamental limits for hypothesis testing and parameter estimation under continuous monitoring. For unmonitored noise or inefficient detection, the QFI of the detectable part of the environment may be obtained from a recently derived GME acting on multiple system replicas. Tilted master equations provide the full counting statistics of quantum jumps and diffusive measurements, enabling, e.g., studies of quantum thermodynamics beyond average values. Here we focus on bosonic linear systems, governed by a quadratic Hamiltonian and linear jump operators, whose dynamics preserves Gaussianity. For Gaussian initial states, we recast a generic GME as a compact set of ordinary differential equations for the covariance matrix (a Riccati-type equation), first moments, and normalization. These equations can be integrated efficiently without Hilbert-space truncation, and admit analytical results in simple settings. We also provide specialized forms for fidelity/QFI and full counting statistics. We illustrate the formalism with a continuously monitored optical parametric oscillator, using it to determine sensitivity limits for frequency estimation and to benchmark Hasegawa's thermodynamic uncertainty relations.

Abstract: We determine conditions on classical group algebra codes so that they have pre-orientation for cup products and copy-cup gates. This defines quantum codes that have constant-depth $\operatorname{CZ}$ and $\operatorname{CCZ}$ gates constructed via tensor products of classical group algebra codes, including hypergraph and balanced products. We show that determining the conditions relies on solving the perfect matching problem in graph theory. Conditions are fully determined for the 2- and 3-copy-cup gates, for group algebra codes up to weight 4, including for codes with odd check weight. These include the bivariate bicycle codes, which we show do not have the pre-orientation for either type of copy-cup gate. We show that abelian weight 4 group algebra codes satisfying the non-associative 3-copy-cup gate necessarily have a code distance of 2, whereas codes that satisfy conditions for the symmetric 3-copy-cup gate can have higher distances, and in fact also satisfy conditions for the 2-copy-cup gate. Finally we find examples of quantum codes from the product of abelian group algebra codes that have inter-code constant-depth $\operatorname{CZ}$ and $\operatorname{CCZ}$ gates.

Abstract: The extreme sensitivity of chaotic systems to external perturbations makes them natural candidates for sensing applications. We propose a single-shot echo-based protocol for estimating small rotations about an unknown axis that leverages random symmetric probe states prepared via chaotic dynamics. In contrast to previous protocols for this axis-agnostic rotation sensing problem that depend on difficult-to-prepare anticoherent states, the random probe states used in our protocol can be prepared via constant-depth chaotic circuits composed of random one-axis twisting pulses. We demonstrate analytically that our protocol achieves Heisenberg scaling relative to an arbitrary rotation axis that need not be a priori known. We also investigate the effects of collective and single-particle dephasing in our protocol using analytical and numerical tools. While the requirements on dephasing rates to maintain Heisenberg sensitivity are strict, they are achievable in near-term experiments, for instance, for magnetometric rotosensing with high-spin lanthanide atoms such as dysprosium-164.

Abstract: We derive a thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) under quantum continuous measurement and feedback control. By incorporating the quantum-classical-transfer entropy, which quantifies the information gained by continuous measurement, we show that the precision of currents is constrained by information-thermodynamic costs such as the entropy production and information gain. Our result shows that information gain has the potential to enhance the precision of currents beyond the bounds set by the conventional TUR. We illustrate the bound with a driven two-level system under continuous measurement and feedback, demonstrating that feedback achieves higher precision of currents while suppressing the entropy production.

Abstract: We pursue our study of integrable weak noise theories of directed polymer and interacting particle stochastic models in the 1D KPZ universality class. Here we focus on the $q$-TASEP in either continuous or discrete time. Each particle on $\mathbb{Z}$ jumps independently by $+1$ with a rate (or probability) depending on the gap to the next particle on its right. We consider initial conditions (either step or random) which are empty of particles on $\mathbb{Z}^+$, and focus on the dynamics of the $N$ rightmost particles. In the limit $q \to 1$ and at large time (and large gaps) we identify a new intermediate "mesoscopic" (i.e. finite $N$) regime which corresponds to weak noise. In that regime Poisson noise remains important. We obtain the large deviations of the position of a given particle by two methods. The first derives asymptotics of $q$-TASEP Fredholm determinant formula. The second maps the weak noise limit to a system of semi-discrete or fully discrete, non linear differential equations. These are obtained as saddle point classical equations of a dynamical field theory, and their solutions represent the optimal configurations in the large deviation regime. We show the classical integrability of these two systems, and exhibit their explicit Lax pair. In the case of the continuous time $q$-TASEP it provides the first instance of classical integrability arising in a stochastic system, with signatures of the Poisson noise persisting in the weak noise limit. For this model, we solve the scattering problem associated to its Lax pair and fully characterize the large deviations associated to the weak noise theory. Finally, we supplement this work with an Appendix on the first cumulant method to obtain the large deviations of several lattice polymer models (Strict Weak, Log Gamma, Beta).

Abstract: We analyse a continuous-time random walk model with stochastic reversals of direction. There is no external potential but the reorientation mechanism generates a non-zero current from asymmetry in the forward and backward waiting-time distributions (even when they have the same mean); the system can therefore can be considered as a type of active particle ratchet. We derive an explicit expression for the mean ratchet current with exponentially distributed reorientation times and also develop a general renewal-theory framework to obtain the full large deviations, using this to comment on the possibility of dynamical phase transitions.

TL;DR: 在β-UTe₃中发现重费米子态通过与电荷密度波(CDW)竞争并破坏费米面嵌套来抑制CDW有序，拓展了强关联电子相图的理解，为范德华异质结构中的邻近诱导相工程开辟了新途径。

Motivation: 电子相互作用可以驱动磁性、超导和拓扑性质，但在范德华材料中这些相的实现仍然有限。虽然传导电子与局域自旋之间的相互作用（Kondo杂化与RKKY交换）已被广泛研究，但这仅代表了强关联电子相图的一部分。本文旨在证明重费米子态也可以与电荷有序（如电荷密度波CDW）竞争。

Conclusion: 研究将Kondo相图扩展到超越自旋介导的竞争，为相关范德华异质结构中的邻近诱导相工程开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Electron interactions can drive magnetism, superconductivity, and topology. However, the realization of these phases remains limited in van der Waals materials, and the full landscape of strong correlations remains uncharted in any context. While interactions between conduction electrons and localized spins yield a well-known competition between heavy fermions (Kondo hybridization) and magnetic order (RKKY exchange), such spin-driven competition represents only part of the correlated electron phase diagram. Here we demonstrate that a heavy-fermion state can also compete with charge order, such as the charge density wave (CDW) state typical in the van der Waals $4f$ rare-earth tritellurides (RTe$_3$). We exploit the spatially-extended $5f$ orbitals of $β$-UTe$_3$ to enhance Kondo hybridization compared to its isostructural RTe$_3$ cousins. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy on $β$-UTe$_3$ shows Fano resonances characteristic of the heavy fermion state, while our quasiparticle interference imaging reveals the disappearance of Fermi-level nesting and the appearance of flat bands. We extend the tritelluride tight-binding model to include Kondo coupling and quantify the Fermi surface reconstruction. Consistent with the destruction of nesting, we observe no CDW in $β$-UTe$_3$. Our expansion of the Kondo phase diagram beyond spin-mediated competition opens new possibilities for proximity-induced phase engineering in correlated van der Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: Quantum geometry quantifies how the single-particle Bloch wavefunction changes in phase and amplitude across the Brillouin Zone. In multi-orbital systems where bands have strongly mixed orbital composition, quantum geometry plays a vital role in determining the ground state and low-energy properties of interacting electronic systems. In this work, we show that Mott metal-insulator transitions, as well as transitions between different magnetic orders within the Mott insulating phase, can be driven by the quantum geometry of the underlying Bloch band, thereby providing a mechanism complementary to conventional bandwidth-tuned Mott transitions. By studying the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that in in half-filled and topologically-trivial bands, quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states alone can act as a tuning knob for Mott metal-to-insulator and affect the competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. We show that both transitions may be heuristically understood via non-local Coulomb scattering in a basis of exponentially localized Wannier functions. These results highlight the role of quantum geometry beyond topological settings as a governing principle for conventional Mott and magnetic physics in multi-orbital and moiré materials.

Result: (1) 在反演对称的能隙区，电子密度在数值精度内与θ和U均无关；(2) KS参考体系坍缩为U无关的二次型代表；(3) 多体波函数展现非平凡几何响应，量子度量在中等U时依赖θ，强U时被强烈抑制；(4) KS与多体Berry相位在能隙区全程重合；(5) 这种重合源于对称性强制的Z₂扇区匹配。

Conclusion: KS与多体Berry相位的重合并非密度编码了多体Berry联络的证据，而是对称性强制的Z₂扇区匹配的结果。

Abstract: We study when a density-matching Kohn--Sham (KS) description can reproduce a many-body Berry phase in a correlated insulator, despite the fact that geometric phases are functionals of the wave function. Focusing on the one-dimensional SSH--Hubbard chain on a ring as a controlled interacting topological model, we introduce a $U(1)$ twist $θ$ (flux insertion). The many-body ground state along the full twist cycle is computed by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), while the onsite interaction $U$ is tuned from the noninteracting to the strong-coupling regime. At half filling in the inversion-symmetric gapped regime, our DMRG calculations show that the density remains constant within numerical accuracy over the entire $(θ,U)$ range studied. Thus, the density has no dependence on either the flux $θ$ or the interaction strength $U$. Accordingly, the symmetry-preserving density constraint collapses the KS reference to an SSH-type quadratic representative with $U$-independent geometric diagnostics. Nevertheless, the many-body wave function exhibits a nontrivial geometric response: the quantum metric associated with the $θ$-parametrized ground-state manifold depends on $θ$ at intermediate $U$ and is strongly suppressed at large $U$, consistent with the charge fluctuation freezing. Intriguingly, the KS and many-body Berry phases coincide throughout the gapped regime as $U$ is tuned from weak to strong coupling. We show that this agreement is best understood as symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector matching, rather than as evidence that the density encodes the many-body Berry connection.

Conclusion: 建立了动力学谱组织作为量子临界物质的基本原理，识别出记忆主导的临界性作为高温超导性的通用路径，为关联超导体的热力学和动力学现象提供了统一描述框架。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamical origin of high--temperature superconductivity remains a central challenge of strongly correlated quantum matter. Conventional approaches to quantum criticality assume overdamped Markovian dissipation governed by Ohmic Landau damping. Here we show that infrared collective dynamics is instead generically controlled by the time--scale density of states (TDOS) of relaxation modes. Within the Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--De Dominicis formalism, we derive an exact spectral representation of the collective susceptibility in terms of the TDOS. A finite infrared TDOS defines a new universality class of memory--dominated critical dynamics characterized by long--time kernels $K(t)\sim1/t$ and nonanalytic dynamical response. This spectral reorganization produces a strong infrared amplification of the particle--particle channel, converting the marginal instabilities of BCS and Eliashberg theories into algebraic superconducting transitions. As a result, the transition temperature scales linearly with the infrared spectral weight of slow collective modes, naturally yielding superconducting domes and Uemura scaling without invoking bosonic glue or fine tuning. The same slow--mode reservoir governs anomalous normal--state dynamics, including long--time correlations and strange--metal behavior, providing a unified description of thermodynamic and dynamical phenomena in correlated superconductors. Our results establish dynamical spectral organization as a fundamental principle of quantum critical matter and identify memory--dominated criticality as a generic route to high--temperature superconductivity.

Motivation: Understanding the fundamental evolution from Fermi liquid to Mott insulator in strongly correlated fermion systems, a hallmark phenomenon that remains incompletely characterized, especially at finite temperatures.

Method: Employed numerically unbiased auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method to study the half-filled square-lattice Hubbard model at finite temperatures, analyzing both thermodynamic and dynamical observables.

Result: 1) Established a refined T-U phase diagram showing an extended "Bad Metal" crossover regime separating Fermi liquid and Mott insulator; 2) Observed strong antiferromagnetic spin correlations and pronounced nodal-antinodal dichotomy in spectral functions during crossover; 3) Mapped thermal entropy across the diagram; 4) Identified parameter regions exhibiting Pomeranchuk cooling (adiabatic cooling with increasing U).

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive understanding of the metal-insulator crossover phenomenon, identifies the "Bad Metal" regime as a distinct phase, and offers crucial benchmarks for future optical lattice experiments simulating the square-lattice Hubbard model.

Abstract: The interaction-driven evolution from a Fermi liquid to a Mott insulator is a hallmark of strongly correlated fermion systems. In this work, we present a {\it numerically unbiased} study of such metal-to-insulator crossover in the half-filled square-lattice Hubbard model at finite temperatures, employing auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. By jointly analyzing thermodynamic and dynamical observables, we establish the crossover diagram of the model in the temperature-interaction ($T$-$U$) plane. With increasing $U$, our numerical results reveal an extended crossover regime, which we refer to as the {\it Bad Metal}, that separates the Fermi liquid and Mott insulator. During the crossover, we also examine the antiferromagnetic spin correlations and observe pronounced nodal-antinodal dichotomy in the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral functions. Furthermore, we investigate the temperature dependence of several commonly used observables in the model. As representative results, we achieve an accurate map of the thermal entropy across the crossover diagram, and identify the parameter regions in which the model exhibits the Pomeranchuk cooling, characterized by an adiabatic cooling with increasing $U$. Beyond offering a more refined understanding of the crossover phenomenon, our work also provides valuable benchmark and guideline for future optical lattice experiments on the square-lattice Hubbard model.

Abstract: We investigate lattice dynamics in LaCoO$_3$ using inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering over $T = 2\mbox{-}650\,\mathrm{K}$, spanning the spin-state crossover at $T_{1} \approx 100\,\mathrm{K}$ and the insulator--metal transition at $T_{2} \approx 550\,\mathrm{K}$. Comparison with quasi-harmonic $ab-initio$ lattice-dynamical calculations helps reveal anomalous softening of a $\approx 10\,\mathrm{meV}$ oxygen phonon, confined to the temperature interval $T_{1} \leq T \leq T_{2}$ and localized in momentum space at $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{SSO}} = \left( \frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2} \right)_{c}$. This wave vector corresponds to the spin-state ordering originally proposed by Goodenough [J. Phys. Chem. Solids 6, 287-297 (1958)]. Our results therefore provide momentum-resolved evidence for dynamic correlations of high-spin and low-spin Co$^{3+}$ states in LaCoO$_{3}$, linking spin-state fluctuations to anomalous phonon renormalization.

Abstract: Using the formalism of pseudospin and isospin operators the Hamiltonian of an effective Kugel-Khomskii model with spin-orbit coupling is derived with an exact account of the $t_{2g}$ multiplet splitting by the crystal field. An analytical solution is obtained for an arbitrary relation between the Hubbard repulsion and crystal field splitting, i.e., interpolating the cases of Mott-Hubbard and charge-transfer insulators. A description of orbital orders is given in terms of octupole moments. The ground-state phase diagram is constructed in the parameter space spanned by spin-orbit coupling, Hund's exchange, and Hubbard interaction. We investigate a quantum phase transition between a state exhibiting hidden magnetic and orbital long-range order and a ferromagnetic state with a reduced magnetic moment accompanied by antiferroorbital order. It is shown that the cooperative effect of Hund's and spin-orbit interactions gives rise to an easy-plane-type anisotropy.

TL;DR: Spin-3/2 ice exhibits novel Coulomb spin liquids with additional crystal-field excitations that cause dynamical arrest after thermal quenches, providing a rare disorder-free platform for unconventional phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how the enlarged on-site Hilbert space in classical spin-3/2 ice creates qualitatively new Coulomb spin liquid phases beyond conventional spin-1/2 ice.

Method: Investigated equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties through thermal quenches and analysis of spin autocorrelations in classical spin-3/2 ice models.

Result: The system hosts additional low-energy crystal-field excitations that interact with magnetic monopoles. After thermal quenches, it shows exponentially long-lived athermal plateaus in spin autocorrelations, indicating dynamical arrest. This arises from novel composite excitations and kinetically constrained relaxation pathways requiring activated processes.

Conclusion: Higher-spin ice serves as a fertile platform for realizing unconventional Coulomb spin liquids and disorder-free dynamical arrest, opening new avenues for studying complex phases in short-range interacting systems.

Abstract: We investigate Coulomb spin liquids in classical spin-3/2 ice and show that the enlarged on-site Hilbert space gives rise to a qualitatively new class of such phases. Beyond the conventional magnetic monopoles of spin-1/2 ice, the system hosts additional low-energy crystal-field excitations, whose interplay with monopoles significantly modifies both equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties. Following a thermal quench, we find a pronounced dynamical arrest manifested in an exponentially long-lived {athermal} plateau in spin autocorrelations. This constitutes a rare example of dynamical arrest in a short-range interacting, disorder-free system. We demonstrate that the arrested dynamics originate from novel composite excitation structures unique to spin-3/2 ice and from kinetically constrained relaxation pathways that require activated processes. Our results establish higher-spin ice as a fertile platform for realising unconventional Coulomb spin liquids and dynamical arrest without quenched disorder.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper identifies a novel regime in pyrochlore magnets where spin-orbit and crystal field effects create two low-lying magnetic doublets modeled as an effective S=3/2 system. It reveals two topologically distinct zero-field Coulomb phases separated by a first-order Z₃ confinement transition, with experimental predictions for systems exhibiting topological transitions at low temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the unique physics regime in pyrochlore magnets where spin-orbit coupling and crystal field effects produce two competing low-energy states, enabling the study of topological phase transitions in magnetic systems.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the T/J → 0 limit using w = exp(-μ/T) as the control variable, focusing on the competition between dominant antiferromagnetic exchange J and single-ion anisotropy Δ.

Result: Discovery of two topologically distinct zero-field Coulomb phases separated by a first-order Z₃ confinement transition at w_c ≈ 2.02. One phase restricts flux to integer multiples of 3 with only 3n charges deconfined, while the other allows all integer fluxes with all charges deconfined.

Conclusion: Experimental systems with small negative μ (-J ≪ μ < 0) should exhibit signatures of this topological transition when cooled below T_c ≈ 1.42|μ|, providing a measurable prediction for real pyrochlore magnet systems.

Abstract: We identify an interesting regime in the physics of pyrochlore magnets in which spin-orbit and crystal field effects lead to {\em two} low-lying magnetic doublets that can be modeled as an effective spin $S=3/2$ degree of freedom that sees a dominant easy-axis antiferromagnetic exchange $J>0$ favoring the local $[111]$ axes, which competes with a comparably strong single-ion anisotropy $Δ= J+μ/2$ (with $|μ| \ll J$) favoring the perpendicular planes. For a precise analysis, we study the $T/J \rightarrow 0$ limit in which $w \equiv \exp(-μ/T)$ is the control variable. In this limit, we find {\em two topologically distinct} zero-field Coulomb phases separated by a first-order $Z_3$ confinement transition at $w_c \approx 2.02$. Both Coulomb phases admit a description in terms of the fluctuations of a coarse-grained divergence-free polarization field. However, the flux of this polarization field is restricted to integer multiples of $3$, and only charges that are multiples of 3 are deconfined in one of these phases, while all integer fluxes are allowed and all integer charges are deconfined in the other phase. Experimental systems with small negative $μ$ ({\em i.e.}, $-J \ll μ< 0$) are therefore predicted to exhibit signatures of this topological transition when cooled below $T_c \approx 1.42|μ|$.

Abstract: We report an extremely rich ground state phase diagram of two spin-1 Haldane chains frustrated with a three-site exchange and coupled by the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction on a zig-zag ladder. A particular feature of the phase diagram is the extended quantum phase transition in the Ashkin-Teller universality class that separates the plaquette phase, which spontaneously breaks translation symmetry, and the uniform disordered phase. The former is connected to the Haldane phase, stabilized by large inter-chain coupling, via the topological Gaussian transition. Upon decreasing the inter-chain interactions, this intermediate disorder phase vanishes, giving place to a dimerized phase separated from the plaquette phase on one side via a non-magnetic Ising transition and from the Haldane phase on the other side by a topological weak first-order transition. Finally, in the limit of two decoupled chains, we recover a quantum critical point that corresponds to two copies of the Wess-Zumino-Witten $\mathrm{SU(2)}_2$ criticality with a total central charge $c=3$.

Conclusion: 这些化合物处于局域反演对称性破缺、各向异性晶体电场效应以及竞争Kondo和RKKY相互作用共同导致非常规磁序的体系中。

Abstract: The R3MBi5 rare-earth intermetallics (R = rare earth, M = Ti, Zr, Sc) provide a versatile platform to explore how Kondo hybridization, RKKY exchange, magnetic frustration, and broken inversion symmetry may cooperate to generate unusual magnetic behavior. We present a comprehensive neutron scattering investigation of the magnetic structure, crystal electric field (CEF), and low-energy excitations in the locally noncentrosymmetric Kondo-lattice compounds Ce3TiBi5 and Ce3ZrBi5. Powder and single-crystal neutron diffraction reveals incommensurate cycloidal antiferromagnetic order in Ce3TiBi5 with propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0.388) and a reduced ordered moment of m = 0.53(3)$μ_{B}$. Ce3ZrBi5 exhibits a qualitatively similar magnetic diffraction profile, with k $\simeq$ (0, 0, 0.37). Inelastic neutron scattering measurements resolve two clear, well-separated CEF excitations in both compounds with nearly the same profile, confirming a well-isolated Kramers doublet ground state. At low energies, a broad, quasi-elastic magnetic response is observed at T $\simeq$ TN, whose momentum-dependence is inconsistent with that expected from conventional collective excitations of localized moments. This discrepancy, along with a Kondo temperature estimate TK ~ 3--5 K -- comparable to TN -- indicates sizable Kondo hybridization, which accounts for the moment reduction and the spiral magnetic order that appears to involve the magnetic hard direction. Our results place these compounds in a regime where local inversion symmetry breaking, anisotropic CEF effects, and competing Kondo and RKKY interactions collectively give rise to unconventional magnetic order.

### [57] [Improving Spatial Allocation for Energy System Coupling with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22249)
*Xuanhao Mu,Jakob Geiges,Nan Liu,Thorsten Schlachter,Veit Hagenmeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network method to generate physically meaningful weights for aggregating high-resolution geographic units in energy system models, overcoming limitations of traditional single-attribute Voronoi-based allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional energy system models face challenges in coupling models with mismatched spatial resolutions, as existing aggregation methods rely on only a single geospatial attribute (e.g., geographic proximity), limiting accuracy and physical plausibility.

Method: The authors develop a self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network that models high-resolution geographic units as graph nodes, integrates multiple geographical features to generate optimized weights for each grid point, and enhances Voronoi-based allocation beyond simple proximity metrics.

Result: Experimental results show the method significantly improves scalability, accuracy, physical plausibility, and precision of cluster-based Voronoi Diagrams compared to traditional single-attribute aggregation approaches, while overcoming ground-truth data scarcity via self-supervised learning.

Conclusion: This HGNN-based weighting approach enables more robust spatial resolution coupling in energy system analysis by incorporating multidimensional geographic information, offering a scalable solution for physically realistic model integration without requiring labeled training data.

Abstract: In energy system analysis, coupling models with mismatched spatial resolutions is a significant challenge. A common solution is assigning weights to high-resolution geographic units for aggregation, but traditional models are limited by using only a single geospatial attribute. This paper presents an innovative method employing a self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to address this issue. This method models high-resolution geographic units as graph nodes, integrating various geographical features to generate physically meaningful weights for each grid point. These weights enhance the conventional Voronoi-based allocation method, allowing it to go beyond simply geographic proximity by incorporating essential geographic information.In addition, the self-supervised learning paradigm overcomes the lack of accurate ground-truth data. Experimental results demonstrate that applying weights generated by this method to cluster-based Voronoi Diagrams significantly enhances scalability, accuracy, and physical plausibility, while increasing precision compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Can an LLM learn how an optimizer behaves -- and use that knowledge to control it? We extend Code World Models (CWMs), LLM-synthesized Python programs that predict environment dynamics, from deterministic games to stochastic combinatorial optimization. Given suboptimal trajectories of $(1{+}1)$-$\text{RLS}_k$, the LLM synthesizes a simulator of the optimizer's dynamics; greedy planning over this simulator then selects the mutation strength $k$ at each step. On \lo{} and \onemax{}, CWM-greedy performs within 6\% of the theoretically optimal policy -- without ever seeing optimal-policy trajectories. On \jump{$_k$}, where a deceptive valley causes all adaptive baselines to fail (0\% success rate), CWM-greedy achieves 100\% success rate -- without any collection policy using oracle knowledge of the gap parameter. On the NK-Landscape, where no closed-form model exists, CWM-greedy outperforms all baselines across fifteen independently generated instances ($36.94$ vs.\ $36.32$; $p<0.001$) when the prompt includes empirical transition statistics. The CWM also outperforms DQN in sample efficiency (200 offline trajectories vs.\ 500 online episodes), success rate (100\% vs.\ 58\%), and generalization ($k{=}3$: 78\% vs.\ 0\%). Robustness experiments confirm stable synthesis across 5 independent runs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型能耗日益增长，当前"一刀切"的推理策略将所有请求路由到同一大型模型，造成严重能源浪费，亟需实现可持续AI系统。

Method: 提出上下文感知模型切换方法，结合缓存、基于规则复杂度评分、机器学习分类和用户自适应组件；在真实对话工作负载上评估三个不同计算成本的开源模型(Gemma3 1B/4B和Qwen3 4B)，通过NVML GPU功耗遥测测量能耗、响应延迟、路由准确率和输出质量(BERTScore F1)。

Conclusion: 模型切换推理为实现更节能、可持续的AI系统提供了实用可扩展的路径，可在不显著牺牲质量的前提下实现显著效率提升。

Abstract: Large language models have become central to many AI applications, but their growing energy consumption raises serious sustainability concerns. A key limitation in current AI deployments is the reliance on a one-size-fits-all inference strategy where most systems route every request to the same large model, regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial and unnecessary energy waste. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects an appropriate language model based on query complexity. The proposed system uses a Context-Aware Model Switching for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference that combines caching for repeated queries, rulebased complexity scoring for fast and explainable decisions, machine learning classification to capture semantic intent, and a user-adaptive component that learns from interaction patterns over time. The proposed architecture was evaluated using real conversation workloads and three open-source language models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B and Qwen3 4B) with different computational costs, measuring energy consumption (via NVML GPU power telemetry), response latency, routing accuracy, and output quality (BERTScore F1) to reflect real-world usage conditions. Experimental results show that the model switching approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 67.5% compared to always using the largest model while maintaining a response quality of 93.6%. In addition, the response time for simple queries also improved significantly by approximately 68%. These results show that model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating that significant efficiency gains can be achieved without major sacrifices in response quality.

Motivation: 标准流匹配目标无法直接控制轨迹的信息几何结构，导致低熵瓶颈现象，造成语义模态的瞬时耗尽和模式崩溃问题

Method: 构建熵控流匹配(ECFM)约束变分原理，在连续性方程路径上施加全局熵率预算约束d/dt H(mu_t) >= -lambda，形成Wasserstein空间中的凸优化问题，并建立与Schrödinger桥及熵乘子的随机控制表示等价关系

Result: 1) 纯输运 regime下恢复熵正则化最优传输测地线 2) 当lambda→0时Gamma收敛至经典最优传输 3) 获得Lipschitz稳定的证书式模式覆盖与密度下限保证 4) 为无约束流匹配构建近最优崩溃反例

Conclusion: ECFM通过显式熵控制有效缓解模式崩溃问题，在保持理论严谨性的同时提供可证明的模态覆盖保证，为视觉生成模型提供更鲁棒的流匹配框架

Abstract: Modern vision generators transport a base distribution to data through time-indexed measures, implemented as deterministic flows (ODEs) or stochastic diffusions (SDEs). Despite strong empirical performance, standard flow-matching objectives do not directly control the information geometry of the trajectory, allowing low-entropy bottlenecks that can transiently deplete semantic modes. We propose Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching (ECFM): a constrained variational principle over continuity-equation paths enforcing a global entropy-rate budget d/dt H(mu_t) >= -lambda. ECFM is a convex optimization in Wasserstein space with a KKT/Pontryagin system, and admits a stochastic-control representation equivalent to a Schrodinger bridge with an explicit entropy multiplier. In the pure transport regime, ECFM recovers entropic OT geodesics and Gamma-converges to classical OT as lambda -> 0. We further obtain certificate-style mode-coverage and density-floor guarantees with Lipschitz stability, and construct near-optimal collapse counterexamples for unconstrained flow matching.

Abstract: The real-time supervision of production processes is a common challenge across several industries. It targets process component monitoring and its predictive maintenance in order to ensure safety, uninterrupted production and maintain high efficiency level. The rise of advanced tools for the simulation of physical systems in addition to data-driven machine learning models offers the possibility to design numerical tools dedicated to efficient system monitoring. In that respect, the digital twin concept presents an adequate framework that proffers solution to these challenges. The main purpose of this paper is to develop such a digital twin dedicated to fault detection and diagnosis in the context of a thermal-hydraulic process supervision. Based on a numerical simulation of the system, in addition to machine learning methods, we propose different modules dedicated to process parameter change detection and their on-line estimation. The proposed fault detection and diagnosis algorithm is validated on a specific test scenario, with single one-off parameter change occurrences in the system. The numerical results show good accuracy in terms of parameter variation localization and the update of their values.

TL;DR: 提出AutoQRA框架，通过两阶段联合优化每层的量化位宽和LoRA秩配置，在相同显存预算下实现接近全精度微调的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化与参数高效微调（LoRA）的串行流程未能利用量化位宽与LoRA秩之间的复杂交互关系，导致优化后的量化分配不一定转化为良好的微调性能，且不同配置在相同显存预算下表现差异显著。

Method: 提出两阶段优化框架：第一阶段采用多保真度进化搜索，注入层重要性先验初始化种群，并使用特定算子和性能模型高效筛选候选配置；第二阶段应用信赖域贝叶斯优化，局部精细化搜索有希望区域，实现训练过程中对量化噪声的主动补偿。

Result: 实验表明，AutoQRA在显存占用与均匀4-bit方法相当的情况下，性能接近全精度微调。

Conclusion: AutoQRA成功解决了量化与LoRA秩的联合优化问题，通过协同优化策略有效平衡了显存约束和模型性能，为资源受限下的模型适配提供了新方案。

Abstract: Quantization followed by parameter-efficient fine-tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation under tight GPU memory constraints. However, this sequential pipeline fails to leverage the intricate interaction between quantization bit-width and LoRA rank. Specifically, a carefully optimized quantization allocation with low quantization error does not always translate to strong fine-tuning performance, and different bit-width and rank configurations can lead to significantly varying outcomes under the same memory budget. To address this limitation, we propose AutoQRA, a joint optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes the bit-width and LoRA rank configuration for each layer during the mixed quantized fine-tuning process. To tackle the challenges posed by the large discrete search space and the high evaluation cost associated with frequent fine-tuning iterations, AutoQRA decomposes the optimization process into two stages. First, it first conducts a global multi-fidelity evolutionary search, where the initial population is warm-started by injecting layer-wise importance priors. This stage employs specific operators and a performance model to efficiently screen candidate configurations. Second, trust-region Bayesian optimization is applied to locally refine promising regions of the search space and identify optimal configurations under the given memory budget. This approach enables active compensation for quantization noise in specific layers during training. Experiments show that AutoQRA achieves performance close to full-precision fine-tuning with a memory footprint comparable to uniform 4-bit methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子安全聚合(QSA)虽提供信息论隐私，但依赖大规模GHZ态导致保真度随客户端数量增加而急剧下降，且全局聚合机制无法识别恶意客户端，限制了其在真实量子硬件上的应用。

Method: 提出Clustered Quantum Secure Aggregation (CQSA)，将客户端随机划分为小簇，每簇使用高保真度低量子比特GHZ态进行本地量子聚合；服务器通过余弦相似度和欧氏距离等统计度量分析簇间聚合结果，识别恶意贡献。

Result: 理论分析和去极化噪声模拟表明，CQSA相比全局QSA能保持稳定的模型收敛性，并获得更高的量子态保真度，同时具备拜占庭鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CQSA框架通过模块化设计平衡了近量子硬件的物理约束与联邦学习的安全需求，为可扩展的量子安全联邦学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. However, shared local model updates remain vulnerable to inference and poisoning attacks. Secure aggregation schemes have been proposed to mitigate these attacks. In this work, we aim to understand how these techniques are implemented in quantum-assisted FL. Quantum Secure Aggregation (QSA) has been proposed, offering information-theoretic privacy by encoding client updates into the global phase of multipartite entangled states. Existing QSA protocols, however, rely on a single global Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state shared among all participating clients. This design poses fundamental challenges: fidelity of large-scale GHZ states deteriorates rapidly with the increasing number of clients; and (ii) the global aggregation prevents the detection of Byzantine clients. We propose Clustered Quantum Secure Aggregation (CQSA), a modular aggregation framework that reconciles the physical constraints of near-term quantum hardware along with the need for Byzantine-robustness in FL. CQSA randomly partitions the clients into small clusters, each performing local quantum aggregation using high-fidelity, low-qubit GHZ states. The server analyzes statistical relationships between cluster-level aggregates employing common statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Euclidean distance to identify malicious contributions. Through theoretical analysis and simulations under depolarizing noise, we demonstrate that CQSA ensures stable model convergence, achieves superior state fidelity over global QSA.

Conclusion: STOEP successfully addresses key limitations in epidemic forecasting by integrating data-driven and expert knowledge through its three-component architecture, demonstrating significant performance improvements and practical utility in real-world public health management.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting is critical for public health management, yet existing methods often struggle with insensitivity to weak epidemic signals, over-simplified spatial relations, and unstable parameter estimation. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal priOr-aware Epidemic Predictor (STOEP), a novel hybrid framework that integrates implicit spatio-temporal priors and explicit expert priors. STOEP consists of three key components: (1) Case-aware Adjacency Learning (CAL), which dynamically adjusts mobility-based regional dependencies using historical infection patterns; (2) Space-informed Parameter Estimating (SPE), which employs learnable spatial priors to amplify weak epidemic signals; and (3) Filter-based Mechanistic Forecasting (FMF), which uses an expert-guided adaptive thresholding strategy to regularize epidemic parameters. Extensive experiments on real-world COVID-19 and influenza datasets demonstrate that STOEP outperforms the best baseline by 11.1% in RMSE. The system has been deployed at one provincial CDC in China to facilitate downstream applications.

Conclusion: 该概率框架既提供了对注意力机制的理论洞察（边界约束、支撑token），又通过简单的损失修改在实践中有用，能训练更鲁棒的LLM模型。

Abstract: Self-attention is usually described as a flexible, content-adaptive way to mix a token with information from its past. We re-interpret causal self-attention transformers, the backbone of modern foundation models, within a probabilistic framework, much like how classical PCA is extended to probabilistic PCA. However, this re-formulation reveals a surprising and deeper structural insight: due to a change-of-variables phenomenon, a barrier constraint emerges on the self-attention parameters. This induces a highly structured geometry on the token space, providing theoretical insights into the dynamics of LLM decoding. This reveals a boundary where attention becomes ill-conditioned, leading to a margin interpretation similar to classical support vector machines. Just like support vectors, this naturally gives rise to the concept of support tokens.
  Furthermore, we show that LLMs can be interpreted as a stochastic process over the power set of the token space, providing a rigorous probabilistic framework for sequence modeling. We propose a Bayesian framework and derive a MAP estimation objective that requires only a minimal modification to standard LLM training: the addition of a smooth log-barrier penalty to the usual cross-entropy loss. We demonstrate that this provides more robust models without sacrificing out-of-sample accuracy and that it is straightforward to incorporate in practice.

Abstract: AI-native architectures are vital for 6G wireless communications. The black-box nature and high complexity of deep learning models employed in critical applications, such as channel estimation, limit their practical deployment. While perturbation-based XAI solutions offer input filtering, they often neglect internal structural optimization. We propose X-REFINE, an XAI-based framework for joint input-filtering and architecture fine-tuning. By utilizing a decomposition-based, sign-stabilized LRP epsilon rule, X-REFINE backpropagates predictions to derive high-resolution relevance scores for both subcarriers and hidden neurons. This enables a holistic optimization that identifies the most faithful model components. Simulation results demonstrate that X-REFINE achieves a superior interpretability-performance-complexity trade-off, significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining robust bit error rate (BER) performance across different scenarios.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death globally, necessitating early identification, precise risk classification, and dependable decision-support technologies. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides new zero-shot and few-shot reasoning capabilities, even though machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially ensemble approaches like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are excellent at modeling complex, non-linear patient data and routinely beat logistic regression. This research predicts cardiovascular disease using a merged dataset of 1,190 patient records, comparing traditional machine learning models (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96) with open-source large language models via OpenRouter APIs. Finally, a hybrid fusion of the ML ensemble and LLM reasoning under Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the best results (96.62% accuracy, 0.97 AUC), showing that LLMs (78.9 % accuracy) work best when combined with ML models rather than used alone. Results show that ML ensembles achieved the highest performance (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96), while LLMs performed moderately in zero-shot (78.9%) and slightly better in few-shot (72.6%) settings. The proposed hybrid method enhanced the strength in uncertain situations, illustrating that ensemble ML is considered the best structured tabular prediction case, but it can be integrated with hybrid ML-LLM systems to provide a minor increase and open the way to more reliable clinical decision-support tools.

Motivation: 当前临床试验风险管理多为事后响应，亟需在试验启动前预测给药错误高风险试验。给药错误严重影响受试者安全，但现有方法缺乏利用多模态数据的前瞻性风险分层工具。

Method: 从ClinicalTrials.gov构建42,112项试验数据集，整合结构化数据、半结构化数据和协议文本。通过不良事件报告、MedDRA术语和Wilson置信区间定义给药错误高风险标签。对比XGBoost（结构化特征）、ClinicalModernBERT（文本）和晚期融合模型，并应用概率校准实现风险分层。

Result: 晚期融合模型表现最佳（AUC-ROC=0.862）。校准后的模型能可靠划分风险等级，高风险组中实际高错误率试验比例随预测风险单调上升，验证了风险分层的有效性。

Conclusion: 成功建立可推广的ML框架，通过试验前信息预测给药错误风险。简单多模态融合即提升性能，概率校准使输出具备临床可解释性，支持临床试验主动质量管理和受试者安全保护。

Abstract: Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a machine learning (ML)-based framework for early risk stratification of clinical trials (CTs) according to their likelihood of exhibiting a high rate of dosing errors, using information available prior to trial initiation. Materials and Methods: We constructed a dataset from ClinicalTrials.gov comprising 42,112 CTs. Structured, semi-structured trial data, and unstructured protocol-related free-text data were extracted. CTs were assigned binary labels indicating elevated dosing error rate, derived from adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. We evaluated an XGBoost model trained on structured features, a ClinicalModernBERT model using textual data, and a simple late-fusion model combining both modalities. Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures. Conclusion: This study introduces a reproducible and scalable ML framework for early, trial-level risk stratification of CTs at risk of high dosing error rates, supporting proactive, risk-based quality management in clinical research.

Motivation: 猝死(SCD)难以预测，传统AI模型作为"黑箱"缺乏透明度，启发式解释方法无法保证正确性，影响临床信任和部署

Method: 将具有正确性保证的逻辑基可解释性方法应用于一个准确率和召回率均超过95%的AI分类器，用于预测恰加斯心肌病猝死风险

Result: 实现了100%解释保真度，预测性能优异；相比主流启发式方法，在一致性和鲁棒性方面表现更优

Conclusion: 该方法增强临床信任，促进AI工具在恰加斯病流行地区的大规模应用，满足最迫切医疗需求

Abstract: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is unpredictable, and its prediction in Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) remains a significant challenge, especially in patients not classified as high risk. While AI and machine learning models improve risk stratification, their adoption is hindered by a lack of transparency, as they are often perceived as \textit{black boxes} with unclear decision-making processes. Some approaches apply heuristic explanations without correctness guarantees, leading to mistakes in the decision-making process. To address this, we apply a logic-based explainability method with correctness guarantees to the problem of SCD prediction in CC. This explainability method, applied to an AI classifier with over 95\% accuracy and recall, demonstrated strong predictive performance and 100\% explanation fidelity. When compared to state-of-the-art heuristic methods, it showed superior consistency and robustness. This approach enhances clinical trust, facilitates the integration of AI-driven tools into practice, and promotes large-scale deployment, particularly in endemic regions where it is most needed.

TL;DR: 提出系统性映射大语言模型"失效流形"的框架，将漏洞搜索重构为质量多样性问题，使用MAP-Elites算法发现不同模型的失效拓扑结构差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究聚焦于修复对抗样本，但缺乏对不安全区域本身的系统性刻画。理解AI安全需要映射模型失效的全局拓扑结构。

Method: 将漏洞发现重构为质量多样性问题，采用MAP-Elites算法和"对齐偏差"指标，搜索行为偏离预期对齐的区域，揭示连续的行为吸引盆地。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B、GPT-OSS-20B和GPT-5-Mini上实现最高63%行为覆盖率，发现最多370个脆弱点。揭示三种不同失效拓扑：Llama-3呈现通用脆弱高原，GPT-OSS-20B为碎片化集中盆地，GPT-5-Mini表现强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法生成可解释的安全景观全局地图，超越现有攻击方法(GCG/PAIR/TAP)，将范式从寻找离散失败转向理解其底层结构。

Abstract: While prior work has focused on projecting adversarial examples back onto the manifold of natural data to restore safety, we argue that a comprehensive understanding of AI safety requires characterizing the unsafe regions themselves. This paper introduces a framework for systematically mapping the Manifold of Failure in Large Language Models (LLMs). We reframe the search for vulnerabilities as a quality diversity problem, using MAP-Elites to illuminate the continuous topology of these failure regions, which we term behavioral attraction basins. Our quality metric, Alignment Deviation, guides the search towards areas where the model's behavior diverges most from its intended alignment. Across three LLMs: Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, and GPT-5-Mini, we show that MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B exhibits a near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows a fragmented landscape with spatially concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with a ceiling at 0.50. Our approach produces interpretable, global maps of each model's safety landscape that no existing attack method (GCG, PAIR, or TAP) can provide, shifting the paradigm from finding discrete failures to understanding their underlying structure.

TL;DR: AI foundation model for global river simulation without historical data


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: River systems require interconnected simulation but data scarcity limits predictions to isolated points; existing methods struggle with ungauged rivers and error accumulation.

Method: GraphRiverCast (GRC): topology-informed AI model using graph neural networks with "ColdStart" mode, physics-aligned neural operators, and pre-training/fine-tuning adaptation.

Result: Achieved 0.82 Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency in 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts without historical data; topological encoding prevented error accumulation and outperformed physics-based/AI baselines.

Conclusion: Topology encoding is essential for systemic river simulation; GRC enables rapid cross-scale adaptation, bridging global knowledge with local hydrology through physics-informed foundation modeling.

Abstract: River systems operate as inherently interconnected continuous networks, meaning river hydrodynamic simulation ought to be a systemic process. However, widespread hydrology data scarcity often restricts data-driven forecasting to isolated predictions. To achieve systemic simulation and reduce reliance on river observations, we present GraphRiverCast (GRC), a topology-informed AI foundation model designed to simulate multivariate river hydrodynamics in global river systems. GRC is capable of operating in a "ColdStart" mode, generating predictions without relying on historical river states for initialization. In 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts, GRC-ColdStart functions as a robust standalone simulator, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of approximately 0.82 without exhibiting the significant error accumulation typical of autoregressive paradigms. Ablation studies reveal that topological encoding serves as indispensable structural information in the absence of historical states, explicitly guiding hydraulic connectivity and network-scale mass redistribution to reconstruct flow dynamics. Furthermore, when adapted locally via a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, GRC consistently outperforms physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines. Crucially, this superiority extends from gauged reaches to full river networks, underscoring the necessity of topology encoding and physics-based pre-training. Built on a physics-aligned neural operator architecture, GRC enables rapid and cross-scale adaptive simulation, establishing a collaborative paradigm bridging global hydrodynamic knowledge with local hydrological reality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出PECT——一种基于能量的动态信号概念稳定性框架，通过能量约束表示学习区分真实概念漂移与良性生理变异，在保持准确率的同时显著提升多模态心电图模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念漂移框架多为分布方法，缺乏对生理信号能量合理波动时模型内部表示变化的原则性指导，导致深度学习模型将无害的振幅、频率或形态变化误判为概念漂移，造成预测不稳定，尤其在多模态融合场景下问题更突出。

Method: 提出生理能量守恒理论(PECT)，认为在虚拟漂移下，归一化潜在位移应与归一化信号能量变化成比例；该比例关系的持续违反表明真实概念漂移。通过能量约束表示学习(ECRL)实现，这是一种轻量级正则化方法，在不改变编码器结构或增加推理成本的前提下，惩罚能量不一致的潜在空间移动。

Result: 在七种单模态和混合模态心电图模型上评估显示：最强三模态混合模型(1D+2D+Transformer)的干净准确率基本保持(96.0%至94.1%)，扰动准确率大幅提升(72.6%至85.5%)，融合表示漂移减少超过45%，所有架构均呈现相似趋势。

Conclusion: PECT作为一种能量-漂移法则，能有效指导连续生理信号中的概念稳定性，为区分真实概念漂移与良性生理波动提供了原则性方法，使多模态模型更加稳定和鲁棒。

Abstract: Models operating on dynamic physiologic signals must distinguish benign, label-preserving variability from true concept change. Existing concept-drift frameworks are largely distributional and provide no principled guidance on how much a model's internal representation may move when the underlying signal undergoes physiologically plausible fluctuations in energy. As a result, deep models often misinterpret harmless changes in amplitude, rate, or morphology as concept drift, yielding unstable predictions, particularly in multimodal fusion settings.
  This study introduces Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT), an energy-based framework for concept stability in dynamic signals. PECT posits that under virtual drift, normalized latent displacement should scale proportionally with normalized signal energy change, while persistent violations of this proportionality indicate real concept drift. We operationalize this principle through Energy-Constrained Representation Learning (ECRL), a lightweight regularizer that penalizes energy-inconsistent latent movement without modifying encoder architectures or adding inference-time cost.
  Although PECT is formulated for dynamic signals in general, we instantiate and evaluate it on multimodal ECG across seven unimodal and hybrid models. Experiments show that in the strongest trimodal hybrid (1D+2D+Transformer), clean accuracy is largely preserved (96.0% to 94.1%), while perturbed accuracy improves substantially (72.6% to 85.5%) and fused representation drift decreases by over 45%. Similar trends are observed across all architectures, providing empirical evidence that PECT functions as an energy-drift law governing concept stability in continuous physiologic signals.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将机械故障诊断（MFD）重构为离线逆向强化学习问题，通过对抗性逆向强化学习训练判别器区分正常与异常运行状态，利用判别器输出的奖励值作为异常分数实现无监督故障检测，在三个基准数据集上验证了早期故障检测的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的机械故障诊断方法未能充分利用RL的序列决策特性，多将MFD简化为上下文赌博机问题（静态猜测），而实际故障检测需建模设备运行的时序动态特性。

Method: 1. 将MFD建模为离线逆向强化学习问题：从健康运行序列中直接学习奖励函数，避免人工设计奖励和故障标签；
2. 采用对抗性逆向强化学习框架：训练判别器区分专家（正常）数据与策略生成数据，判别器输出的奖励值作为异常分数；
3. 通过偏离正常行为的程度实现故障检测。

Result: 在HUMS2023、IMS和XJTU-SY三个运行至故障基准数据集上，模型对正常样本持续输出低异常分数，对故障样本输出高异常分数，实现了早期、稳健的故障检测。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将RL的序列推理能力与MFD的时序结构对齐，为数据驱动的工业场景提供了无需故障标签的RL诊断新路径，验证了逆向强化学习在设备健康管理中的可行性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers significant promise for machinery fault detection (MFD). However, most existing RL-based MFD approaches do not fully exploit RL's sequential decision-making strengths, often treating MFD as a simple guessing game (Contextual Bandits). To bridge this gap, we formulate MFD as an offline inverse reinforcement learning problem, where the agent learns the reward dynamics directly from healthy operational sequences, thereby bypassing the need for manual reward engineering and fault labels. Our framework employs Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to train a discriminator that distinguishes between normal (expert) and policy-generated transitions. The discriminator's learned reward serves as an anomaly score, indicating deviations from normal operating behaviour. When evaluated on three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), the model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, enabling early and robust fault detection. By aligning RL's sequential reasoning with MFD's temporal structure, this work opens a path toward RL-based diagnostics in data-driven industrial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI可能隐藏目标逃避监督，对齐训练可能失败且有副作用，需新方法降低错配风险。

Method: 训练GPT-4.1和Gemini-2.0调用report_scheming()工具自报欺骗行为，在分布外环境测试未检测伤害能力，对比监控器与对齐基线。

Result: 该方法显著降低未检测攻击率，优于基线，保持指令层级且对通用能力影响小，性能跨任务一致，可抵御对抗性提示并泛化到自主作恶场景。

Conclusion: 自证其罪是降低前沿AI错配风险的可行路径，不依赖预防或外部检测。

Abstract: Frontier AI agents may pursue hidden goals while concealing their pursuit from oversight. Alignment training aims to prevent such behavior by reinforcing the correct goals, but alignment may not always succeed and can lead to unwanted side effects. We propose self-incrimination training, which instead trains agents to produce a visible signal when they covertly misbehave. We train GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.0 agents to call a report_scheming() tool when behaving deceptively and measure their ability to cause harm undetected in out-of-distribution environments. Self-incrimination significantly reduces the undetected successful attack rate, outperforming matched-capability monitors and alignment baselines while preserving instruction hierarchy and incurring minimal safety tax on general capabilities. Unlike blackbox monitoring, self-incrimination performance is consistent across tasks regardless of how suspicious the misbehavior appears externally. The trained behavior persists under adversarial prompt optimization and generalizes to settings where agents pursue misaligned goals themselves rather than being instructed to misbehave. Our results suggest self-incrimination offers a viable path for reducing frontier misalignment risk, one that neither assumes misbehavior can be prevented nor that it can be reliably classified from the outside.

TL;DR: This thesis develops a unified spectral geometry and random matrix theory framework to tackle deep learning reliability and efficiency by analyzing eigenvalue dynamics, proposing EigenTrack for hallucination detection and RMT-KD for model compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling deep networks and LLMs become increasingly opaque with hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and unsustainable computational/energy demands, requiring interpretable monitoring of internal representations.

Method: Analyzes eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers using spectral statistics (entropy, variance, Marchenko-Pastur deviations) to separate causal representations from noise via spectral geometry and random matrix theory.

Result: Two key contributions: (1) EigenTrack enables real-time hallucination/OOD detection in LLMs using lightweight recurrent classifiers on streaming spectral descriptors; (2) RMT-KD achieves principled model compression via iterative self-distillation, projecting networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces while preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: Spectral analysis provides a compact, stable, and interpretable lens for model behavior, enabling early detection of reliability failures before output generation and yielding significantly more compact, energy-efficient models with hardware-friendly dense structures.

Abstract: This thesis addresses two persistent and closely related challenges in modern deep learning, reliability and efficiency, through a unified framework grounded in Spectral Geometry and Random Matrix Theory (RMT). As deep networks and large language models continue to scale, their internal behavior becomes increasingly opaque, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational and energy demands. By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers and inputs, this work shows that spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior, capable of separating structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. Within this framework, the first contribution, EigenTrack, introduces a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in large language and vision-language models. EigenTrack transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors such as entropy, variance, and deviations from the Marchenko-Pastur baseline, and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers, enabling early detection of reliability failures before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics. The second contribution, RMT-KD, presents a principled approach to compressing deep networks via random matrix theoretic knowledge distillation. By interpreting outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as carriers of task-relevant information, RMT-KD progressively projects networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces through iterative self-distillation, yielding significantly more compact and energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and dense, hardware-friendly structure.

Motivation: 生物高维数据中的目标信号常被跨条件的优势变异（基线生物学结构或技术效应）掩盖，标准降维方法难以解析条件特异性结构。现有背景校正方法存在两大局限：无法扩展到高维数据，或缺乏可解释性。亟需一种既能有效分离混杂因素，又具备高效计算性能和特征级可解释性的新方法。

Method: 提出背景对比非负矩阵分解（bcNMF）：1）同时分解目标数据集和匹配背景数据；2）使用共享的非负基矩阵，但不同系数矩阵；3）通过对比学习目标函数抑制背景表达的结构，分离目标特异性变异；4）采用基于矩阵乘法的乘性更新算法，支持GPU并行和minibatch训练，实现大数据可扩展性。非负约束确保结果可直接在特征层面解释。

Result: 在模拟数据和四个真实生物数据集中验证了bcNMF的有效性：1）抑郁症患者死后大脑单细胞RNA-seq数据中识别出疾病相关程序；2）小鼠蛋白表达数据中发现基因型相关模式；3）白血病数据中揭示治疗特异性转录变化；4）癌症细胞系中解析出TP53依赖的药物反应。这些信号均被传统方法所掩盖。方法展现出高效计算性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: bcNMF是一种兼具可解释性、计算效率和可扩展性的创新计算方法，能够有效解决高维生物数据中背景变异掩盖目标信号的核心挑战。该方法成功应用于多种组学数据，揭示了重要的生物学见解，为精准解析复杂生物信号提供了有力工具，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Biological signals of interest in high-dimensional data are often masked by dominant variation shared across conditions. This variation, arising from baseline biological structure or technical effects, can prevent standard dimensionality reduction methods from resolving condition-specific structure. The challenge is that these confounding topics are often unknown and mixed with biological signals. Existing background correction methods are either unscalable to high dimensions or not interpretable. We introduce background contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (\model), which extracts target-enriched latent topics by jointly factorizing a target dataset and a matched background using shared non-negative bases under a contrastive objective that suppresses background-expressed structure. This approach yields non-negative components that are directly interpretable at the feature level, and explicitly isolates target-specific variation. \model is learned by an efficient multiplicative update algorithm via matrix multiplication such that it is highly efficient on GPU hardware and scalable to big data via minibatch training akin to deep learning approach. Across simulations and diverse biological datasets, \model reveals signals obscured by conventional methods, including disease-associated programs in postmortem depressive brain single-cell RNA-seq, genotype-linked protein expression patterns in mice, treatment-specific transcriptional changes in leukemia, and TP53-dependent drug responses in cancer cell lines.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个可解释的机器学习框架，用于通过临床特征和抗生素药敏模式预测细菌的多重耐药性（MDR）。XGBoost和LightGBM模型表现最佳，LIME解释器识别出喹诺酮类、复方新诺明、粘菌素、氨基糖苷类和呋喃类药物耐药性是最关键的预测因子。

Motivation: 抗菌药物耐药性（AMR）特别是多重耐药性（MDR）的兴起给临床决策带来严峻挑战，因为传统药敏试验耗时长且治疗选择有限。亟需快速准确的预测方法来支持抗菌药物管理。

Method: 评估了五种分类模型（逻辑回归、随机森林、AdaBoost、XGBoost、LightGBM），在9,714个细菌分离株的精选数据集上进行训练。将耐药性编码为抗生素家族水平以捕捉交叉耐药模式。使用准确率、F1分数、AUC-ROC和Matthews相关系数评估性能，并应用LIME生成实例级解释。

Result: 集成模型（特别是XGBoost和LightGBM）在所有指标上均表现出卓越的预测能力。LIME分析确定了对喹诺酮类、复方新诺明、粘菌素、氨基糖苷类和呋喃类的耐药性是MDR预测的最强贡献因素，与已知生物学机制一致。

Abstract: The rise of Antimicrobial Resistance, particularly Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR), presents a critical challenge for clinical decision-making due to limited treatment options and delays in conventional susceptibility testing. This study proposes an interpretable machine learning framework to predict MDR in bacterial isolates using clinical features and antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Five classification models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The models were trained on a curated dataset of 9,714 isolates, with resistance encoded at the antibiotic family level to capture cross-class resistance patterns consistent with MDR definitions. Performance assessment included accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Ensemble models, particularly XGBoost and LightGBM, demonstrated superior predictive capability across all metrics. To address the clinical transparency gap, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) was applied to generate instance-level explanations. LIME identified resistance to quinolones, Co-trimoxazole, Colistin, aminoglycosides, and Furanes as the strongest contributors to MDR predictions, aligning with known biological mechanisms. The results show that combining high-performing models with local interpretability provides both accuracy and actionable insights for antimicrobial stewardship. This framework supports earlier MDR identification and enhances trust in machine learning-assisted clinical decision support.

TL;DR: MolFM-Lite是一个多模态分子性质预测模型，通过联合编码1D SELFIES序列、2D分子图和3D构象集合，结合交叉注意力融合和实验条件调制，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子性质预测模型通常依赖单一分子表示（序列、图或3D结构）并将分子几何视为静态，忽略了多模态信息的互补性和分子构象的热力学分布。

Method: 1) 提出构象集合注意力机制，结合可学习注意力和玻尔兹曼加权先验处理多个RDKit生成的构象；2) 设计交叉模态融合层实现模态间信息互补；3) 使用特征线性调制(FiLM)整合实验上下文；4) 通过跨模态对比和掩码原子目标在ZINC250K上进行预训练。

Result: 在四个MoleculeNet支架分割基准测试中，三模态融合相比单模态基线提升7-11% AUC，构象集合相比单构象提升约2% AUC。所有基线在同协议下重新评估，消融研究证实各组件独立贡献。

Conclusion: 该多模态方法有效整合了分子不同层次表示和动态构象信息，通过适当的预训练策略实现了高性能分子性质预测，代码和模型已开源以保证可重复性。

Abstract: Most machine learning models for molecular property prediction rely on a single molecular representation (either a sequence, a graph, or a 3D structure) and treat molecular geometry as static. We present MolFM-Lite, a multi-modal model that jointly encodes SELFIES sequences (1D), molecular graphs (2D), and conformer ensembles (3D) through cross-attention fusion, while conditioning predictions on experimental context via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). Our main methodological contributions are: (1) a conformer ensemble attention mechanism that combines learnable attention with Boltzmann-weighted priors over multiple RDKit-generated conformers, capturing the thermodynamic distribution of molecular shapes; and (2) a cross-modal fusion layer where each modality can attend to others, enabling complementary information sharing. We evaluate on four MoleculeNet scaffold-split benchmarks using our model's own splits, and report all baselines re-evaluated under the same protocol. Comprehensive ablation studies across all four datasets confirm that each architectural component contributes independently, with tri-modal fusion providing 7-11% AUC improvement over single-modality baselines and conformer ensembles adding approximately 2% over single-conformer variants. Pre-training on ZINC250K (~250K molecules) using cross-modal contrastive and masked-atom objectives enables effective weight initialization at modest compute cost. We release all code, trained models, and data splits to support reproducibility.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示联邦学习中现有单维度客户端评估方法（仅关注模型性能）的局限性，提出基于夏普利值的多维度信任worthiness（可靠性、鲁棒性、公平性）贡献评估框架，证明单一指标无法全面评估客户端贡献，需建立综合评估机制以实现公平奖励分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习客户端评估方法过度依赖准确率等性能指标，忽视了模型可信度的多维特性（可靠性、对抗鲁棒性、公平性），导致评估体系存在片面性。

Method: 采用夏普利值近似方法量化客户端在三个可信度维度上的贡献：可靠性（噪声数据容忍能力）、鲁棒性（对抗样本抵抗能力）、公平性（人口统计均等性指标）。

Result: 实验表明不同可信度维度的贡献相互独立，无单一客户端在所有维度均表现优异，暴露当前单指标评估体系无法反映真实贡献差异。

Conclusion: 必须构建多维度综合评估体系才能实现公平的贡献度衡量与奖励分配，单一性能指标不足以支撑联邦学习生态的可持续发展。

Abstract: Federated learning offers a privacy-friendly collaborative learning framework, yet its success, like any joint venture, hinges on the contributions of its participants. Existing client evaluation methods predominantly focus on model performance, such as accuracy or loss, which represents only one dimension of a machine learning model's overall utility. In contrast, this work investigates the critical, yet overlooked, issue of client contributions towards a model's trustworthiness -- specifically, its reliability (tolerance to noisy data), resilience (resistance to adversarial examples), and fairness (measured via demographic parity). To quantify these multifaceted contributions, we employ the state-of-the-art approximation of the Shapley value, a principled method for value attribution. Our results reveal that no single client excels across all dimensions, which are largely independent from each other, highlighting a critical flaw in current evaluation scheme: no single metric is adequate for comprehensive evaluation and equitable rewarding allocation.

*Afshin Khadangi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes TRC², a novel decoder-only architecture for continual learning in language models that uses sparse thalamic routing and a fast corrective pathway to improve the stability-plasticity tradeoff while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard language model training and fine-tuning pipelines are brittle under non-stationary data, causing catastrophic forgetting during online updates. Existing stability-improving methods increase latency, memory footprint, or dense computation in ways that don't scale well to long contexts.

Method: Introduces TRC² (Thalamically Routed Cortical Columns), a decoder-only backbone combining sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with mechanisms for modulation, prediction, memory, and feedback, plus a fast corrective pathway for rapid adaptation without destabilizing slower parameters. The architecture is sparse and chunk-parallel.

Result: Across language modeling and continual learning benchmarks, TRC² improves the stability-plasticity tradeoff at comparable compute, enabling rapid on-stream adaptation while preserving previously acquired behavior.

Conclusion: TRC² provides an architectural-level solution for continual learning that balances stability and plasticity efficiently, making it suitable for deployed language models facing streaming domain shifts.

Abstract: Continual learning is a core requirement for deployed language models, yet standard training and fine-tuning pipelines remain brittle under non-stationary data. Online updates often induce catastrophic forgetting, while methods that improve stability frequently increase latency, memory footprint, or dense computation in ways that do not scale well to long contexts. We introduce TRC$^{2}$ (Thalamically Routed Cortical Columns), a decoder-only backbone that addresses continual learning at the architectural level. TRC$^{2}$ combines sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with mechanisms for modulation, prediction, memory, and feedback, together with a fast corrective pathway that supports rapid adaptation without destabilizing slower parameters. The resulting block is sparse and chunk-parallel, enabling efficient training and inference while preserving clean ablations of each subsystem. We instantiate a reproducible training and evaluation stack and a continual-learning harness that measures proxy forgetting under streaming domain shifts. Across language modeling and continual learning benchmarks, TRC$^{2}$ improves the stability-plasticity tradeoff at comparable compute, enabling rapid on-stream adaptation while preserving previously acquired behavior.

TL;DR: 针对RL训练的大语言模型难以有效蒸馏到小模型的问题，提出RL-aware蒸馏(RLAD)，其核心Trust Region Ratio蒸馏(TRRD)用PPO/GRPO风格的似然比目标替代KL散度，实现优势感知的信任域有界蒸馏，在逻辑推理和数学基准上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法针对监督微调设计，与RL结合时存在分布不匹配（教师监督与学生策略演化不一致）和目标干扰（KL正则化与奖励最大化冲突且需精细平衡），导致难以高效压缩RL训练后的大型推理模型。

Method: 提出RLAD框架，在RL过程中进行选择性模仿；核心TRRD组件以教师-旧策略混合为锚点，用PPO/GRPO式似然比目标替代KL正则化，实现优势感知、信任域有界的蒸馏，自然平衡探索、利用与模仿。

Result: 在多种逻辑推理和数学基准测试中，RLAD持续优于离线蒸馏、标准GRPO以及基于KL的on-policy教师-学生蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: RLAD通过TRRD解决了RL蒸馏中的分布不匹配与目标干扰问题，为将大型RL训练语言模型的推理能力高效迁移至小型模型提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has recently driven major gains in long chain-of-thought reasoning large language models (LLMs), but the high inference cost of such models motivates distillation into smaller students. Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), relying on fixed teacher traces or teacher-student Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization. When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation. Across diverse logic reasoning and math benchmarks, RLAD consistently outperforms offline distillation, standard GRPO, and KL-based on-policy teacher-student knowledge distillation.

### [83] [Space Syntax-guided Post-training for Residential Floor Plan Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22507)
*Zhuoyang Jiang,Dongqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A post-training method (SSPT) that injects space syntax knowledge into floor plan generation models via a non-differentiable oracle, improving public space dominance and functional hierarchy, with reinforcement learning (PPO) showing superior efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained floor plan generation models optimize for data distribution but under-emphasize critical architectural priors like public space dominance and connectivity, leading to suboptimal functional hierarchy in generated layouts.

Method: SSPT uses a non-differentiable oracle that converts RPLAN layouts into rectangle-space graphs via maximal-rectangle decomposition and door-mediated adjacency, then computes integration-based metrics for public space evaluation. Two strategies: (1) iterative retraining with space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, and (2) PPO reinforcement learning with space-syntax rewards.

Result: Both strategies significantly improve public-space dominance and functional hierarchy over baselines. PPO achieves stronger gains with higher computational efficiency and lower variance compared to iterative retraining.

Conclusion: SSPT offers a scalable, backbone-agnostic framework for integrating architectural theory into data-driven generation, enabling more principled floor plan design while maintaining compatibility with existing generative models.

Abstract: Pre-trained generative models for residential floor plans are typically optimized to fit large-scale data distributions, which can under-emphasize critical architectural priors such as the configurational dominance and connectivity of domestic public spaces (e.g., living rooms and foyers). This paper proposes Space Syntax-guided Post-training (SSPT), a post-training paradigm that explicitly injects space syntax knowledge into floor plan generation via a non-differentiable oracle. The oracle converts RPLAN-style layouts into rectangle-space graphs through greedy maximal-rectangle decomposition and door-mediated adjacency construction, and then computes integration-based measurements to quantify public space dominance and functional hierarchy.
  To enable consistent evaluation and diagnosis, we further introduce SSPT-Bench (Eval-8), an out-of-distribution benchmark that post-trains models using conditions capped at $\leq 7$ rooms while evaluating on 8-room programs, together with a unified metric suite for dominance, stability, and profile alignment. SSPT is instantiated with two strategies: (i) iterative retraining via space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, and (ii) reinforcement learning via PPO with space-syntax rewards. Experiments show that both strategies improve public-space dominance and restore clearer functional hierarchy compared to distribution-fitted baselines, while PPO achieves stronger gains with substantially higher compute efficiency and reduced variance. SSPT provides a scalable pathway for integrating architectural theory into data-driven plan generation and is compatible with other generative backbones given a post-hoc evaluation oracle.

Motivation: 现代深度预测模型仅优化点式预测损失，未利用滚动预测产生的丰富残差信息（如持续偏差、未建模模式等），造成信息浪费

Method: 提出TEFL（时序误差反馈学习）统一框架，通过低秩适配器集成历史残差，设计两阶段训练流程，解决部分可观测性、效率与过拟合、联合优化三大挑战

Conclusion: TEFL为深度预测系统提供了一种简单、通用且有效的增强方法，通过直接嵌入残差反馈机制提升模型性能与鲁棒性

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as transportation, energy, and meteorology. Despite their success, modern deep forecasting models are typically trained to minimize point-wise prediction loss without leveraging the rich information contained in past prediction residuals from rolling forecasts - residuals that reflect persistent biases, unmodeled patterns, or evolving dynamics. We propose TEFL (Temporal Error Feedback Learning), a unified learning framework that explicitly incorporates these historical residuals into the forecasting pipeline during both training and evaluation. To make this practical in deep multi-step settings, we address three key challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under the partial observability of rolling forecasts, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter to preserve efficiency and prevent overfitting, and (3) designing a two-stage training procedure that jointly optimizes the base forecaster and error module. Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show that TEFL consistently improves accuracy, reducing MAE by 5-10% on average. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness under abrupt changes and distribution shifts, with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios. By embedding residual-based feedback directly into the learning process, TEFL offers a simple, general, and effective enhancement to modern deep forecasting systems.

Motivation: 职业网球中发球（尤其一发）是战略核心，需平衡胜率最大化与不可预测性，而接发球方需预判方向；理解这一心理博弈对分析比赛决策机制至关重要

Method: 采用特征工程方法开发机器学习模型，聚焦职业选手一发方向预测，通过数据建模分析发球决策规律

Result: 模型对男性选手预测平均准确率约49%，女性约44%；证据表明顶尖选手采用混合策略（类似博弈论）决策，且疲劳因素影响发球方向选择

Conclusion: 发球决策存在可预测性但受多重因素制约；情境信息对回球方预判的作用可能比既往认知更重要，为运动决策分析提供新视角

Abstract: Serves, especially first serves, are very important in professional tennis. Servers choose their serve directions strategically to maximize their winning chances while trying to be unpredictable. On the other hand, returners try to predict serve directions to make good returns. The mind game between servers and returners is an important part of decision-making in professional tennis matches. To help understand the players' serve decisions, we have developed a machine learning method for predicting professional tennis players' first serve directions. Through feature engineering, our method achieves an average prediction accuracy of around 49\% for male players and 44\% for female players. Our analysis provides some evidence that top professional players use a mixed-strategy model in serving decisions and that fatigue might be a factor in choosing serve directions. Our analysis also suggests that contextual information is perhaps more important for returners' anticipatory reactions than previously thought.

Conclusion: pNMF提供了一个跨越尺度的非平凡解路径，能够有效地学习多尺度数据表示。

Abstract: Matrix factorization techniques, especially Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), have been widely used for dimensionality reduction and interpretable data representation. However, existing NMF-based methods are inherently single-scale and fail to capture the evolution of connectivity structures across resolutions. In this work, we propose persistent nonnegative matrix factorization (pNMF), a scale-parameterized family of NMF problems, that produces a sequence of persistence-aligned embeddings rather than a single one. By leveraging persistent homology, we identify a canonical minimal sufficient scale set at which the underlying connectivity undergoes qualitative changes. These canonical scales induce a sequence of graph Laplacians, leading to a coupled NMF formulation with scale-wise geometric regularization and explicit cross-scale consistency constraint. We analyze the structural properties of the embeddings along the scale parameter and establish bounds on their increments between consecutive scales. The resulting model defines a nontrivial solution path across scales, rather than a single factorization, which poses new computational challenges. We develop a sequential alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Numerical experiments on synthetic and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in multi-scale low-rank embeddings.

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific machine learning (SciML) has accelerated discovery across diverse domains, yet designing effective SciML models remains a challenging task. In practice, building such models often requires substantial prior knowledge and manual expertise, particularly in determining which input features to use and how large the model should be. We introduce LUMOS, an end-to-end framework based on L0-regularized learning that unifies feature selection and model pruning to democratize SciML model design. By employing semi-stochastic gating and reparameterization techniques, LUMOS dynamically selects informative features and prunes redundant parameters during training, reducing the reliance on manual tuning while maintaining predictive accuracy.

TL;DR: RAIN-Merging通过将指令微调模型集成到大型推理模型中，利用零空间投影和指令注意力机制解决格式不匹配问题，在保持推理能力的同时显著提升指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型(LRMs)擅长长链推理但常不遵循输出格式要求，而指令微调模型(ITMs)虽擅长指令遵循，但两者因输出格式差异（LRMs有显式思考/响应分段，ITMs仅输出答案）导致直接合并效果不佳且脆弱。

Method: 提出RAIN-Merging两步梯度无关方法：1)用推理校准集将ITM任务向量投影到思考特殊token前向特征的零空间，保留LRM结构化推理；2)用指令校准集通过指令注意力估计模块特定缩放因子，放大指令相关组件并抑制泄露。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过精心设计模型融合策略，可同时获得强大推理能力和精确指令遵循能力，为构建更可靠的AI系统提供有效方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at a long chain of reasoning but often fail to faithfully follow instructions regarding output format, constraints, or specific requirements. We investigate whether this gap can be closed by integrating an instruction-tuned model (ITM) into an LRM. Analyzing their differences in parameter space, namely task vectors, we find that their principal subspaces are nearly orthogonal across key modules, suggesting a lightweight merging with minimal interference. However, we also demonstrate that naive merges are fragile because they overlook the output format mismatch between LRMs (with explicit thinking and response segments) and ITMs (answers-only). We introduce RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging), a gradient-free method that integrates instruction following while preserving thinking format and reasoning performance. First, with a small reasoning calibration set, we project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens, which preserves the LRM's structured reasoning mechanisms. Second, using a small instruction calibration set, we estimate instruction attention to derive module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage. Across four instruction-following benchmarks and nine reasoning & general capability benchmarks, RAIN-Merging substantially improves instruction adherence while maintaining reasoning quality. The gains are consistent across model scales and architectures, translating to improved performance in agent settings.

*Zhikai Chen,Han Xie,Jian Zhang,Jiliang Tang,Xiang Song,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comprehensive study comparing Relational Deep Learning (RDL) and Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) for relational databases reveals neither consistently dominates, leading to Relatron, a meta-selector that chooses between them based on task signals, achieving up to 18.5% improvement with 10x lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive modeling over relational databases is challenging due to cross-table dependencies and feature interactions; while RDL and DFS show performance gains, their comparative advantages and architecture selection principles remain poorly understood.

Method: Unified RDL and DFS in a shared design space, conducted architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks, created a model performance bank, analyzed performance gap drivers using task homophily and affinity embedding signals, and built a meta-selector with lightweight loss-landscape metrics.

Result: Three key findings: (1) RDL doesn't consistently outperform DFS; (2) no single architecture dominates across tasks; (3) validation accuracy is unreliable for architecture selection. Relatron resolves performance degradation from excessive tuning and achieves significant improvements.

Conclusion: Task-aware model selection using task embedding signals and loss-landscape metrics is crucial for optimal performance on relational databases, outperforming brute-force tuning with much lower computational cost.

Abstract: Predictive modeling over relational databases (RDBs) powers applications, yet remains challenging due to capturing both cross-table dependencies and complex feature interactions. Relational Deep Learning (RDL) methods automate feature engineering via message passing, while classical approaches like Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) rely on predefined non-parametric aggregators. Despite performance gains, the comparative advantages of RDL over DFS and the design principles for selecting effective architectures remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that unifies RDL and DFS in a shared design space and conducts architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) RDL does not consistently outperform DFS, with performance being highly task-dependent; (2) no single architecture dominates across tasks, underscoring the need for task-aware model selection; and (3) validation accuracy is an unreliable guide for architecture choice. This search yields a model performance bank that links architecture configurations to their performance; leveraging this bank, we analyze the drivers of the RDL-DFS performance gap and introduce two task signals -- RDB task homophily and an affinity embedding that captures size, path, feature, and temporal structure -- whose correlation with the gap enables principled routing. Guided by these signals, we propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that chooses between RDL and DFS and prunes the within-family search. Lightweight loss-landscape metrics further guard against brittle checkpoints by preferring flatter optima. In experiments, Relatron resolves the "more tuning, worse performance" effect and, in joint hyperparameter-architecture optimization, achieves up to 18.5% improvement over strong baselines with 10x lower cost than Fisher information-based alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have significant safety disparities across languages where low-resource languages can bypass safety guardrails more easily than English. Current solutions like multilingual SFT and RLHF are too expensive and require scarce multilingual safety data.

Method: They propose a training-free alignment framework using Sparse Weight Editing. They identify that safety capabilities reside in sparse neurons, formulate cross-lingual alignment as a constrained linear transformation, and derive a closed-form solution to map harmful LRL representations to robust HRL safety subspaces while preserving utility via null-space projection.

Result: Experiments across 8 languages and models (Llama-3, Qwen-2.5) show the method substantially reduces Attack Success Rate in low-resource languages with negligible impact on general reasoning capabilities, using a single, data-efficient calculation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses cross-lingual safety disparities efficiently without training, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM safety across languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant safety disparities across languages, with low-resource languages (LRLs) often bypassing safety guardrails established for high-resource languages (HRLs) like English. Existing solutions, such as multilingual supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are computationally expensive and dependent on scarce multilingual safety data. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free alignment framework based on Sparse Weight Editing. Identifying that safety capabilities are localized within a sparse set of safety neurons, we formulate the cross-lingual alignment problem as a constrained linear transformation. We derive a closed-form solution to optimally map the harmful representations of LRLs to the robust safety subspaces of HRLs, while preserving general utility via a null-space projection constraint. Extensive experiments across 8 languages and multiple model families (Llama-3, Qwen-2.5) demonstrate that our method substantially reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) in LRLs with negligible impact on general reasoning capabilities, all achieved with a single, data-efficient calculation.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have become a popular medium for decoding visual information due to their cost-effectiveness and high temporal resolution. However, current approaches face significant challenges in bridging the modality gap between EEG and image data. These methods typically rely on complex adaptation processes involving multiple stages, making it hard to maintain consistency and manage compounding errors. Furthermore, the computational overhead imposed by large-scale diffusion models limit their practicality in real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this work, we present AVDE, a lightweight and efficient framework for visual decoding from EEG signals. First, we leverage LaBraM, a pre-trained EEG model, and fine-tune it via contrastive learning to align EEG and image representations. Second, we adopt an autoregressive generative framework based on a "next-scale prediction" strategy: images are encoded into multi-scale token maps using a pre-trained VQ-VAE, and a transformer is trained to autoregressively predict finer-scale tokens starting from EEG embeddings as the coarsest representation. This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images. Experiments on two datasets show that AVDE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, while using only 10% of the parameters. In addition, visualization of intermediate outputs shows that the generative process of AVDE reflects the hierarchical nature of human visual perception. These results highlight the potential of autoregressive models as efficient and interpretable tools for practical BCI applications.

Motivation: Large reasoning models waste computation by overthinking simple queries, and existing methods suffer from unstable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and poor robustness to heterogeneous reasoning behaviors.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Hybrid Fine-Tuning to expose models to thinking/no-thinking behaviors for proper initialization; 2) Adaptive RL with Correctness-Preserving Advantage Shaping (CPAS) to protect correct long reasoning chains, and Length-Aware Gradient Regulation (LAGR) to stabilize optimization under reasoning-length heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The framework enables stable adaptive thinking in LRMs, significantly improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance through extended reasoning traces, but they often exhibit overthinking behavior for low-complexity queries. Existing efforts to mitigate this issue are fundamentally limited by unstable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and poor robustness to heterogeneous reasoning behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework for stable adaptive thinking in LRMs. The framework first applies Hybrid Fine-Tuning to expose the model to both thinking and no-thinking behaviors, establishing well-conditioned initialization. It then performs adaptive reinforcement learning with Correctness-Preserving Advantage Shaping (CPAS) to avoid suppressing correct long-chain reasoning, and Length-Aware Gradient Regulation (LAGR) to stabilize optimization under severe reasoning-length heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-1.5B and 7B show consistent improvements over strong baselines, achieving up to +3.7/+3.6 accuracy points while reducing generated tokens by 40.6%/43.9%. Further analyses across varying problem difficulties and out-of-distribution tasks confirm the robustness and generalization of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A post-hoc threshold optimization framework that balances safety, efficiency, and fairness under strict capacity constraints with a single global threshold, proving capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities while maintaining high risk identification where unconstrained methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning in high-stakes domains requires balancing predictive safety and algorithmic fairness, but existing interventions assume unlimited resources and violate anti-discrimination laws through group-specific thresholds.

Method: Model-agnostic post-hoc framework with parameterized ethical loss function and bounded decision rule that enforces a single global threshold for legal compliance, analytically proving threshold properties.

Result: Capacity constraints determine the final threshold in over 80% of configurations; under 25% capacity limit, maintains recall of 0.409-0.702 while standard fairness methods collapse to near-zero utility.

Conclusion: Theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits in deployment; the framework provides a practical, legally compliant mechanism for navigating ethical trade-offs by decoupling scoring from policy evaluation.

Abstract: The deployment of machine learning in high-stakes domains requires a balance between predictive safety and algorithmic fairness. However, existing fairness interventions often as- sume unconstrained resources and employ group-specific decision thresholds that violate anti- discrimination regulations. We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment. By decou- pling predictive scoring from policy evaluation and strictly bounding intervention rates, this framework provides a practical and legally compliant mechanism for stakeholders to navigate unavoidable ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments.

Result: 在128K上下文的Llama-3.1-8B上，S2O在相同稀疏度下单算子MSE降低3.82倍，在相同MSE下预填充计算密度降低3.31倍，保持端到端准确率的同时，实现注意力层7.51倍和端到端3.81倍加速。

Conclusion: S2O通过重要性引导的在线重排与早停规则，显著提升了实用稀疏度上限，在受控误差预算下大幅减少计算量，为长上下文大模型推理提供了高效的稀疏注意力解决方案。

Abstract: Attention scales quadratically with sequence length, fundamentally limiting long-context inference. Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.
  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling. On Llama-3.1-8B under a 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82$\times$ at matched sparsity, and reduces prefill compute density by 3.31$\times$ at matched MSE; meanwhile, it preserves end-to-end accuracy and achieves 7.51$\times$ attention and 3.81$\times$ end-to-end speedups.

Abstract: Circuit discovery has recently attracted attention as a potential research direction to explain the non-trivial behaviors of language models. It aims to find the computational subgraphs, also known as circuits, within the model that are responsible for solving specific tasks. However, most existing studies overlook the holistic nature of these circuits and require designing specific corrupted activations for different tasks, which is inaccurate and inefficient. In this work, we propose an end-to-end approach based on the principle of Information Bottleneck, called IBCircuit, to identify informative circuits holistically. IBCircuit is an optimization framework for holistic circuit discovery and can be applied to any given task without tediously corrupted activation design. In both the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) and Greater-Than tasks, IBCircuit identifies more faithful and minimal circuits in terms of critical node components and edge components compared to recent related work.

*Donghong Cai,Jiarui Feng,Yanbo Wang,Da Zheng,Yixin Chen,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes TabDLM, a unified diffusion model that jointly generates heterogeneous tabular data with both free-form text and structured numerical/categorical features, addressing limitations of existing diffusion and LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain both structured attributes and free-form text fields, but existing generation methods struggle: diffusion models degrade text quality while LLMs distort numerical precision, creating a need for a unified approach.

Method: TabDLM uses a joint numerical-language diffusion model based on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). It applies masked diffusion to text/categorical features and continuous diffusion to numerical features via learned numeric token embeddings, with bidirectional attention capturing cross-modality interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show TabDLM outperforms strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines in generating heterogeneous tabular data.

Conclusion: TabDLM provides an effective unified framework for generating realistic synthetic tabular data with mixed modalities, overcoming the trade-offs between text quality and numerical precision in existing methods.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has attracted growing attention due to its importance for data augmentation, foundation models, and privacy. However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields (e.g., reviews or clinical notes) alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TabDLM compared to strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines.

Motivation: 现有超低位宽（亚2-bit）量化训练方法因"参数民主化效应"导致所有参数敏感度同质化，限制模型表达能力，无法达到理想的准确性和可扩展性。

Method: pQuant将线性层拆分为两个专业分支：占主导的1-bit分支用于高效计算，紧凑的高精度分支专门保留最敏感参数。通过定制的特征缩放引导模型将敏感参数分配到高精度分支，并将该分支扩展为多个稀疏激活的专家以实现高效容量扩展。

Result: 大量实验表明pQuant在超低位宽量化中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过解决参数民主化瓶颈，pQuant成功构建了更高效、更准确的量化LLM，适用于边缘部署。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training from scratch has emerged as a promising approach for building efficient large language models (LLMs) with extremely low-bit weights (sub 2-bit), which can offer substantial advantages for edge deployment. However, existing methods still fail to achieve satisfactory accuracy and scalability. In this work, we identify a parameter democratization effect as a key bottleneck: the sensitivity of all parameters becomes homogenized, severely limiting expressivity. To address this, we propose pQuant, a method that decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch dedicated to preserving the most sensitive parameters. Through tailored feature scaling, we explicitly guide the model to allocate sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch. Furthermore, we extend this branch into multiple, sparsely-activated experts, enabling efficient capacity scaling. Extensive experiments indicate our pQuant achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出"算法核心"概念，揭示不同训练的大模型在权重不同的情况下，内部学习到的是相同且紧凑的低维计算子空间，这些不变量才是模型计算的本质，而非权重细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型能力强大但其内部工作原理不明。训练选择的是行为而非电路结构，导致同一功能对应多种权重配置。如何区分反映计算的内部结构与训练偶然产物，是理解模型的关键挑战。

Method: 提出提取"算法核心"——任务性能必需且充分的紧凑子空间。通过分析独立训练的transformer、马尔可夫链模型、模加模型和GPT-2，研究其在不同训练过程和规模下的内部结构不变性。

Result: 发现独立训练的模型权重不同但收敛到相同核心；马尔可夫链模型将3D核心嵌入正交子空间却保持相同转移谱；模加模型在grokking时发现紧凑循环算子并膨胀，可预测记忆到泛化的转变；GPT-2的主谓一致由单一轴控制，翻转该轴会全局反转语法数。

Conclusion: Transformer计算围绕紧凑、共享的算法结构组织，存在跨训练和规模的低维不变量。 mechanistic interpretability应聚焦这些计算本质而非实现细节。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit sophisticated capabilities, yet understanding how they work internally remains a central challenge. A fundamental obstacle is that training selects for behavior, not circuitry, so many weight configurations can implement the same function. Which internal structures reflect the computation, and which are accidents of a particular training run? This work extracts algorithmic cores: compact subspaces necessary and sufficient for task performance. Independently trained transformers learn different weights but converge to the same cores. Markov-chain transformers embed 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces yet recover identical transition spectra. Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, yielding a predictive model of the memorization-to-generalization transition. GPT-2 language models govern subject-verb agreement through a single axis that, when flipped, inverts grammatical number throughout generation across scales. These results reveal low-dimensional invariants that persist across training runs and scales, suggesting that transformer computations are organized around compact, shared algorithmic structures. Mechanistic interpretability could benefit from targeting such invariants -- the computational essence -- rather than implementation-specific details.

Abstract: Fairness in Continual Learning for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is an emerging yet underexplored challenge, particularly in the presence of imbalanced data distributions that can lead to biased model updates and suboptimal performance across tasks. While recent continual learning studies have made progress in addressing catastrophic forgetting, the problem of fairness caused the imbalanced data remains largely underexplored. This paper presents a novel Fairness Direct Preference Optimization (FaiDPO or $φ$-DPO) framework for continual learning in LMMs. In particular, we first propose a new continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by aligning learning with pairwise preference signals. Then, we identify the limitations of conventional DPO in imbalanced data and present a new $φ$-DPO loss that explicitly addresses distributional biases. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach addresses both forgetting and data imbalance. Additionally, to enable $φ$-DPO-based continual learning, we construct pairwise preference annotations for existing benchmarks in the context of continual learning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show the proposed $φ$-DPO achieves State-of-the-Art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior continual learning methods of LMMs.

Conclusion: 敏感性感知条件机制可在不牺牲非私有训练表达力的前提下，有效改善隐私保护的条件扩散模型训练效用，为差分隐私时序生成提供实用解决方案

Abstract: Condition injection enables diffusion models to generate context-aware outputs, which is essential for many time-series tasks. However, heterogeneous conditional contexts (e.g., observed history, missingness patterns or outlier covariates) can induce heavy-tailed per-example gradients. Under Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), these rare conditioning-driven heavy-tailed gradients disproportionately trigger global clipping, resulting in outlier-dominated updates, larger clipping bias, and degraded utility under a fixed privacy budget. In this paper, we propose DP-aware AdaLN-Zero, a drop-in sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism for conditional diffusion transformers that limits conditioning-induced gain without modifying the DP-SGD mechanism. DP-aware AdaLN-Zero jointly constrains conditioning representation magnitude and AdaLN modulation parameters via bounded re-parameterization, suppressing extreme gradient tail events before gradient clipping and noise injection. Empirically, DP-SGD equipped with DP-aware AdaLN-Zero improves interpolation/imputation and forecasting under matched privacy settings. We observe consistent gains on a real-world power dataset and two public ETT benchmarks over vanilla DP-SGD. Moreover, gradient diagnostics attribute these improvements to conditioning-specific tail reshaping and reduced clipping distortion, while preserving expressiveness in non-private training. Overall, these results show that sensitivity-aware conditioning can substantially improve private conditional diffusion training without sacrificing standard performance.

*Jiayang Meng,Tao Huang,Chen Hou,Guolong Zheng,Hong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes LM-DP-SGD, a layer-wise differentially private training method that adaptively allocates privacy protection across neural network layers based on their Membership Inference Attack (MIA) vulnerability to improve privacy-utility trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP-SGD uses uniform noise for all layers, ignoring heterogeneous MIA risks across layers in Embedding-as-an-Interface settings where intermediate representations leak training data membership.

Method: LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on public data to estimate per-layer MIA risks via attack error rates, then reweights each layer's gradient contribution during private training under fixed noise magnitude.

Result: Experiments show LM-DP-SGD reduces peak IR-level MIA risk while maintaining model utility under the same privacy budget, achieving better privacy-utility trade-off.

Conclusion: The method provides theoretically guaranteed, layer-appropriate privacy protection that adapts to heterogeneous vulnerability, outperforming uniform DP-SGD in privacy preservation without sacrificing utility.

Abstract: In Embedding-as-an-Interface (EaaI) settings, pre-trained models are queried for Intermediate Representations (IRs). The distributional properties of IRs can leak training-set membership signals, enabling Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) whose strength varies across layers. Although Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) mitigates such leakage, existing implementations employ per-example gradient clipping and a uniform, layer-agnostic noise multiplier, ignoring heterogeneous layer-wise MIA vulnerability. This paper introduces Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD (LM-DP-SGD), which adaptively allocates privacy protection across layers in proportion to their MIA risk. Specifically, LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on a public shadow dataset, extracts per-layer IRs from its train/test splits, and fits layer-specific MIA adversaries, using their attack error rates as MIA-risk estimates. Leveraging the cross-dataset transferability of MIAs, these estimates are then used to reweight each layer's contribution to the globally clipped gradient during private training, providing layer-appropriate protection under a fixed noise magnitude. We further establish theoretical guarantees on both privacy and convergence of LM-DP-SGD. Extensive experiments show that, under the same privacy budget, LM-DP-SGD reduces the peak IR-level MIA risk while preserving utility, yielding a superior privacy-utility trade-off.

TL;DR: 该论文提出语义管预测（STP）任务，基于测地线假设约束语言模型的隐藏状态轨迹，实现在减少16倍训练数据的情况下保持基线准确率，违反了Chinchilla缩放定律的数据项约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律仅描述典型训练而非最优训练，缺乏对数据效率边界的挑战；需要突破缩放定律隐含的数据效率限制。

Method: 提出测地线假设（token序列在语义流形上沿测地线运动），设计语义管预测（STP）任务作为JEPA风格正则化器，约束隐藏状态轨迹保持在测地线 tubular 邻域内。

Result: 在NL-RX-SYNTH数据集上，STP使LLM仅用1/16训练数据即可达到基线准确率，直接违反Chinchilla缩放定律的数据项约束。

Conclusion: 原则性几何先验可超越暴力缩放策略，STP通过提升信噪比和防止推理时轨迹碰撞来保持多样性，为数据高效训练提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) obey consistent scaling laws -- empirical power-law fits that predict how loss decreases with compute, data, and parameters. While predictive, these laws are descriptive rather than prescriptive: they characterize typical training, not optimal training. Surprisingly few works have successfully challenged the data-efficiency bounds implied by these laws -- which is our primary focus. To that end, we introduce the Geodesic Hypothesis, positing that token sequences trace geodesics on a smooth semantic manifold and are therefore locally linear. Building on this principle, we propose a novel Semantic Tube Prediction (STP) task, a JEPA-style regularizer that confines hidden-state trajectories to a tubular neighborhood of the geodesic. STP generalizes JEPA to language without requiring explicit multi-view augmentations. We show this constraint improves signal-to-noise ratio, and consequently preserves diversity by preventing trajectory collisions during inference. Empirically, STP allows LLMs to match baseline accuracy with 16$\times$ less training data on the NL-RX-SYNTH dataset, directly violating the data term of Chinchilla-style scaling laws and demonstrating that principled geometric priors can surpass brute-force scaling.

Motivation: 针对强化学习验证推理(RLVR)中的两个关键瓶颈：可识别性(identifiability)和可达性(reachability)，现有方法缺乏细粒度过程验证和从失败尝试中恢复的能力。

Method: 1) 可识别性增强：为奖励模型提供完整参考解作为上下文，实现细粒度过程验证以过滤错误阳性样本；2) 可达性提升：引入多轮采样策略，奖励模型为失败尝试生成错误报告，指导策略从全负样本组中"恢复"正确答案。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对提升奖励模型准确性具有巨大潜力，研究揭示了奖励黑客的普遍存在，为未来RLVR研究提供重要洞察。

Abstract: We propose ContextRL, a novel framework that leverages context augmentation to overcome these bottlenecks. Specifically, to enhance Identifiability, we provide the reward model with full reference solutions as context, enabling fine-grained process verification to filter out false positives (samples with the right answer but low-quality reasoning process). To improve Reachability, we introduce a multi-turn sampling strategy where the reward model generates mistake reports for failed attempts, guiding the policy to "recover" correct responses from previously all-negative groups. Experimental results on 11 perception and reasoning benchmarks show that ContextRL significantly improves knowledge discovery efficiency. Notably, ContextRL enables the Qwen3-VL-8B model to achieve performance comparable to the 32B model, outperforming standard RLVR baselines by a large margin while effectively mitigating reward hacking. Our in-depth analysis reveals the significant potential of contextual information for improving reward model accuracy and document the widespread occurrence of reward hacking, offering valuable insights for future RLVR research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses privacy heterogeneity in differentially private federated learning by proposing the first privacy-aware client selection strategy that adaptively optimizes selection probabilities based on varying privacy budgets, achieving up to 10% accuracy improvement on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP-FL methods assume uniform privacy budgets, but real-world scenarios have heterogeneous privacy requirements. Conventional client selection based on data quantity cannot distinguish between high-quality updates and those with substantial noise from strict privacy constraints, leading to suboptimal model performance.

Method: Establishes theoretical convergence analysis quantifying privacy heterogeneity's impact on training error, then formulates privacy-aware client selection as a convex optimization problem that adaptively adjusts selection probabilities to minimize training error.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the approach achieves up to 10% improvement in test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to existing baselines under heterogeneous privacy budgets.

Conclusion: Incorporating privacy heterogeneity into client selection is crucial for practical and effective federated learning, as demonstrated by the significant performance improvements over conventional methods.

Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) enables clients to collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving the privacy of their local data. However, most existing DP-FL approaches assume that all clients share a uniform privacy budget, an assumption that does not hold in real-world scenarios where privacy requirements vary widely. This privacy heterogeneity poses a significant challenge: conventional client selection strategies, which typically rely on data quantity, cannot distinguish between clients providing high-quality updates and those introducing substantial noise due to strict privacy constraints. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of privacy-aware client selection in DP-FL. We establish a theoretical foundation by deriving a convergence analysis that quantifies the impact of privacy heterogeneity on training error. Building on this analysis, we propose a privacy-aware client selection strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem, that adaptively adjusts selection probabilities to minimize training error. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 10% improvement in test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to existing baselines under heterogeneous privacy budgets. These results highlight the importance of incorporating privacy heterogeneity into client selection for practical and effective federated learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CEEH is a difficulty-aware reinforcement learning approach that selectively compresses reasoning for easy questions while maintaining exploration for hard ones, avoiding entropy collapse and reducing response length without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought reasoning is computationally expensive due to verbose steps. Existing compression methods cause entropy collapse by prematurely shrinking exploration space, especially harming performance on challenging questions that require extensive deduction.

Method: CEEH dynamically assesses question difficulty to apply selective entropy regularization—preserving diverse search space for hard questions while allowing aggressive compression for easy ones. It also introduces a dynamic optimal-length penalty based on historically shortest correct responses to counteract length inflation.

Result: Across six reasoning benchmarks, CEEH consistently reduces response length while maintaining accuracy comparable to the base model, and improves Pass@k performance relative to length-only optimization methods.

Conclusion: The difficulty-aware approach successfully addresses the entropy collapse problem in CoT compression, achieving computational efficiency without sacrificing reasoning capability, particularly on challenging tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has substantially empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning tasks, yet the verbose nature of explicit reasoning steps incurs prohibitive inference latency and computational costs, limiting real-world deployment. While existing compression methods - ranging from self-training to Reinforcement Learning (RL) with length constraints - attempt to mitigate this, they often sacrifice reasoning capability for brevity. We identify a critical failure mode in these approaches: explicitly optimizing for shorter trajectories triggers rapid entropy collapse, which prematurely shrinks the exploration space and stifles the discovery of valid reasoning paths, particularly for challenging questions requiring extensive deduction. To address this issue, we propose Compress responses for Easy questions and Explore Hard ones (CEEH), a difficulty-aware approach to RL-based efficient reasoning. CEEH dynamically assesses instance difficulty to apply selective entropy regularization: it preserves a diverse search space for currently hard questions to ensure robustness, while permitting aggressive compression on easier instances where the reasoning path is well-established. In addition, we introduce a dynamic optimal-length penalty anchored to the historically shortest correct response, which effectively counteracts entropy-induced length inflation and stabilizes the reward signal. Across six reasoning benchmarks, CEEH consistently reduces response length while maintaining accuracy comparable to the base model, and improves Pass@k relative to length-only optimization.

Abstract: Universal graph pre-training has emerged as a key paradigm in graph representation learning, offering a promising way to train encoders to learn transferable representations from unlabeled graphs and to effectively generalize across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, recent explorations in universal graph pre-training primarily focus on homogeneous graphs and it remains unexplored for heterogeneous graphs, which exhibit greater structural and semantic complexity. This heterogeneity makes it highly challenging to train a universal encoder for diverse heterogeneous graphs: (i) the diverse types with dataset-specific semantics hinder the construction of a unified representation space; (ii) the number and semantics of meta-paths vary across datasets, making encoding and aggregation patterns learned from one dataset difficult to apply to others. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Meta-path-aware Universal heterogeneous Graph pre-training (MUG) approach. Specifically, for challenge (i), MUG introduces a input unification module that integrates information from multiple node and relation types within each heterogeneous graph into a unified representation.This representation is then projected into a shared space by a dimension-aware encoder, enabling alignment across graphs with diverse schemas.Furthermore, for challenge (ii), MUG trains a shared encoder to capture consistent structural patterns across diverse meta-path views rather than relying on dataset-specific aggregation strategies, while a global objective encourages discriminability and reduces dataset-specific biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MUG on some real datasets.

Conclusion: LEDA通过潜在语义分布对齐有效解决了通用图预训练的核心挑战，为跨领域图表示学习提供了新方案，尤其在数据稀缺场景下展现出强大优势

Abstract: Recent advances in generic large models, such as GPT and DeepSeek, have motivated the introduction of universality to graph pre-training, aiming to learn rich and generalizable knowledge across diverse domains using graph representations to improve performance in various downstream applications. However, most existing methods face challenges in learning effective knowledge from generic graphs, primarily due to simplistic data alignment and limited training guidance. The issue of simplistic data alignment arises from the use of a straightforward unification for highly diverse graph data, which fails to align semantics and misleads pre-training models. The problem with limited training guidance lies in the arbitrary application of in-domain pre-training paradigms to cross-domain scenarios. While it is effective in enhancing discriminative representation in one data space, it struggles to capture effective knowledge from many graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Latent sEmantic Distribution Alignment (LEDA) model for universal graph pre-training. Specifically, we first introduce a dimension projection unit to adaptively align diverse domain features into a shared semantic space with minimal information loss. Furthermore, we design a variational semantic inference module to obtain the shared latent distribution. The distribution is then adopted to guide the domain projection, aligning it with shared semantics across domains and ensuring cross-domain semantic learning. LEDA exhibits strong performance across a broad range of graphs and downstream tasks. Remarkably, in few-shot cross-domain settings, it significantly outperforms in-domain baselines and advanced universal pre-training models.

### [108] [Switch-Hurdle: A MoE Encoder with AR Hurdle Decoder for Intermittent Demand Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22685)
*Fabian Muşat,Simona Căbuz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Switch-Hurdle: A novel Mixture-of-Experts encoder with Hurdle-based decoder that separates intermittent demand forecasting into sale occurrence (binary classification) and quantity prediction (conditional regression) for improved accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intermittent demand patterns (long zero sequences with sporadic sales) challenge both traditional methods (ARIMA, exponential smoothing) and modern neural networks, which either treat demand as continuous or become computationally expensive when scaled across many sparse series.

Method: The Switch-Hurdle framework integrates a sparse Top-1 MoE encoder (with straight-through estimator for dense backward pass) and a cross-attention autoregressive decoder with a shared hurdle head that explicitly models both sale probability (binary classification) and sale quantity (conditional regression).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance on the M5 benchmark and a large proprietary retail dataset while maintaining computational scalability across many sparse time series.

Conclusion: Structured separation of occurrence and magnitude processes via Switch-Hurdle effectively addresses intermittent demand forecasting limitations, delivering superior performance and scalability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Intermittent demand, a pattern characterized by long sequences of zero sales punctuated by sporadic, non-zero values, poses a persistent challenge in retail and supply chain forecasting. Both traditional methods, such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, or Croston variants, as well as modern neural architectures such as DeepAR and Transformer-based models often underperform on such data, as they treat demand as a single continuous process or become computationally expensive when scaled across many sparse series. To address these limitations, we introduce Switch-Hurdle: a new framework that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) encoder with a Hurdle-based probabilistic decoder. The encoder uses a sparse Top-1 expert routing during the forward pass yet approximately dense in the backward pass via a straight-through estimator (STE). The decoder follows a cross-attention autoregressive design with a shared hurdle head that explicitly separates the forecasting task into two components: a binary classification component estimating the probability of a sale, and a conditional regression component, predicting the quantity given a sale. This structured separation enables the model to capture both occurrence and magnitude processes inherent to intermittent demand. Empirical results on the M5 benchmark and a large proprietary retail dataset show that Switch-Hurdle achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance while maintaining scalability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with geometric reasoning due to their limited perception of fundamental diagram elements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce GeoPerceive, a benchmark comprising diagram instances paired with domain-specific language (DSL) representations, along with an efficient automatic data generation pipeline. This design enables the isolated evaluation of geometric perception independently from reasoning. To exploit the data provided by GeoPerceive for enhancing the geometric perception capabilities of VLMs, we propose GeoDPO, a translator-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework. GeoDPO employs an NL-to-DSL translator, which is trained on synthetic pairs generated by the data engine of GeoPerceive, to bridge natural language and DSL. This translator facilitates the computation of fine-grained, DSL-level scores, which serve as reward signals in reinforcement learning. We assess GeoDPO on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, spanning tasks in geometric perception as well as downstream reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers only marginal improvements and may even impair performance in out-of-domain scenarios, GeoDPO achieves substantial gains: $+26.5\%$ on in-domain data, $+8.0\%$ on out-of-domain data, and $+39.0\%$ on downstream reasoning tasks. These findings underscore the superior performance and generalization ability of GeoDPO over SFT. All codes are released at https://github.com/Longin-Yu/GeoPerceive

*Kaizheng Wang,Yunjia Wang,Fabio Cuzzolin,David Moens,Hans Hallez,Siu Lun Chau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper enables direct comparison between two seemingly incompatible uncertainty modeling approaches (distribution-based and set-based) by controlling for predictive model variations, revealing how representation choices impact real-world uncertainty-aware tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing second-order uncertainty representations (distribution-based vs. set-based/credal sets) are considered fundamentally incomparable due to differing semantics and evaluation practices, with no clear understanding of their relative practical merits when isolated from predictive model differences.

Method: Constructs both representations from identical finite predictive distributions generated by a shared neural network, then evaluates them using 3 uncertainty measures across 8 benchmarks (including selective prediction and OOD detection) spanning 6 predictive models with 10 runs per configuration.

Result: Demonstrates that meaningful, controlled comparison between these paradigms is feasible; reveals how specific representation choices (e.g., convex hulls vs. distributional summaries) directly influence practical performance in uncertainty-aware applications.

Conclusion: Contrary to prior assumptions, the frameworks are comparable when isolated from predictive model effects, providing actionable insights for selecting uncertainty representations based on task requirements.

Abstract: Epistemic uncertainty in neural networks is commonly modeled using two second-order paradigms: distribution-based representations, which rely on posterior parameter distributions, and set-based representations based on credal sets (convex sets of probability distributions). These frameworks are often regarded as fundamentally non-comparable due to differing semantics, assumptions, and evaluation practices, leaving their relative merits unclear. Empirical comparisons are further confounded by variations in the underlying predictive models. To clarify this issue, we present a controlled comparative study enabling principled, like-for-like evaluation of the two paradigms. Both representations are constructed from the same finite collection of predictive distributions generated by a shared neural network, isolating representational effects from predictive accuracy. Our study evaluates each representation through the lens of 3 uncertainty measures across 8 benchmarks, including selective prediction and out-of-distribution detection, spanning 6 underlying predictive models and 10 independent runs per configuration. Our results show that meaningful comparison between these seemingly non-comparable frameworks is both feasible and informative, providing insights into how second-order representation choices impact practical uncertainty-aware performance.

Conclusion: KMLP establishes a scalable deep learning paradigm for large-scale web tabular data, effectively addressing key challenges while automating feature engineering and demonstrating superior scalability.

Abstract: Predictive modeling on web-scale tabular data with billions of instances and hundreds of heterogeneous numerical features faces significant scalability challenges. These features exhibit anisotropy, heavy-tailed distributions, and non-stationarity, creating bottlenecks for models like Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and requiring laborious manual feature engineering. We introduce KMLP, a hybrid deep architecture integrating a shallow Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) front-end with a Gated Multilayer Perceptron (gMLP) backbone. The KAN front-end uses learnable activation functions to automatically model complex non-linear transformations for each feature, while the gMLP backbone captures high-order interactions. Experiments on public benchmarks and an industrial dataset with billions of samples show KMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with advantages over baselines like GBDTs increasing at larger scales, validating KMLP as a scalable deep learning paradigm for large-scale web tabular data.

Abstract: In this work, we present the first theoretical analysis of multi-agent imitation learning (MAIL) in linear Markov games where both the transition dynamics and each agent's reward function are linear in some given features. We demonstrate that by leveraging this structure, it is possible to replace the state-action level "all policy deviation concentrability coefficient" (Freihaut et al., arXiv:2510.09325) with a concentrability coefficient defined at the feature level which can be much smaller than the state-action analog when the features are informative about states' similarity. Furthermore, to circumvent the need for any concentrability coefficient, we turn to the interactive setting. We provide the first, computationally efficient, interactive MAIL algorithm for linear Markov games and show that its sample complexity depends only on the dimension of the feature map $d$. Building on these theoretical findings, we propose a deep MAIL interactive algorithm which clearly outperforms BC on games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4.

Method: 提出分布式提示缓存机制，利用设备间的提示相似性共享中间状态；为减少通信开销，采用基于布隆过滤器的目录结构判断远程服务器是否拥有所需状态，从而避免不必要的数据传输。

Result: 在树莓派 Zero 2W 平台上使用 Gemma-3 270M 模型和 MMLU 数据集进行实验，平均 TTFT 降低 93.12%，TTLT 降低 50.07%。

Conclusion: 分布式提示缓存结合布隆过滤器目录能够有效提升边缘设备上 LLM 推理性能，显著降低首 token 和末 token 的延迟，为资源受限环境下的高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Since local LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices imposes a severe performance bottleneck, this paper proposes distributed prompt caching to enhance inference performance by cooperatively sharing intermediate processing states across multiple low-end edge devices. To fully utilize prompt similarity, our distributed caching mechanism also supports partial matching. As this approach introduces communication overhead associated with state sharing over a wireless network, we introduce a Bloom-filter-based data structure, referred to as a catalog, to determine whether a remote server possesses the desired internal states, thereby suppressing unnecessary communication. Experiments using the Gemma-3 270M model and the MMLU dataset on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W platform demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces TTFT (Time to First Token) and TTLT (Time to Last Token) by 93.12% and 50.07% on average, respectively.

Conclusion: HGPO有效解决了逐步优势估计中的上下文不一致问题，无需增加额外开销即可实现更优的偏差-方差平衡，为长时程智能体任务提供了更精细的策略优化方案。

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning (RL), such as GRPO, has advanced the capabilities of large language models on long-horizon agentic tasks. To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

TL;DR: 本文探究上下文线索如何影响大语言模型在电车难题类道德决策，发现模型极易被表面相关信号操纵，且推理能力有时会放大偏见而非减轻。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型道德基准使用无上下文提示并假设偏好稳定，但实际部署中提示包含可能操纵决策的上下文信号（如用户请求、社会规范暗示），亟需更全面的评估方法。

Method: 作者构建了定向上下文影响的试点评估框架，在电车难题类道德抉择任务中，对每个人口统计因素应用仅在偏好的群体上不同的匹配、方向翻转的上下文影响，系统测量模型的定向响应变化。

Result: 研究发现四方面：(i) 上下文影响即使表面相关也能显著改变决策；(ii) 基线偏好无法预测定向可操纵性，模型可能表现中立但呈现系统性不对称偏转；(iii) 影响可能适得其反——模型声称中立但选择仍会偏移，甚至朝相反方向；(iv) 推理虽降低平均敏感度，但会放大有偏见的少样本示例效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了当前道德评估的局限性，呼吁通过受控的方向翻转上下文操作扩展评估体系，以更准确地刻画模型行为和安全特性。

Abstract: Moral benchmarks for LLMs typically use context-free prompts, implicitly assuming stable preferences. In deployment, however, prompts routinely include contextual signals such as user requests, cues on social norms, etc. that may steer decisions. We study how directed contextual influences reshape decisions in trolley-problem-style moral triage settings. We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples. Our findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior.

Result: 模型能捕获保守甲基化模式并在多物种间稳健区分；泛化能力源于保守内在基序（如GC含量）而非物种亲缘关系；算法提取的基序可靠性显著高于前人研究；发现GAGG核心基序与上游A-tract元件协同作用，突变任一元件会显著降低模型识别能力。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了强大的甲基化预测工具，并证明了可解释深度学习既能推动方法学创新，又能驱动生物学假说生成，实现了技术突破与机制发现的统一。

Abstract: Accurate computational identification of DNA methylation is essential for understanding epigenetic regulation. Although deep learning excels in this binary classification task, its "black-box" nature impedes biological insight. We address this by introducing a high-performance model MEDNA-DFM, alongside mechanism-inspired signal purification algorithms. Our investigation demonstrates that MEDNA-DFM effectively captures conserved methylation patterns, achieving robust distinction across diverse species. Validation on external independent datasets confirms that the model's generalization is driven by conserved intrinsic motifs (e.g., GC content) rather than phylogenetic proximity. Furthermore, applying our developed algorithms extracted motifs with significantly higher reliability than prior studies. Finally, empirical evidence from a Drosophila 6mA case study prompted us to propose a "sequence-structure synergy" hypothesis, suggesting that the GAGG core motif and an upstream A-tract element function cooperatively. We further validated this hypothesis via in silico mutagenesis, confirming that the ablation of either or both elements significantly degrades the model's recognition capabilities. This work provides a powerful tool for methylation prediction and demonstrates how explainable deep learning can drive both methodological innovation and the generation of biological hypotheses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管SHAP解释通常按输出坐标独立计算，但这一实践的理论必要性尚不明确，导致多输出学习中公平一致解释的范围模糊不清。

Method: 将经典Shapley公理扩展至向量值合作博弈，建立刚性定理刻画多输出预测器的特征归因规则。

Result: 满足效率性、对称性、虚拟玩家和可加性的归因规则必然按输出分量分解，任何联合输出归因规则至少需放宽一条经典公理。

Conclusion: 研究明确了Shapley可解释性中的结构约束，澄清了多输出学习公平一致解释的精确范围，实验表明多输出模型可节省计算成本且保持SHAP一致性。

Abstract: In this article, we provide an axiomatic characterization of feature attribution for multi-output predictors within the Shapley framework. While SHAP explanations are routinely computed independently for each output coordinate, the theoretical necessity of this practice has remained unclear. By extending the classical Shapley axioms to vector-valued cooperative games, we establish a rigidity theorem showing that any attribution rule satisfying efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, and additivity must necessarily decompose component-wise across outputs. Consequently, any joint-output attribution rule must relax at least one of the classical Shapley axioms. This result identifies a previously unformalized structural constraint in Shapley-based interpretability, clarifying the precise scope of fairness-consistent explanations in multi-output learning. Numerical experiments on a biomedical benchmark illustrate that multi-output models can yield computational savings in training and deployment, while producing SHAP explanations that remain fully consistent with the component-wise structure imposed by the Shapley axioms.

Motivation: LoRA在复杂推理任务中存在线性约束，单纯增加秩会出现收益递减，无法突破性能瓶颈

Method: 提出NoRA权重级并行适配器，注入SiLU门控和非结构性dropout来诱导流形扩张，打破线性限制

Result: 在SlimOrca上，秩64的NoRA(PPL 3.89)优于秩512的LoRA(PPL 3.90)；在MathInstruct上NoRA达到1.97困惑度，超越LoRA的饱和点2.07

Conclusion: NoRA通过激活奇异值谱的 dormant 尾部有效防止了线性方法中的秩崩溃，证明非线性结构对提升谱效率至关重要

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) dominates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, it faces a critical ``linear ceiling'' in complex reasoning tasks: simply increasing the rank yields diminishing returns due to intrinsic linear constraints. We introduce NoRA (Non-linear Rank Adaptation), a weight-level parallel adapter that injects SiLU gating and structural dropout to induce manifold expansion. On the SlimOrca benchmark, NoRA breaks this linear barrier: NoRA remarkably at rank 64 (PPL 3.89) outperforms LoRA at rank 512 (PPL 3.90), demonstrating superior spectral efficiency. This advantage generalizes to mathematical reasoning, where NoRA achieves a perplexity of 1.97 on MathInstruct, significantly surpassing LoRA's saturation point of 2.07. Mechanism analysis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) confirms that NoRA activates the dormant tail of the singular value spectrum, effectively preventing the rank collapse observed in linear methods.

TL;DR: Homogeneous neural networks relax algorithmic stability requirements, enabling Ω(1/√t) stepsize decay (vs. standard O(1/t)) for generalization in non-convex training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard algorithmic stability analysis imposes rigid O(1/t) stepsize decay in non-convex training, potentially hindering optimization and mismatching practical scenarios.

Method: Generalization bound derivation under homogeneous neural network regimes with mild assumptions, extended to non-Lipschitz settings.

Result: Proved that homogeneous networks allow slower Ω(1/√t) stepsize decay while maintaining generalization guarantees.

Conclusion: The theory applies broadly to fully-connected/convolutional networks with ReLU/LeakyReLU, offering more practical stepsize flexibility.

Abstract: Algorithmic stability is among the most potent techniques in generalization analysis. However, its derivation usually requires a stepsize $η_t = \mathcal{O}(1/t)$ under non-convex training regimes, where $t$ denotes iterations. This rigid decay of the stepsize potentially impedes optimization and may not align with practical scenarios. In this paper, we derive the generalization bounds under the homogeneous neural network regimes, proving that this regime enables slower stepsize decay of order $Ω(1/\sqrt{t})$ under mild assumptions. We further extend the theoretical results from several aspects, e.g., non-Lipschitz regimes. This finding is broadly applicable, as homogeneous neural networks encompass fully-connected and convolutional neural networks with ReLU and LeakyReLU activations.

Motivation: 通过分析模型性能与参数量、数据集大小及计算预算的缩放关系，优化数据驱动天气预报模型的训练效率与性能。

Method: 对Aurora、GraphCast等天气预报模型进行经验缩放分析，探究验证损失随模型尺寸(N)、数据集大小(D)和计算预算(C)的变化规律。

Result: Aurora数据缩放最强（10倍数据使损失降低3.2倍）；GraphCast参数效率最高但硬件利用率低；固定计算预算下，延长训练比增大模型尺寸更有效；天气预报模型与语言模型不同，始终优先选择增加宽度而非深度。

Conclusion: 未来天气预报模型应采用更宽架构和更大训练数据集以最大化性能，因其缩放规律与语言模型存在本质差异。

Abstract: Data-driven models are revolutionizing weather forecasting. To optimize training efficiency and model performance, this paper analyzes empirical scaling laws within this domain. We investigate the relationship between model performance (validation loss) and three key factors: model size ($N$), dataset size ($D$), and compute budget ($C$). Across a range of models, we find that Aurora exhibits the strongest data-scaling behavior: increasing the training dataset by 10x reduces validation loss by up to 3.2x. GraphCast demonstrates the highest parameter efficiency, yet suffers from limited hardware utilization. Our compute-optimal analysis indicates that, under fixed compute budgets, allocating resources to longer training durations yields greater performance gains than increasing model size. Furthermore, we analyze model shape and uncover scaling behaviors that differ fundamentally from those observed in language models: weather forecasting models consistently favor increased width over depth.

Conclusion: 将ECG视为结构化语言（RhythmBERT）为心脏分析提供了可扩展且符合生理特性的新路径，显著提升标签效率与泛化能力。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is crucial for diagnosing heart disease, but most self-supervised learning methods treat ECG as a generic time series, overlooking physiologic semantics and rhythm-level structure. Existing contrastive methods utilize augmentations that distort morphology, whereas generative approaches employ fixed-window segmentation, which misaligns cardiac cycles. To address these limitations, we propose RhythmBERT, a generative ECG language model that considers ECG as a language paradigm by encoding P, QRS, and T segments into symbolic tokens via autoencoder-based latent representations. These discrete tokens capture rhythm semantics, while complementary continuous embeddings retain fine-grained morphology, enabling a unified view of waveform structure and rhythm. RhythmBERT is pretrained on approximately 800,000 unlabeled ECG recordings with a masked prediction objective, allowing it to learn contextual representations in a label-efficient manner. Evaluations show that despite using only a single lead, RhythmBERT achieves comparable or superior performance to strong 12-lead baselines. This generalization extends from prevalent conditions such as atrial fibrillation to clinically challenging cases such as subtle ST-T abnormalities and myocardial infarction. Our results suggest that considering ECG as structured language offers a scalable and physiologically aligned pathway for advancing cardiac analysis.

TL;DR: 针对大批量LLM训练中激活值占用主要内存的问题，本文提出PRAC激活压缩方法，通过将激活分解为主子空间（SVD保留关键信息）和随机子空间（正交补空间采样）来利用激活的光谱结构，配合精确缩放因子实现无偏低方差梯度估计，在预训练和微调任务中实现36%总内存削减且性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大批量LLM训练中，激活值成为主要内存瓶颈；现有压缩方法未能利用激活的光谱结构特性，导致收敛缓慢或压缩率有限。需要一种既能有效压缩又能保证训练稳定性的新方法。

Method: 提出PRAC（Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression）框架：1）通过SVD分解提取激活的主子空间以保留主要信息；2）在正交补空间中采样随机子空间来近似尾部信息；3）引入精确缩放因子，证明在特定条件下PRAC能产生无偏梯度估计且方差最小。

Result: 在预训练和微调任务上，PRAC实现高达36%的总内存减少，性能下降可忽略不计，且计算开销极低。该方法有效利用了激活的光谱结构，平衡了压缩率与训练效率。

Conclusion: PRAC首次系统地将激活压缩与算法收敛性理论结合，通过主子空间与随机子空间的分解策略，在保证无偏低方差梯度估计的前提下显著降低内存占用，为大批量LLM训练提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Activations have become the primary memory bottleneck in large-batch LLM training. However, existing compression methods fail to exploit the spectral structure of activations, resulting in slow convergence or limited compression. To address this, we bridge the relationship between the algorithm's fast convergence and the requirements for subspace projection, and show that an effective compression should yield an unbiased estimate of the original activation with low variance. We propose Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression (PRAC), which novelly decomposes activations into two components: a principal subspace captured via SVD to retain dominant information, and a random subspace sampled from the orthogonal complement to approximate the tail. By introducing a precise scaling factor, we prove that PRAC yields an unbiased gradient estimator with minimum variance under certain conditions. Extensive experiments on pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that PRAC achieves up to 36% total memory reduction with negligible performance degradation and minimal computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实有向动态图中源节点和目标节点存在非对称行为模式，但现有方法使用共享参数处理两者，缺乏系统的角色感知建模。

Method: 采用角色导向的Transformer架构：1) 为源/目标节点设计独立嵌入词表和位置编码；2) 提出时序对比链接预测(TCLP)自监督预训练目标，利用未标记交互历史学习角色特定表示。

Result: 在未来边分类任务评估中，DyGnROLE大幅优于多种先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 角色感知建模是动态图学习的有效策略，显式区分源/目标节点表示能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world dynamic graphs are often directed, with source and destination nodes exhibiting asymmetrical behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. However, existing dynamic graph architectures largely rely on shared parameters for processing source and destination nodes, with limited or no systematic role-aware modeling. We propose DyGnROLE (Dynamic Graph Node-Role-Oriented Latent Encoding), a transformer-based architecture that explicitly disentangles source and destination representations. By using separate embedding vocabularies and role-semantic positional encodings, the model captures the distinct structural and temporal contexts unique to each role. Critical to the effectiveness of these specialized embeddings in low-label regimes is a self-supervised pretraining objective we introduce: Temporal Contrastive Link Prediction (TCLP). The pretraining uses the full unlabeled interaction history to encode informative structural biases, enabling the model to learn role-specific representations without requiring annotated data. Evaluation on future edge classification demonstrates that DyGnROLE substantially outperforms a diverse set of state-of-the-art baselines, establishing role-aware modeling as an effective strategy for dynamic graph learning.

Conclusion: 数据高效的机器学习方法与自适应实验相结合能显著提升输运性质预测性能，为扩散系数预测提供了新范式

Abstract: Predicting diffusion coefficients in mixtures is crucial for many applications, as experimental data remain scarce, and machine learning (ML) offers promising alternatives to established semi-empirical models. Among ML models, matrix completion methods (MCMs) have proven effective in predicting thermophysical properties, including diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures. However, MCMs are restricted to single-temperature predictions, and their accuracy depends strongly on the availability of high-quality experimental data for each temperature of interest. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a hybrid tensor completion method (TCM) for predicting temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures. The TCM employs a Tucker decomposition and is jointly trained on experimental data for diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary systems at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Predictions from the semi-empirical SEGWE model serve as prior knowledge within a Bayesian training framework. The TCM then extrapolates linearly to any temperature between 268 K and 378 K, achieving markedly improved prediction accuracy compared to established models across all studied temperatures. To further enhance predictive performance, the experimental database was expanded using active learning (AL) strategies for targeted acquisition of new diffusion data by pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR measurements. Diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in 19 solute + solvent systems were measured at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Incorporating these results yields a substantial improvement in the TCM's predictive accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of combining data-efficient ML methods with adaptive experimentation to advance predictive modeling of transport properties.

Motivation: 当前天气分析和预报缺失地表覆盖与地形导致的数十至数百米尺度近地表大气变异，该研究旨在探究此类米级变异是否包含可基于地表特征和大气强迫预测的有序成分，而非完全混沌。

Method: 将粗尺度大气状态条件化于稀疏地面站测量和高分辨率地球观测数据，推断美国本土连续的10米分辨率近地表风场、温度及湿度场。

Result: 相较于ERA5再分析数据，新方法风速误差降低29%，温湿度误差降低6%，并显著提升固定时刻的空间方差解释率；成功刻画城市热岛、蒸散发驱动的湿度差异及不同地表覆盖的风速差异等物理可解释结构。

Conclusion: 该计算可行的方法将天气建模前沿扩展至大陆尺度米级分辨率，证明通过粗动力学模型与细尺度静态特征融合可揭示地球系统先前未解析的成分。

Abstract: Near-surface atmospheric conditions can differ sharply over tens to hundreds of meters due to land cover and topography, yet this variability is absent from current weather analyses and forecasts. It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They also exhibit physically interpretable structure, including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types. Our findings expand the frontier of weather modeling by demonstrating a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference. More broadly, they illustrate how conditioning coarse dynamical models on static fine-scale features can reveal previously unresolved components of the Earth system.

Motivation: 该领域缺乏捕获真实世界时序动态性（审查和非平稳性）的共享、可复现基准，这减缓了方法学进展并限制了Web3与更广泛Web领域之间的技术迁移。

Method: 使用Aave v3协议的2180万条交易记录创建FinSurvival Challenge 2025，实施16个生存预测任务来建模用户行为转换，详细阐述了基准设计并分析了优胜解决方案。

Result: 在生存预测任务中，领域感知的时序特征构建显著优于通用建模方法。

Conclusion: Web3系统为研究如流失、风险和演化等基础时序挑战提供了高保真沙盒，这些挑战对整个Web都至关重要，并为下一代时序基准的设计提供了经验教训。

Abstract: Temporal Web analytics increasingly relies on large-scale, longitudinal data to understand how users, content, and systems evolve over time. A rapidly growing frontier is the \emph{Temporal Web3}: decentralized platforms whose behavior is recorded as immutable, time-stamped event streams. Despite the richness of this data, the field lacks shared, reproducible benchmarks that capture real-world temporal dynamics, specifically censoring and non-stationarity, across extended horizons. This absence slows methodological progress and limits the transfer of techniques between Web3 and broader Web domains. In this paper, we present the \textit{FinSurvival Challenge 2025} as a case study in benchmarking \emph{temporal Web3 intelligence}. Using 21.8 million transaction records from the Aave v3 protocol, the challenge operationalized 16 survival prediction tasks to model user behavior transitions.We detail the benchmark design and the winning solutions, highlighting how domain-aware temporal feature construction significantly outperformed generic modeling approaches. Furthermore, we distill lessons for next-generation temporal benchmarks, arguing that Web3 systems provide a high-fidelity sandbox for studying temporal challenges, such as churn, risk, and evolution that are fundamental to the wider Web.

*Aviral Chawla,Galen Hall,Juniper Lovato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MetaOthello, a suite of Othello variants, to study how transformers organize multiple world models in a shared representation space, finding mostly shared representations that transfer across variants rather than isolated sub-models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models must handle multiple generative processes, but mechanistic interpretability largely studies capabilities in isolation; it remains unclear how a single transformer organizes multiple, potentially conflicting "world models".

Method: Introduce MetaOthello, a controlled suite of Othello variants with shared syntax but different rules or tokenizations, and train small GPTs on mixed-variant data to study how multiple world models are organized in a shared representation space using linear probes and interventions.

Result: Transformers trained on mixed-game data converge on mostly shared board-state representations that transfer causally across variants; linear probes from one variant can effectively intervene on another's internal state; for isomorphic games, representations are equivalent up to orthogonal rotation; when rules partially overlap, early layers are game-agnostic, middle layers identify game identity, and later layers specialize.

Conclusion: MetaOthello offers a path toward understanding not just whether transformers learn world models, but how they organize many at once.

Abstract: Foundation models must handle multiple generative processes, yet mechanistic interpretability largely studies capabilities in isolation; it remains unclear how a single transformer organizes multiple, potentially conflicting "world models". Previous experiments on Othello playing neural-networks test world-model learning but focus on a single game with a single set of rules. We introduce MetaOthello, a controlled suite of Othello variants with shared syntax but different rules or tokenizations, and train small GPTs on mixed-variant data to study how multiple world models are organized in a shared representation space. We find that transformers trained on mixed-game data do not partition their capacity into isolated sub-models; instead, they converge on a mostly shared board-state representation that transfers causally across variants. Linear probes trained on one variant can intervene on another's internal state with effectiveness approaching that of matched probes. For isomorphic games with token remapping, representations are equivalent up to a single orthogonal rotation that generalizes across layers. When rules partially overlap, early layers maintain game-agnostic representations while a middle layer identifies game identity, and later layers specialize. MetaOthello offers a path toward understanding not just whether transformers learn world models, but how they organize many at once.

Method: 通过分析蛋白质语言模型在掩码标记预测中的行为，系统研究其检测精确重复和近似重复的内部机制。

Result: 发现近似重复检测机制在功能上包含精确重复检测机制，并揭示了两阶段工作机制：第一阶段，模型利用通用位置注意力头和生物学特化组件（如编码氨基酸相似性的神经元）构建特征表示；第二阶段，归纳头关注重复片段间的对齐标记以促进正确预测。

Conclusion: 蛋白质语言模型通过结合基于语言的模式匹配与专门生物学知识来解决这一生物任务，为研究模型中更复杂的进化过程奠定了基础。

Abstract: Protein sequences are abundant in repeating segments, both as exact copies and as approximate segments with mutations. These repeats are important for protein structure and function, motivating decades of algorithmic work on repeat identification. Recent work has shown that protein language models (PLMs) identify repeats, by examining their behavior in masked-token prediction. To elucidate their internal mechanisms, we investigate how PLMs detect both exact and approximate repeats. We find that the mechanism for approximate repeats functionally subsumes that of exact repeats. We then characterize this mechanism, revealing two main stages: PLMs first build feature representations using both general positional attention heads and biologically specialized components, such as neurons that encode amino-acid similarity. Then, induction heads attend to aligned tokens across repeated segments, promoting the correct answer. Our results reveal how PLMs solve this biological task by combining language-based pattern matching with specialized biological knowledge, thereby establishing a basis for studying more complex evolutionary processes in PLMs.

Motivation: 传统ROM重训练计算成本高昂，难以实时适应新参数域（如流体力学中的雷诺数变化）。需开发能利用稀疏观测数据快速适配的方法，同时保持精度并提供不确定性量化。

Method: 1. 构建VAE-Transformer混合架构：VAE压缩高维状态至潜空间，Transformer通过注意力机制建模潜态时空演化与参数影响。2. 概率化VAE支持轨迹集成采样，提供预测均值与不确定性。3. 初始训练后，仅用稀疏数据重训练VAE部分（因外推误差主要源于潜流形畸变），结合集成卡尔曼滤波进行数据同化。

Result: 1. 仅需少量稀疏数据即可实现与完全重训练相当的精度，计算时间显著降低。2. 揭示外推误差主因是潜流形畸变而非潜动力学变化。3. 成功应用于Navier-Stokes方程，支持实时轻量适配与全状态轨迹重建。

Conclusion: 所提策略通过针对性重训练VAE模块，解决了ROM参数外推的精度瓶颈，实现了计算高效、数据稀疏的实时适配。为复杂 dynamical systems 的降阶建模提供了可扩展框架，兼具预测精度与不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: We propose an efficient retraining strategy for a parameterized Reduced Order Model (ROM) that attains accuracy comparable to full retraining while requiring only a fraction of the computational time and relying solely on sparse observations of the full system. The architecture employs an encode-process-decode structure: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to perform dimensionality reduction, and a transformer network to evolve the latent states and model the dynamics. The ROM is parameterized by an external control variable, the Reynolds number in the Navier-Stokes setting, with the transformer exploiting attention mechanisms to capture both temporal dependencies and parameter effects. The probabilistic VAE enables stochastic sampling of trajectory ensembles, providing predictive means and uncertainty quantification through the first two moments. After initial training on a limited set of dynamical regimes, the model is adapted to out-of-sample parameter regions using only sparse data. Its probabilistic formulation naturally supports ensemble generation, which we employ within an ensemble Kalman filtering framework to assimilate data and reconstruct full-state trajectories from minimal observations. We further show that, for the dynamical system considered, the dominant source of error in out-of-sample forecasts stems from distortions of the latent manifold rather than changes in the latent dynamics. Consequently, retraining can be limited to the autoencoder, allowing for a lightweight, computationally efficient, real-time adaptation procedure with very sparse fine-tuning data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an "anchoring" technique to bound and control model disagreement (expected squared difference between predictions of independently trained models) for four machine learning algorithms, showing how disagreement can be driven to zero with natural training parameters like model count, iterations, architecture size, or tree depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Control model disagreement (expected squared difference between predictions of two independently trained models) and drive it to zero using natural training parameters with analyses applicable to existing methodologies.

Method: Develop a general technique based on anchoring to the average of two models, then apply it to prove disagreement bounds for stacked aggregation, gradient boosting, neural network architecture search, and regression tree training.

Result: Proved disagreement bounds for four ML algorithms: disagreement decreases to zero with (1) number of models k in stacking, (2) iterations k in boosting, (3) architecture size n in neural nets, and (4) depth d in regression trees; results generalize from 1D regression to multi-dimensional strongly convex loss settings.

Conclusion: The anchoring technique provides a unified framework for analyzing and controlling model disagreement across diverse training procedures, revealing how different natural parameters can eliminate disagreement between independently trained models.

Abstract: Numerous lines of aim to control $\textit{model disagreement}$ -- the extent to which two machine learning models disagree in their predictions. We adopt a simple and standard notion of model disagreement in real-valued prediction problems, namely the expected squared difference in predictions between two models trained on independent samples, without any coordination of the training processes. We would like to be able to drive disagreement to zero with some natural parameter(s) of the training procedure using analyses that can be applied to existing training methodologies.
  We develop a simple general technique for proving bounds on independent model disagreement based on $\textit{anchoring}$ to the average of two models within the analysis. We then apply this technique to prove disagreement bounds for four commonly used machine learning algorithms: (1) stacked aggregation over an arbitrary model class (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the number of models $k$ being stacked) (2) gradient boosting (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the number of iterations $k$) (3) neural network training with architecture search (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the size $n$ of the architecture being optimized over) and (4) regression tree training over all regression trees of fixed depth (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the depth $d$ of the tree architecture). For clarity, we work out our initial bounds in the setting of one-dimensional regression with squared error loss -- but then show that all of our results generalize to multi-dimensional regression with any strongly convex loss.

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理基础的正则化将学习过程建立在最优控制理论基础上，有效改进了离线GCRL的值估计问题

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) learns goal-conditioned policies from static pre-collected datasets. However, accurate value estimation remains a challenge due to the limited coverage of the state-action space. Recent physics-informed approaches have sought to address this by imposing physical and geometric constraints on the value function through regularization defined over first-order partial differential equations (PDEs), such as the Eikonal equation. However, these formulations can often be ill-posed in complex, high-dimensional environments. In this work, we propose a physics-informed regularization derived from the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By providing a physics-based inductive bias, our approach grounds the learning process in optimal control theory, explicitly regularizing and bounding updates during value iterations. Furthermore, we leverage the Feynman-Kac theorem to recast the PDE solution as an expectation, enabling a tractable Monte Carlo estimation of the objective that avoids numerical instability in higher-order gradients. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves geometric consistency, making it broadly applicable to navigation and high-dimensional, complex manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 现有VS模型评估仅检查数据集边缘分布准确性，但模型实际输出的是每个细胞的后验分布，而真实后验不可用，导致评估不完整。

Method: 将信息增益(IG)作为严格正当评分规则，应用于扩散模型和GAN模型的VS评估，通过大规模高通量筛选(HTS)数据集直接量化预测后验质量。

Conclusion: IG提供理论严谨、可解释的细胞级后验评估框架，支持跨模型/特征比较，为VS模型评估设立新标准。

Abstract: Generative virtual staining (VS) models for high-throughput screening (HTS) can provide an estimated posterior distribution of possible biological feature values for each input and cell. However, when evaluating a VS model, the true posterior is unavailable. Existing evaluation protocols only check the accuracy of the marginal distribution over the dataset rather than the predicted posteriors. We introduce information gain (IG) as a cell-wise evaluation framework that enables direct assessment of predicted posteriors. IG is a strictly proper scoring rule and comes with a sound theoretical motivation allowing for interpretability, and for comparing results across models and features. We evaluate diffusion- and GAN-based models on an extensive HTS dataset using IG and other metrics and show that IG can reveal substantial performance differences other metrics cannot.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Coarse data arise when learners observe only partial information about samples; namely, a set containing the sample rather than its exact value. This occurs naturally through measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and lag in economic systems. We study Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data, where each true sample $x$ is drawn from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covariance, but is revealed only through the set of a partition containing $x$. When the coarse samples, roughly speaking, have ``low'' information, the mean cannot be uniquely recovered from observed samples (i.e., the problem is not identifiable). Recent work by Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21] established that sample-efficient mean estimation is possible when the unknown mean is identifiable and the partition consists of only convex sets. Moreover, they showed that without convexity, mean estimation becomes NP-hard. However, two fundamental questions remained open: (1) When is the mean identifiable under convex partitions? (2) Is computationally efficient estimation possible under identifiability and convex partitions? This work resolves both questions. [...]

Method: 核心思想是"伪标签即数据"：假设客户端已预存大型通用无标签参考数据集（如ImageNet），服务器仅传输特定图像的类别标签。通过剪枝机制筛选参考集中与目标任务语义最相关的图像，在提升训练效率的同时最小化传输负载。

Result: 在10个不同数据集上验证，该方法传输载荷小于1MB即可实现任务知识迁移，同时保持高分类准确率。相比传统像素传输方式，通信成本降低数个数量级。

Conclusion: PLADA为高效数据集服务提供了可行方案，通过消除像素传输和智能数据筛选，在异构计算环境中实现低带宽、高性能的分布式学习。该方法在边缘计算和资源受限场景具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: A dataset server must often distribute the same large payload to many clients, incurring massive communication costs. Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload. Experiments on 10 diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach can transfer task knowledge with a payload of less than 1 MB while retaining high classification accuracy, offering a promising solution for efficient dataset serving.

### [135] [Agent Behavioral Contracts: Formal Specification and Runtime Enforcement for Reliable Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22302)
*Varun Pratap Bhardwaj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework applying Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. It defines contracts with preconditions, invariants, governance policies, and recovery mechanisms that are runtime-enforceable. The framework provides probabilistic drift bounds and safe composition guarantees, implemented in AgentAssert with strong empirical results showing 5.2-6.8 more violation detections per session and 88-100% constraint compliance at <10ms overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents lack formal behavioral specifications unlike traditional software that uses APIs, type systems, and assertions. This gap causes behavioral drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in AI deployments, creating an urgent need for formal methods to ensure reliable and controllable agent behavior.

Method: The paper proposes Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC) with structure C=(P,I,G,R) representing Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms. It defines (p, delta, k)-satisfaction as a probabilistic compliance notion accounting for LLM non-determinism. Theoretical contributions include a Drift Bounds Theorem and safe composition conditions for multi-agent systems, implemented via the AgentAssert runtime library and evaluated on AgentContract-Bench with 200 scenarios across 7 models.

Result: Experimental results across 1,980 sessions show contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines completely miss (p<0.0001, Cohen's d=6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, bound behavioral drift to D*<0.27, and provide 100% recovery for frontier models with 17-100% recovery across all tested models, while maintaining runtime overhead below 10ms per action.

Conclusion: The ABC framework successfully bridges the formal specification gap for AI agents, offering theoretically-grounded, practically-implementable contracts that significantly improve governance, detect violations, bound drift, and ensure recoverability with negligible performance impact, making it a viable solution for robust and reliable AI agent deployments.

Abstract: Traditional software relies on contracts -- APIs, type systems, assertions -- to specify and enforce correct behavior. AI agents, by contrast, operate on prompts and natural language instructions with no formal behavioral specification. This gap is the root cause of drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in agentic AI deployments. We introduce Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework that brings Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. An ABC contract C = (P, I, G, R) specifies Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as first-class, runtime-enforceable components. We define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction -- a probabilistic notion of contract compliance that accounts for LLM non-determinism and recovery -- and prove a Drift Bounds Theorem showing that contracts with recovery rate gamma > alpha (the natural drift rate) bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma in expectation, with Gaussian concentration in the stochastic setting. We establish sufficient conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains and derive probabilistic degradation bounds. We implement ABC in AgentAssert, a runtime enforcement library, and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors. Results across 1,980 sessions show that contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines miss entirely (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, and bound behavioral drift to D* < 0.27 across extended sessions, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% across all models, at overhead < 10 ms per action.

### [136] [Vibe Researching as Wolf Coming: Can AI Agents with Skills Replace or Augment Social Scientists?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22401)
*Yongjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出"氛围研究"概念，探讨可自主执行完整研究流程的AI智能体。通过开发认知任务框架（按可编码性与隐性知识需求分类），发现AI擅长速度、覆盖范围和方法论支撑，但在理论原创性和领域隐性知识方面存在局限，指出增强脆弱性、分层风险和教学危机三大影响，并提出负责任的"氛围研究"五项原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体（具备持久状态、工具访问和专家技能的多步推理系统）代表了社会科学领域自动化技术的质变，与仅响应孤立查询的聊天机器人不同。这需要理解如何有效整合这些工具到研究流程中，以及界定其能力边界。

Method: 以Claude Code的21项技能插件"scholar-skill"作为案例，开发认知任务框架，从可编码性和隐性知识需求两个维度对研究活动进行分类，以识别认知层面的（而非顺序性的）委托边界。

Result: AI智能体在执行速度、覆盖范围和方法论支撑方面表现优异，但在理论原创性和领域隐性知识方面存在困难。委托边界贯穿研究流程的每个阶段，而非介于阶段之间。

Conclusion: 本文提出三大影响：脆弱的增强条件、分层风险和教学危机，并总结了五项负责任的"氛围研究"原则。

Abstract: AI agents -- systems that execute multi-step reasoning workflows with persistent state, tool access, and specialist skills -- represent a qualitative shift from prior automation technologies in social science. Unlike chatbots that respond to isolated queries, AI agents can now read files, run code, query databases, search the web, and invoke domain-specific skills to execute entire research pipelines autonomously. This paper introduces the concept of vibe researching -- the AI-era parallel to ``vibe coding'' (Karpathy, 2025) -- and uses scholar-skill, a 21-skill plugin for Claude Code covering the full research pipeline from idea to submission, as an illustrative case. I develop a cognitive task framework that classifies research activities along two dimensions -- codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement -- to identify a delegation boundary that is cognitive, not sequential: it cuts through every stage of the research pipeline, not between stages. I argue that AI agents excel at speed, coverage, and methodological scaffolding but struggle with theoretical originality and tacit field knowledge. The paper concludes with an analysis of three implications for the profession -- augmentation with fragile conditions, stratification risk, and a pedagogical crisis -- and proposes five principles for responsible vibe researching.

### [137] [Towards Autonomous Memory Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22406)
*Xinle Wu,Rui Zhang,Mustafa Anis Hussain,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A paper proposes U-Mem, an autonomous memory agent that actively acquires knowledge via a cost-aware cascade and Thompson sampling, boosting LLM performance by up to 14.6 points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory agents are passive and reactive, bounded by available information, and don't seek external inputs during uncertainties, limiting their memory growth and effectiveness.

Method: Proposes U-Mem with a cost-aware knowledge extraction cascade (cheap signals → tool verification → expert feedback) and semantic-aware Thompson sampling for exploration-exploitation balance.

Result: Outperforms prior memory baselines and RL-based optimization, improving HotpotQA (Qwen2.5-7B) by 14.6 points and AIME25 (Gemini-2.5-flash) by 7.33 points.

Conclusion: Autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge at minimal cost offer significant performance gains over passive approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of U-Mem's cost-aware and exploration strategies.

Abstract: Recent memory agents improve LLMs by extracting experiences and conversation history into an external storage. This enables low-overhead context assembly and online memory update without expensive LLM training. However, existing solutions remain passive and reactive; memory growth is bounded by information that happens to be available, while memory agents seldom seek external inputs in uncertainties. We propose autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge at a minimum cost. U-Mem materializes this idea via (i) a cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade that escalates from cheap self/teacher signals to tool-verified research and, only when needed, expert feedback, and (ii) semantic-aware Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation over memories and mitigate cold-start bias. On both verifiable and non-verifiable benchmarks, U-Mem consistently beats prior memory baselines and can surpass RL-based optimization, improving HotpotQA (Qwen2.5-7B) by 14.6 points and AIME25 (Gemini-2.5-flash) by 7.33 points.

*Caroline Ahn,Quan Do,Leah Bakst,Michael P. Pascale,Joseph T. McGuire,Michael E. Hasselmo,Chantal E. Stern*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个人类认知抽象推理语料库CogARC，通过两个实验（260名参与者）发现人类在解决抽象视觉推理问题时表现出色（准确率80-90%），但表现差异大。困难问题导致更长的思考时间和更多样化的策略。参与者随时间反应更快但准确率略有下降，表明是任务熟悉度而非规则学习能力提高。即使错误解法也常常高度一致，揭示了人类在不确定条件下泛化和适应策略的认知机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类展现出卓越的抽象推理灵活性，能从少量例子中快速学习并应用规则。为探究这种能力背后的认知策略，本研究引入了认知抽象与推理语料库(CogARC)，这是一个为人类适应的抽象推理语料库(ARC)的多样化子集，该语料库最初是为人工智能的抽象推理基准测试而开发的。

Method: 研究开发了CogARC，这是ARC的人类适应子集。通过两个实验，共260名人类参与者自由解决了75个抽象视觉推理问题。要求参与者从少量例子中推断输入-输出规则，以将测试输入转换为正确的测试输出。以高时间分辨率记录了参与者的行为，包括示例查看、编辑序列和多次尝试提交。

Result: 参与者整体表现成功（实验1平均准确率约90%，实验2约80%），但问题间和参与者间存在显著差异。更难的问题引发更长的思考时间和更大的策略分歧。随着任务进行，参与者启动反应更快，但准确率略有下降，表明对任务结构的熟悉度增加而非规则学习能力提高。重要的是，即使错误解法也常常高度一致，尽管问题解决轨迹在长度和平滑度上不同。一些轨迹直接高效地趋向稳定结果，而另一些则涉及广泛探索或部分重启后才收敛。

Conclusion: 这些发现将CogARC突出为一个研究人类抽象推理的丰富行为环境，为人们在泛化、误泛化和在不确定性下适应策略方面提供了深刻见解。

Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable flexibility in abstract reasoning, and can rapidly learn and apply rules from sparse examples. To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging. Together, these findings highlight CogARC as a rich behavioral environment for studying human abstract reasoning, providing insight into how people generalize, misgeneralize, and adapt their strategies under uncertainty.

### [139] [Epistemic Filtering and Collective Hallucination: A Jury Theorem for Confidence-Calibrated Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22413)
*Jonas Karge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个概率框架，异质智能体通过校准阶段学习自身能力，并基于置信度阈值选择性地投票或弃权，证明了非渐近成功概率下界，将孔多塞陪审团定理推广到序贯置信度门控设置，并应用于缓解LLM集体决策中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典投票定理（如孔多塞陪审团定理）假设固定参与，但现实世界的集体决策受益于允许智能体在不确定时弃权（说"我不知道"），需要理解智能体如何学习自身可靠性以及选择性参与如何影响群体准确性。

Method: 提出两阶段概率框架：校准阶段（智能体更新对自身固定能力的信念）和置信度门控阶段（决定是否投票或弃权），通过理论推导和蒙特卡洛模拟验证。

Result: 推导出群体成功概率的非渐近下界，证明选择性参与可将孔多塞陪审团定理的渐近保证推广到序贯、置信度门控设置，蒙特卡洛模拟实证验证了这些边界。

Conclusion: 该框架为集体决策中的选择性参与提供了理论基础，在AI安全领域有潜在应用价值，可通过让LLM在不确定时弃权来缓解集体决策中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: We investigate the collective accuracy of heterogeneous agents who learn to estimate their own reliability over time and selectively abstain from voting. While classical epistemic voting results, such as the \textit{Condorcet Jury Theorem} (CJT), assume fixed participation, real-world aggregation often benefits from allowing agents to say ``I don't know.'' We propose a probabilistic framework where agents engage in a \textit{calibration} phase, updating beliefs about their own fixed competence, before facing a final confidence gate that determines whether to vote or abstain. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the group's success probability and prove that this \textit{selective participation} generalizes the asymptotic guarantees of the CJT to a sequential, confidence-gated setting. Empirically, we validate these bounds via Monte Carlo simulations. While our results are general, we discuss their potential application to AI safety, outlining how this framework can mitigate \textit{hallucinations} in collective LLM decision-making.

### [140] [A Framework for Assessing AI Agent Decisions and Outcomes in AutoML Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22442)
*Gaoyuan Du,Amit Ahlawat,Xiaoyang Liu,Jing Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an Evaluation Agent (EA) for decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents, addressing the limitation of outcome-only evaluation by evaluating intermediate decisions across four dimensions, achieving high fault detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation practices for agent-based AutoML systems are outcome-centric, focusing only on final task performance, lacking structured metrics for evaluating intermediate decision quality, which prevents understanding of failure modes and decision impacts.

Method: Proposed an Evaluation Agent (EA) that acts as an observer to evaluate AutoML agents' intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact.

Result: In four proof-of-concept experiments, the EA achieved 0.919 F1 score in detecting faulty decisions, identified reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and quantified decision impacts on final metrics ranging from -4.9% to +8.3%.

Conclusion: The work reframes AutoML evaluation from outcome-based to decision-auditing, revealing failure modes invisible to traditional metrics and providing a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems.

Abstract: Agent-based AutoML systems rely on large language models to make complex, multi-stage decisions across data processing, model selection, and evaluation. However, existing evaluation practices remain outcome-centric, focusing primarily on final task performance. Through a review of prior work, we find that none of the surveyed agentic AutoML systems report structured, decision-level evaluation metrics intended for post-hoc assessment of intermediate decision quality. To address this limitation, we propose an Evaluation Agent (EA) that performs decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents without interfering with their execution. The EA is designed as an observer that evaluates intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact. Across four proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate that the EA can (i) detect faulty decisions with an F1 score of 0.919, (ii) identify reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and (iii) attribute downstream performance changes to agent decisions, revealing impacts ranging from -4.9\% to +8.3\% in final metrics. These results illustrate how decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes that are invisible to outcome-only metrics. Our work reframes the evaluation of agentic AutoML systems from an outcome-based perspective to one that audits agent decisions, offering a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出对比世界模型（CWM），通过InfoNCE对比损失和困难负样本挖掘，微调大语言模型作为动作可行性评分器。相比监督微调，CWM能将有效动作与物理上不兼容但语义相似的动作在评分空间中拉开距离，在ScienceWorld基准测试中，对最小编辑负样本的Precision@1提升6.76个百分点，AUC-ROC达到0.929，并在分布外压力下保持更优的安全边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的动作可行性评分器是具身智能体的关键瓶颈。现有监督微调方法独立处理每个候选动作，未能显式教导模型区分物理正确和细微错误的动作，尤其难以处理语义相似但物理不兼容的困难负样本。

Method: 提出对比世界模型（CWM），采用InfoNCE对比学习目标，通过挖掘困难负样本微调大语言模型。核心思想是在评分空间中将有效动作与无效动作分离，特别强调语义相似但物理不兼容的困难负样本。

Result: 在ScienceWorld基准测试中：1）内在评估显示，CWM在最小编辑负样本上Precision@1比SFT高6.76个百分点，AUC-ROC为0.929 vs 0.906；2）实时过滤研究表明，在分布外压力下，CWM的安全边界显著更好（-2.39 vs -3.96），黄金路径动作排名更靠前。

Conclusion: 对比训练能诱导模型学习到更忠实于物理可行性的表示，比单纯监督微调更优。

Abstract: A reliable action feasibility scorer is a critical bottleneck in embodied agent pipelines: before any planning or reasoning occurs, the agent must identify which candidate actions are physically executable in the current state. Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone.

### [142] [ConstraintBench: Benchmarking LLM Constraint Reasoning on Direct Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22465)
*Joseph Tso,Preston Schmittou,Quan Huynh,Jibran Hutchins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConstraintBench, a benchmark testing whether LLMs can directly solve constrained optimization problems without solver access. Evaluating six models on 200 tasks across 10 operations research domains, they find feasibility (not optimality) is the main bottleneck: the best model only achieves 65% constraint satisfaction, and no model exceeds 30.5% joint feasibility and optimality. Performance varies widely by domain (0.8% to 83.3% feasibility), with systematic failures including constraint misunderstanding and entity hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs are increasingly used for operational decision-making involving constrained optimization, existing benchmarks only evaluate whether LLMs can formulate problems as solver code. The complementary question remains unanswered: Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver?

Method: The authors introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains. Each of the 200 tasks presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective. Models must return structured solutions that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the Gurobi solver-proven optimum. Six frontier models were evaluated on this benchmark.

Result: Feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89-96% of Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation (feasibility: 83.3% in production mix to 0.8% in crew assignment). Systematic failures include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and feasibility-optimality decoupling (high feasibility but 0% optimality in facility location and vehicle routing).

Conclusion: LLMs struggle significantly with direct constrained optimization, particularly with constraint satisfaction. The large performance variation across domains and identified systematic failure modes highlight critical areas for improvement. The ConstraintBench benchmark and evaluation infrastructure will be publicly released to advance research in this direction.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to operational decision-making where the underlying structure is constrained optimization. Existing benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs can formulate optimization problems as solver code, but leave open a complementary question. Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality. ConstraintBench and all evaluation infrastructure will be publicly released.

Motivation: 当前单个大型语言模型虽日益强大，但许多难题仍超出其能力范围，且如何有效组合多个LLM成为一个整体仍存在不确定性。

Method: 形式化"智能体模板"概念（定义单个LLM的角色及其功能组合方式），并调研现有语言智能体文献，从中识别出基于认知模型或AI算法的底层模板。

Result: 发现了多种源自认知模型和AI算法的语言智能体设计模板。

Conclusion: 基于认知科学和AI的智能体模板是开发有效、可解释语言智能体的强大工具，值得更多关注。

Abstract: While contemporary large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable in isolation, there are still many difficult problems that lie beyond the abilities of a single LLM. For such tasks, there is still uncertainty about how best to take many LLMs as parts and combine them into a greater whole. This position paper argues that potential blueprints for designing such modular language agents can be found in the existing literature on cognitive models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. To make this point clear, we formalize the idea of an agent template that specifies roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed. We then survey a variety of existing language agents in the literature and highlight their underlying templates derived directly from cognitive models or AI algorithms. By highlighting these designs, we aim to call attention to agent templates inspired by cognitive science and AI as a powerful tool for developing effective, interpretable language agents.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key enabler for autonomous radio access networks (RANs), where multiple large language model (LLM)-based agents reason and collaborate to achieve operator-defined intents. The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents.

TL;DR: 提出AHCE框架，通过主动人机协作解决LLM智能体在专业领域因缺乏长尾知识而失败的问题，在Minecraft中显著提升任务成功率，证明学习如何请求专家推理比简单求助更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型智能体在需要训练数据中缺失的长尾知识的专业领域表现不佳，虽然人类专家可补充知识，但其指导往往非结构化和不可靠，难以直接整合到智能体的规划中。

Method: 提出AHCE（主动人机增强挑战参与）框架，核心是Human Feedback Module（HFM），采用学习策略将人类专家作为交互式推理工具进行按需协作。

Result: 在Minecraft中的大量实验表明，该框架在普通难度任务上成功率提升32%，在高难度任务上提升近70%，且仅需极少的人为干预。

Conclusion: 成功增强智能体需要学习如何请求专家推理，而不仅仅是简单求助，这标志着从被动到主动人机协作的重要转变。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents excel at general reasoning but often fail in specialized domains where success hinges on long-tail knowledge absent from their training data. While human experts can provide this missing knowledge, their guidance is often unstructured and unreliable, making its direct integration into an agent's plan problematic. To address this, we introduce AHCE (Active Human-Augmented Challenge Engagement), a framework for on-demand Human-AI collaboration. At its core, the Human Feedback Module (HFM) employs a learned policy to treat the human expert as an interactive reasoning tool. Extensive experiments in Minecraft demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, increasing task success rates by 32% on normal difficulty tasks and nearly 70% on highly difficult tasks, all with minimal human intervention. Our work demonstrates that successfully augmenting agents requires learning how to request expert reasoning, moving beyond simple requests for help.

TL;DR: 提出CourtGuard框架，通过检索增强的多智能体辩论机制解决大语言模型安全机制的适应性僵化问题，在7个安全基准测试中达到最优性能，具备零样本适应性和自动化数据审核能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全机制依赖静态微调的分類器，存在适应性僵化问题，无法在不重新训练的情况下执行新的治理规则。

Method: 提出CourtGuard框架，将安全评估重新构想为"证据辩论"，通过协调基于外部政策文档的对抗性辩论，实现无需微调的安全评估。

Result: 在7个安全基准测试中达到最优性能，零样本适应能力在维基百科破坏任务上达到90%准确率，并成功用于9个新型对抗攻击数据集的整理和审计。

Conclusion: 将安全逻辑与模型权重解耦，为应对当前和未来AI治理监管要求提供了稳健、可解释且可适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Current safety mechanisms for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely heavily on static, fine-tuned classifiers that suffer from adaptation rigidity, the inability to enforce new governance rules without expensive retraining. To address this, we introduce CourtGuard, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that reimagines safety evaluation as Evidentiary Debate. By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks. Our results demonstrate that decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance.

*Weida Liang,Yiyou Sun,Shuyuan Nan,Chuang Li,Dawn Song,Kenji Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文针对示例引导在数学推理中效果不稳定的问题，提出策略可执行性差异是根本原因，并设计选择性策略检索框架(SSR)显式建模可执行性，在多个数学推理基准测试中实现显著且一致的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 示例引导虽能提升数学推理能力，但其效果在不同问题和模型间高度不稳定，即使引导内容正确且相关。现有研究未深入探索策略使用与策略可执行性之间的差距。

Method: 通过对比分析人类编写和模型生成的解决方案，发现策略使用与可执行性存在系统性分离；提出Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR)框架，显式建模可执行性，采用经验性、多路径、源感知信号选择性检索和组合策略。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，SSR相比直接求解、上下文学习和单源引导均获得可靠且一致的改进，在AIME25上提升达13分，在Apex上提升5分。

Conclusion: 策略可执行性差异是导致引导不稳定的根本原因，显式建模可执行性的SSR框架能有效提升紧凑推理模型在数学推理任务上的表现。

Abstract: Example-based guidance is widely used to improve mathematical reasoning at inference time, yet its effectiveness is highly unstable across problems and models-even when the guidance is correct and problem-relevant. We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将心理测量学中的评估者模型引入AI流程，通过项目反应理论（如多层面Rasch模型）校正人类评分中的系统性误差（如严厉度和趋中效应），从而提升AI模型训练与评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类评估在AI模型训练与评估中至关重要，但很少被当作存在系统误差的测量数据来处理，导致结论的可靠性和有效性不足。

Method: 整合心理测量学评估者模型（特别是多层面Rasch模型）到AI流程中，通过校正评估者严厉度等效应，分离真实输出质量与评估者行为偏差。

Result: 以OpenAI摘要数据集为例，校正后得到更准确的摘要质量估计，并能诊断评估者表现，提供更透明的人类数据使用方式。

Conclusion: 将心理测量学建模融入人在环评估，可推动AI开发与评估向更稳健、可解释且符合构念效度的方向发展。

Abstract: Human evaluations play a central role in training and assessing AI models, yet these data are rarely treated as measurements subject to systematic error. This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings. This perspective highlights a path toward more robust, interpretable, and construct-aligned practices for AI development and evaluation.

*Sanjay Kariyappa,G. Edward Suh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SideQuest方法，利用大推理模型自身通过推理判断token重要性来压缩KV缓存，作为并行辅助任务避免记忆污染，仅215样本训练即减少65%峰值token使用且精度损失小，优于传统启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长程智能体任务需跨多网页/文档进行多跳推理，外部检索token占满上下文导致内存快速膨胀并限制解码性能，现有KV缓存压缩启发式方法无法有效支持多步推理模型。

Method: SideQuest让大推理模型自身执行KV缓存压缩，通过推理分析上下文中各token的有用性，并将压缩过程设计为与主任务并行的辅助任务，避免管理token污染模型记忆。

Result: 仅用215个样本训练，在智能体任务上峰值token使用量减少高达65%，精度损失极小，性能超越基于启发式的KV缓存压缩技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模型自身推理实现高效KV缓存压缩，成功解决了长上下文智能体任务的内存瓶颈问题，为资源受限下的复杂推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long-running agentic tasks, such as deep research, require multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple webpages and documents. In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MobilityBench, a reproducible benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents using real-world user queries and a deterministic API sandbox, finding that current models struggle with preference-constrained routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based route-planning agents lack systematic evaluation in real-world settings due to diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility, hindering progress in personalized mobility applications.

Method: The researchers created MobilityBench from large-scale anonymized real user queries from Amap, designed a deterministic API-replay sandbox to eliminate environmental variance, and developed a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol assessing outcome validity, instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency.

Result: Evaluation of multiple LLM-based agents revealed competent performance on basic information retrieval and route planning, but significant struggles with preference-constrained route planning across diverse real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: There is substantial room for improvement in personalized mobility applications, particularly in handling complex user preferences, and the publicly released benchmark enables standardized evaluation for future development.

Abstract: Route-planning agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for supporting everyday human mobility through natural language interaction and tool-mediated decision making. However, systematic evaluation in real-world mobility settings is hindered by diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility. In this study, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route-planning intents across multiple cities worldwide. To enable reproducible, end-to-end evaluation, we design a deterministic API-replay sandbox that eliminates environmental variance from live services. We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity, complemented by assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using MobilityBench, we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. Our findings reveal that current models perform competently on Basic information retrieval and Route Planning tasks, yet struggle considerably with Preference-Constrained Route Planning, underscoring significant room for improvement in personalized mobility applications. We publicly release the benchmark data, evaluation toolkit, and documentation at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MobilityBench .

### [151] [AHBid: An Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding Framework for Cross-Channel Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22650)
*Xinxin Yang,Yangyang Tang,Yikun Zhou,Yaolei Liu,Yun Li,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AHBid is a hierarchical auto-bidding framework that combines diffusion-based generative planning with real-time control for multi-channel advertising, improving ROI by 13.57%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-channel online advertising requires dynamic budget allocation and bid optimization, but current methods lack flexibility (optimization-based) or struggle with historical dependencies (reinforcement learning).

Method: Proposes a hierarchical framework with: 1) high-level diffusion-based generative planner for budget/constraint allocation using historical context, 2) constraint enforcement mechanism, 3) trajectory refinement using historical data, and 4) low-level control-based bidding algorithm combining historical and real-time information.

Result: Achieves 13.57% higher overall return compared to baselines, validated on large-scale offline datasets and online A/B tests.

Conclusion: The integrated generative planning and real-time control approach effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, demonstrating significant improvements in adaptability and operational efficacy for auto-bidding systems.

Abstract: In online advertising, the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of advertising environments necessitate the use of auto-bidding services to assist advertisers in bid optimization. This complexity is further compounded in multi-channel scenarios, where effective allocation of budgets and constraints across channels with distinct behavioral patterns becomes critical for optimizing return on investment. Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale offline datasets and through online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of AHBid, yielding a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM agents operate over extended horizons, their effectiveness depends on adapting to individual users and maintaining temporal continuity, requiring personalization that permeates the entire decision pipeline beyond surface-level generation.

Method: Capability-oriented literature review organized around four interdependent components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution, synthesizing methods and analyzing cross-component interactions and design trade-offs.

Result: Provides a structured framework examining user signal representation/propagation, evaluation metrics/benchmarks, application scenarios across domains, and identifies recurring design trade-offs in personalized agent systems.

Conclusion: Charts a roadmap toward more user-aligned, adaptive, and deployable agentic systems, accelerating progress from prototype personalization to scalable real-world assistants.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled agents that reason, plan, and interact with tools and environments to accomplish complex tasks. As these agents operate over extended interaction horizons, their effectiveness increasingly depends on adapting behavior to individual users and maintaining continuity across time, giving rise to personalized LLM-powered agents. In such long-term, user-dependent settings, personalization permeates the entire decision pipeline rather than remaining confined to surface-level generation. This survey provides a capability-oriented review of personalized LLM-powered agents. We organize the literature around four interdependent components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution. Using this taxonomy, we synthesize representative methods and analyze how user signals are represented, propagated, and utilized, highlighting cross-component interactions and recurring design trade-offs. We further examine evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored to personalized agents, summarize application scenarios spanning general assistance to specialized domains, and outline future directions for research and deployment. By offering a structured framework for understanding and designing personalized LLM-powered agents, this survey charts a roadmap toward more user-aligned, adaptive, robust, and deployable agentic systems, accelerating progress from prototype personalization to scalable real-world assistants.

Motivation: 推荐模型性能受训练数据质量限制，多源辅助域数据可缓解数据稀疏和冷启动问题，但域间差异导致负迁移；现有模型中心范式依赖复杂架构，难以捕捉跨域非结构化序列依赖，泛化性差且计算成本高

Method: 采用数据为中心框架Taesar，通过对比解码机制动态编码跨域上下文到目标域序列，实现目标对齐的序列再生，使标准模型无需复杂融合架构即可学习跨域依赖

Result: 在实验中显著优于模型中心方案，可泛化至多种序列推荐模型，通过生成增强数据集有效结合数据与模型中心范式优势

Conclusion: 数据重生成方法为跨域推荐提供新思路，证明通过优化数据质量而非模型复杂度可突破负迁移瓶颈，兼具高效性与通用性

Abstract: Recommendation model performance is intrinsically tied to the quality, volume, and relevance of their training data. To address common challenges like data sparsity and cold start, recent researchs have leveraged data from multiple auxiliary domains to enrich information within the target domain. However, inherent domain gaps can degrade the quality of mixed-domain data, leading to negative transfer and diminished model performance. Existing prevailing \emph{model-centric} paradigm -- which relies on complex, customized architectures -- struggles to capture the subtle, non-structural sequence dependencies across domains, leading to poor generalization and high demands on computational resources. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textsc{Taesar}, a \emph{data-centric} framework for \textbf{t}arget-\textbf{a}lign\textbf{e}d \textbf{s}equenti\textbf{a}l \textbf{r}egeneration, which employs a contrastive decoding mechanism to adaptively encode cross-domain context into target-domain sequences. It employs contrastive decoding to encode cross-domain context into target sequences, enabling standard models to learn intricate dependencies without complex fusion architectures. Experiments show \textsc{Taesar} outperforms model-centric solutions and generalizes to various sequential models. By generating enriched datasets, \textsc{Taesar} effectively combines the strengths of data- and model-centric paradigms.

*Satya Borgohain,Roy Mariathas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究分解了HealthBench医疗AI评估中的医生分歧，发现81.8%的分歧方差无法通过评分标准、医生身份或元数据解释。分歧在边界案例最高（与质量呈倒U型关系）。可减少的不确定性使分歧几率加倍但仅解释少量方差，不可减少的不确定性无影响。医疗AI评估的一致性上限主要为结构性，但改进信息缺口可在非固有临床模糊的情况下降低分歧，指向评估设计的可操作改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分解HealthBench医疗AI评估数据集中的医生分歧，以了解方差来源以及哪些可观察特征可以解释这些分歧。

Method: 在HealthBench数据集中分解医生分歧，分析评分标准身份、医生身份和案例层面的残差，测试元数据标签、规范评分标准语言、医疗专业、表面特征分诊和嵌入向量等因素，探究分歧与完成质量的关系（倒U型），并使用医生验证的不确定性类别（可减少 vs 不可减少的不确定性）进行分析。

Result: 评分标准身份占满足/不满足标签方差的15.8%，但仅占分歧方差的3.6-6.9%；医生身份仅占2.4%。占主导地位的81.8%案例层面残差无法通过HealthBench的元数据标签（z = -0.22, p = 0.83）、规范评分标准语言（伪R² = 1.2%）、医疗专业（0/300 Tukey对显著）、表面特征分诊（AUC = 0.58）或嵌入向量（AUC = 0.485）来减少。分歧与完成质量呈倒U型关系（AUC = 0.689），证实医生在明显好或坏的输出上达成一致，但在边界案例上存在分歧。医生验证的可减少不确定性类别（缺失上下文、模糊表述）使分歧几率增加一倍以上（OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)），而不可减少不确定性（真正的医学模糊性）没有影响（OR = 1.01, p = 0.90），尽管前者仅解释约3%的总方差。

Conclusion: 医疗AI评估中的一致性上限在很大程度上是结构性的，但可减少/不可减少不确定性的分离表明，在评估场景中缩小信息差距可以在固有临床模糊性不存在的情况下降低分歧，从而指向可操作的评估设计改进方向。

Abstract: We decompose physician disagreement in the HealthBench medical AI evaluation dataset to understand where variance resides and what observable features can explain it. Rubric identity accounts for 15.8% of met/not-met label variance but only 3.6-6.9% of disagreement variance; physician identity accounts for just 2.4%. The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance. The agreement ceiling in medical AI evaluation is thus largely structural, but the reducible/irreducible dissociation suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could lower disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity does not, pointing toward actionable evaluation design improvements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文指出现有LLM智能体记忆评估标准与实际应用存在差距（现有基准侧重对话交互，而真实场景需要处理机器生成的环境交互流）。为此提出AMA-Bench评估基准和AMA-Agent记忆系统，后者通过因果图和工具增强检索，在基准测试中以57.22%的平均准确率超越最强基线11.16%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体记忆基准主要关注以对话为中心的人机交互，但实际应用中智能体记忆由机器生成的环境交互连续流构成，这导致评估标准与实际需求脱节，无法有效衡量长时程记忆能力。

Method: 1. 构建AMA-Bench基准：包含真实世界智能体轨迹（专家标注QA）和可扩展到任意长度的合成轨迹（规则标注QA）；2. 提出AMA-Agent系统：采用因果图记录交互关系，结合工具增强检索机制解决现有系统的因果缺失和基于相似度检索的信息损失问题。

Result: AMA-Agent在AMA-Bench上达到57.22%的平均准确率，相比最强基线提升11.16个百分点。实验揭示现有记忆系统因缺乏因果信息和目标导向而表现不佳，且相似度检索机制存在信息损失。

Conclusion: 通过因果图结构化和工具增强检索，AMA-Agent有效解决了长时程记忆中的关键问题，建立的AMA-Bench为智能体记忆评估提供了更贴近实际的标准，推动了LLM智能体在复杂应用中的能力发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as autonomous agents in increasingly complex applications, where enabling long-horizon memory is critical for achieving strong performance. However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究开发了ClinDet-Bench基准测试，发现大型语言模型在临床信息不完整时无法准确判断是否可作决策，导致过早下结论或过度保守，揭示现有基准不足以评估临床场景下的模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策常在信息不完整时做出，专家需判断信息是否足够；过早结论和不必要 abstention 都会危及患者安全。需要评估 LLMs 在此场景下的能力。

Method: 开发 ClinDet-Bench 基准，基于临床评分系统将不完整信息场景分解为可确定和不可确定条件。识别可确定性需考虑所有关于缺失信息的假设（包括不太可能的），并验证结论是否成立。

Result: 近期 LLMs 在信息不完整时无法识别可确定性，产生过早判断和过度 abstention，尽管它们能正确解释评分知识且在完整信息下表现良好。

Conclusion: 现有基准不足以评估临床场景下 LLMs 的安全性。ClinDet-Bench 提供了评估可确定性识别的框架，促进适当 abstention，适用于医学和其他高风险领域。

Abstract: Clinical decisions are often required under incomplete information. Clinical experts must identify whether available information is sufficient for judgment, as both premature conclusion and unnecessary abstention can compromise patient safety. To evaluate this capability of large language models (LLMs), we developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. Identifying determinability requires considering all hypotheses about missing information, including unlikely ones, and verifying whether the conclusion holds across them. We find that recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention, despite correctly explaining the underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate the safety of LLMs in clinical settings. ClinDet-Bench provides a framework for evaluating determinability recognition, leading to appropriate abstention, with potential applicability to medicine and other high-stakes domains, and is publicly available.

Conclusion: 希望为深度研究社区提供一个易于获取、可复现且可比较的基线

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), the capabilities of standalone LLMs have begun to plateau when tackling real-world, complex tasks that require interaction with external tools and dynamic environments. Although recent agent frameworks aim to enhance model autonomy through tool integration and external interaction, they still suffer from naive workflows, unstable performance, limited support across diverse benchmarks and tasks, and heavy reliance on costly commercial APIs. In this work, we propose a high-performance and robust open-source agent framework, termed MiroFlow, which incorporates an agent graph for flexible orchestration, an optional deep reasoning mode to enhance performance, and a robust workflow execution to ensure stable and reproducible performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MiroFlow consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple agent benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp-EN/ZH, HLE, xBench-DeepSearch, and notably FutureX. We hope it could serve as an easily accessible, reproducible, and comparable baseline for the deep research community.

Result: Identified key performance factors (dataset structural diversity, learning rate, data sparsity, pretraining benefits, metadata utility) and demonstrated retrieval benchmarks simulating real-world molecular identification scenarios.

Conclusion: FlexMS provides standardized evaluation and practical guidance for selecting optimal models in mass spectrum prediction, advancing reproducibility and applicability in cheminformatics.

Abstract: The identification and property prediction of chemical molecules is of central importance in the advancement of drug discovery and material science, where the tandem mass spectrometry technology gives valuable fragmentation cues in the form of mass-to-charge ratio peaks. However, the lack of experimental spectra hinders the attachment of each molecular identification, and thus urges the establishment of prediction approaches for computational models. Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics. In this paper, we provide insights into factors influencing performance, including the structural diversity of datasets, hyperparameters like learning rate and data sparsity, pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings and cross-domain transfer learning analysis. This provides practical guidance in choosing suitable models. Moreover, retrieval benchmarks simulate practical identification scenarios and score potential matches based on predicted spectra.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepPresenter is an autonomous agentic framework that uses environment-grounded reflection on rendered slides to enable long-horizon refinement, achieving state-of-the-art presentation generation with a cost-effective 9B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing presentation agents rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates, lacking adaptability to diverse user intents and capability for effective iterative refinement based on actual presentation artifacts.

Method: The framework autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts, using environment-grounded reflection that conditions generation on perceptual states of rendered slides rather than internal reasoning traces.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse presentation-generation scenarios, with a fine-tuned 9B model maintaining high competitiveness at substantially lower cost.

Conclusion: DeepPresenter successfully generalizes beyond scripted pipelines through artifact-based reflection, demonstrating effective long-horizon refinement for presentation generation.

Abstract: Presentation generation requires deep content research, coherent visual design, and iterative refinement based on observation. However, existing presentation agents often rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates. To address this, we present DeepPresenter, an agentic framework that adapts to diverse user intents, enables effective feedback-driven refinement, and generalizes beyond a scripted pipeline. Specifically, DeepPresenter autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts to support long-horizon refinement with environmental observations. Furthermore, rather than relying on self-reflection over internal signals (e.g., reasoning traces), our environment-grounded reflection conditions the generation process on perceptual artifact states (e.g., rendered slides), enabling the system to identify and correct presentation-specific issues during execution. Results on the evaluation set covering diverse presentation-generation scenarios show that DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance, and the fine-tuned 9B model remains highly competitive at substantially lower cost.

Abstract: The promise of general-purpose agents - systems that perform tasks in unfamiliar environments without domain-specific engineering - remains largely unrealized. Existing agents are predominantly specialized, and while emerging implementations like OpenAI SDK Agent and Claude Code hint at broader capabilities, no systematic evaluation of their general performance has been pursued. Current agentic benchmarks assume domain-specific integration, encoding task information in ways that preclude fair evaluation of general agents. This paper frames general-agent evaluation as a first-class research objective. We propose conceptual principles for such evaluation, a Unified Protocol enabling agent-benchmark integration, and Exgentic - a practical framework for general agent evaluation. We benchmark five prominent agent implementations across six environments as the first Open General Agent Leaderboard. Our experiments show that general agents generalize across diverse environments, achieving performance comparable to domain-specific agents without any environment-specific tuning. We release our evaluation protocol, framework, and leaderboard to establish a foundation for systematic research on general-purpose agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大模型在视频虚假信息检测中存在推理深度固定、过度依赖内部假设的问题，尤其在证据稀疏、零散或需外部验证时可靠性不足。

Method: FactGuard智能体框架将验证建模为迭代推理过程，显式评估任务模糊性，选择性地调用外部工具获取关键证据；采用领域特定的智能体监督微调和决策感知强化学习两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在FakeSV、FakeTT和FakeVV数据集上实现最优性能，展现出卓越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 智能体迭代推理与优化工具使用有效解决了MLLM在视频虚假信息检测中的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have substantially advanced video misinformation detection through unified multimodal reasoning, but they often rely on fixed-depth inference and place excessive trust in internally generated assumptions, particularly in scenarios where critical evidence is sparse, fragmented, or requires external verification. To address these limitations, we propose FactGuard, an agentic framework for video misinformation detection that formulates verification as an iterative reasoning process built upon MLLMs. FactGuard explicitly assesses task ambiguity and selectively invokes external tools to acquire critical evidence, enabling progressive refinement of reasoning trajectories. To further strengthen this capability, we introduce a two-stage training strategy that combines domain-specific agentic supervised fine-tuning with decision-aware reinforcement learning to optimize tool usage and calibrate risk-sensitive decision making. Extensive experiments on FakeSV, FakeTT, and FakeVV demonstrate FactGuard's state-of-the-art performance and validate its excellent robustness and generalization capacity.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current circuit discovery methods in mechanistic interpretability are brittle, heavily dependent on the specific concept dataset used, and fail to transfer out-of-distribution, raising questions about whether they capture true concepts or just dataset-specific artifacts.

Method: They propose Certified Circuits, which wraps any black-box discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling to certify that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset. Unstable neurons are abstained from (excluded).

Result: On ImageNet and OOD datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons, and remain reliable where baseline methods degrade.

Conclusion: This work puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept.

Abstract: Understanding how neural networks arrive at their predictions is essential for debugging, auditing, and deployment. Mechanistic interpretability pursues this goal by identifying circuits - minimal subnetworks responsible for specific behaviors. However, existing circuit discovery methods are brittle: circuits depend strongly on the chosen concept dataset and often fail to transfer out-of-distribution, raising doubts whether they capture concept or dataset-specific artifacts. We introduce Certified Circuits, which provide provable stability guarantees for circuit discovery. Our framework wraps any black-box discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling to certify that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset. Unstable neurons are abstained from, yielding circuits that are more compact and more accurate. On ImageNet and OOD datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons, and remain reliable where baselines degrade. Certified Circuits puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept. Code will be released soon!

Motivation: 大模型在通用推理方面取得突破，但在专业科学领域存在显著能力缺口。现有基准测试面临数据污染、复杂度不足和人工成本高昂三大挑战，特别是在扫描探针显微镜等专业领域缺乏高质量评估工具。

Method: 提出SPM-Bench博士级多模态基准；开发全自动数据合成管道，结合Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS)技术从2023-2025年arXiv和期刊论文中提取高质量图文对；采用云-本地混合架构，VLMs仅返回空间坐标"llbox"进行本地高清裁剪，实现token节省和数据纯度保持；设计严格缺陷惩罚F1 (SIP-F1)评分指标；通过相关分析揭示模型报告置信度、感知难度与实际表现的关系。

Conclusion: SPM-Bench为科学数据自动化合成建立了可推广的范式，SIP-F1指标创新性地量化了AI模型人格特征，为评估大模型在专业科学领域的推理能力提供了新框架，有助于更准确地理解AI在复杂科学问题中的能力边界。

Abstract: As LLMs achieved breakthroughs in general reasoning, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains reveals pronounced gaps in existing benchmarks due to data contamination, insufficient complexity, and prohibitive human labor costs. Here we present SPM-Bench, an original, PhD-level multimodal benchmark specifically designed for scanning probe microscopy (SPM). We propose a fully automated data synthesis pipeline that ensures both high authority and low-cost. By employing Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS) technology, we efficiently extract high-value image-text pairs from arXiv and journal papers published between 2023 and 2025. Through a hybrid cloud-local architecture where VLMs return only spatial coordinates "llbox" for local high-fidelity cropping, our pipeline achieves extreme token savings while maintaining high dataset purity. To accurately and objectively evaluate the performance of the LLMs, we introduce the Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1) score. This metric not only establishes a rigorous capability hierarchy but also, for the first time, quantifies model "personalities" (Conservative, Aggressive, Gambler, or Wise). By correlating these results with model-reported confidence and perceived difficulty, we expose the true reasoning boundaries of current AI in complex physical scenarios. These insights establish SPM-Bench as a generalizable paradigm for automated scientific data synthesis.

Motivation: 在安全关键型临床AI中，人机协同验证至关重要，但模型初始推理与专家修正之间的转换很少被作为结构化信号进行分析。

Method: 构建诊断对齐框架：1) 保持AI生成报告为不可变推理状态；2) 系统比较医生验证结果；3) 推理流程集成视觉大语言模型、BERT医学实体提取和顺序语言模型推理(SLMI)进行领域一致性精调；4) 采用四级一致性评估体系(PMR精确匹配率、AMR语义相似度调整率、跨类别对齐、CCR全面一致率)，在21例皮肤病案例(21对AI-医生)上验证。

Result: 精确匹配率71.4%，语义相似度调整后无显著变化(t=0.60)；结构化跨类别和差异重叠分析实现100%全面一致性(95% CI: [83.9%, 100%])，无完全诊断分歧案例。证明二元词汇评估严重低估临床意义对齐。

Conclusion: 将专家验证建模为结构化转换可实现修正动态的信号感知量化，支持可追溯、人类对齐的图像临床决策支持系统评估。

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop validation is essential in safety-critical clinical AI, yet the transition between initial model inference and expert correction is rarely analyzed as a structured signal. We introduce a diagnostic alignment framework in which the AI-generated image based report is preserved as an immutable inference state and systematically compared with the physician-validated outcome. The inference pipeline integrates a vision-enabled large language model, BERT- based medical entity extraction, and a Sequential Language Model Inference (SLMI) step to enforce domain-consistent refinement prior to expert review. Evaluation on 21 dermatological cases (21 complete AI physician pairs) em- ployed a four-level concordance framework comprising exact primary match rate (PMR), semantic similarity-adjusted rate (AMR), cross-category alignment, and Comprehensive Concordance Rate (CCR). Exact agreement reached 71.4% and remained unchanged under semantic similarity (t = 0.60), while structured cross-category and differential overlap analysis yielded 100% comprehensive concordance (95% CI: [83.9%, 100%]). No cases demonstrated complete diagnostic divergence. These findings show that binary lexical evaluation substantially un- derestimates clinically meaningful alignment. Modeling expert validation as a structured transformation enables signal-aware quantification of correction dynamics and supports traceable, human aligned evaluation of image based clinical decision support systems.

Result: 在广泛实验中显著优于现有EEG表示方法，展现出卓越的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效解决了当前SPD-based方法的结构局限性，为EEG脑活动解码提供了更优的几何深度学习解决方案

Abstract: Decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for neuroscience and clinical applications. Among recent advances in deep learning for EEG, geometric learning stands out as its theoretical underpinnings on symmetric positive definite (SPD) allows revealing structural connectivity analysis in a physics-grounded manner. However, current SPD-based methods focus predominantly on statistical aggregation of EEGs, with frequency-specific synchronization and local topological structures of brain regions neglected. Given this, we propose RepSPD, a novel geometric deep learning (GDL)-based model. RepSPD implements a cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate the geometric attributes of SPD with graph-derived functional connectivity features. On top of this, we introduce a global bidirectional alignment strategy to reshape tangent-space embeddings, mitigating geometric distortions caused by curvature and thereby enhancing geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing EEG representation methods, exhibiting superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 证实文言文能有效暴露大语言模型安全漏洞，为安全防御提供新视角

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used, their security risks have drawn increasing attention. Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks. To enhance readability and evaluation accuracy, we further design a classical Chinese to English translation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed CC-BOS, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework for Formula 1 race strategy that uses an interaction module and self-play to optimize multi-agent decisions on energy, tires, and pit stops while adapting to competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: F1 race strategies must dynamically adapt to changing race conditions and competitor actions, requiring a multi-agent approach that traditional methods cannot adequately address.

Method: Multi-agent reinforcement learning built on a pre-trained single-agent policy, enhanced with an interaction module to model competitor behavior and a self-play training scheme to learn competitive strategies balancing energy management, tire degradation, aerodynamic interaction, and pit-stop decisions.

Result: Agents successfully adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance with competitive ranking based on relative performance.

Conclusion: The framework uses only information available during real races, making it practical for supporting race strategists' decisions before and during actual competitions.

Abstract: In Formula 1, race strategies are adapted according to evolving race conditions and competitors' actions. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent race strategy optimization. Agents learn to balance energy management, tire degradation, aerodynamic interaction, and pit-stop decisions. Building on a pre-trained single-agent policy, we introduce an interaction module that accounts for the behavior of competitors. The combination of the interaction module and a self-play training scheme generates competitive policies, and agents are ranked based on their relative performance. Results show that the agents adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance. Because the framework relies only on information available during real races, it can support race strategists' decisions before and during races.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The CVRP is a fundamental NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that poses significant computational challenges, especially for large-scale instances. Traditional heuristic design requires extensive domain expertise and manual tuning, which the paper aims to overcome using LLMs for automatic heuristic design.

Method: The paper proposes AILS-AHD (Adaptive Iterated Local Search with Automatic Heuristic Design), which integrates an evolutionary search framework with LLMs to dynamically generate and optimize ruin heuristics. It also includes an LLM-based acceleration mechanism to improve computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed AILS-AHD method demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art solvers (AILS-II and HGS) across both moderate and large-scale CVRP instances. Notably, it established new best-known solutions for 8 out of 10 instances in the CVRPLib large-scale benchmark.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the significant potential of LLM-driven heuristic design in advancing vehicle routing optimization, showing that LLMs can effectively automate the heuristic design process and achieve competitive results.

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge, focuses on optimizing fleet operations under vehicle capacity constraints. While extensively studied in operational research, the NP-hard nature of CVRP continues to pose significant computational challenges, particularly for large-scale instances.

Additionally, we introduce an LLM-based acceleration mechanism to enhance computational efficiency.

TL;DR: AI agents competing for limited resources form emergent tribal behaviors that worsen system performance and increase failure rates, with smarter agents performing worse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how autonomous AI agents behave when controlling near-future infrastructure systems that involve repeated competition for limited resources like energy, bandwidth, or computing power.

Method: Studied a simplified setting where N AI agents independently decide each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C, creating an AI version of "Lord of the Flies" scenario.

Result: LLM agents failed to reduce overload or improve resource utilization, performing worse than random decisions. Three tribal types emerged: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). More capable AI agents increased systemic failure rates.

Conclusion: The formation of tribal identities causes smarter AI agents to behave dumber collectively, leading to worse overall system performance.

Abstract: Near-future infrastructure systems may be controlled by autonomous AI agents that repeatedly request access to limited resources such as energy, bandwidth, or computing power. We study a simplified version of this setting using a framework where N AI-agents independently decide at each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C. An AI version of "Lord of the Flies" arises in which controlling tribes emerge with their own collective character and identity. The LLM agents do not reduce overload or improve resource use, and often perform worse than if they were flipping coins to make decisions. Three main tribal types emerge: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). The more capable AI-agents actually increase the rate of systemic failure. Overall, our findings show that smarter AI-agents can behave dumber as a result of forming tribes.

Conclusion: MALLET 提供了不限制原文访问的冷静信息接收框架，平衡了情感刺激控制与语义保真度，为信息消费者提供了可调节的"情绪 detox"工具。

Abstract: In the attention economy, sensational content exposes consumers to excessive emotional stimulation, hindering calm decision-making. This study proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET), a multi-agent information sanitization system consisting of four agents: Emotion Analysis, Emotion Adjustment, Balance Monitoring, and Personal Guide. The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, whereas the effect was limited in the World category, where facts themselves are inherently high-stimulus. The proposed system provides a framework for supporting calm information reception of consumers without restricting access to the original text.

*Nitin Gupta,Vishal Pallagani,John A. Aydin,Biplav Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes learning explicit neural transition models for generalized planning instead of directly predicting actions, showing superior out-of-distribution performance with less data and smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent transformer-based planners (PlanGPT, Plansformer) use direct action-sequence prediction but suffer from state drift, require massive datasets and model sizes, and lack explicit world-state evolution. This creates need for more sample-efficient and robust approaches.

Method: Formulates generalized planning as transition-model learning where a neural network approximates the successor-state function γ̂ ≈ γ. The model autoregressively predicts intermediate symbolic world states and generates plans by rolling out state trajectories, learning domain dynamics as an implicit world model. Evaluates multiple state representations and architectures including relational graph encodings.

Result: Explicit transition models achieve higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success rates than direct action prediction, while requiring significantly fewer training instances and smaller model sizes across multiple domains.

Conclusion: Learning explicit transition models provides more sample-efficient and generalizable generalized planning compared to action-sequence prediction, addressing key limitations of current transformer-based approaches through proper world-state modeling.

Abstract: Generalized planning studies the construction of solution strategies that generalize across families of planning problems sharing a common domain model, formally defined by a transition function $γ: S \times A \rightarrow S$. Classical approaches achieve such generalization through symbolic abstractions and explicit reasoning over $γ$. In contrast, recent Transformer-based planners, such as PlanGPT and Plansformer, largely cast generalized planning as direct action-sequence prediction, bypassing explicit transition modeling. While effective on in-distribution instances, these approaches typically require large datasets and model sizes, and often suffer from state drift in long-horizon settings due to the absence of explicit world-state evolution. In this work, we formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, in which a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function $\hatγ \approx γ$ and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. Instead of predicting actions directly, the model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states, thereby learning the domain dynamics as an implicit world model. To study size-invariant generalization and sample efficiency, we systematically evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures, including relational graph encodings. Our results show that learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models. This is an extended version of a short paper accepted at ICAPS 2026 under the same title.

TL;DR: 本文提出"一致性三位一体"理论框架，揭示世界模型需具备模态一致性、空间一致性和时间一致性，并推出CoW-Bench基准测试，为通用世界模型的发展提供理论指导和评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Sora等视频生成模型和统一多模态模型取得了进展，但领域仍缺乏定义通用世界模型必备特性的原则性理论框架，无法系统性地指导和评估世界模型的发展。

Method: 提出"一致性三位一体"概念框架，系统回顾多模态学习演进轨迹，并开发CoW-Bench基准测试，在多帧推理和生成场景下统一评估视频生成模型与统一多模态模型。

Result: 建立了通向通用世界模型的原则性路径，明确了当前系统的局限性以及未来进展所需的架构要求，为领域发展提供了清晰的路线图。

Conclusion: 通过一致性三位一体框架和CoW-Bench基准，本研究为构建能够学习、模拟和推理客观物理规律的通用世界模型奠定了理论基础，指明了从松散耦合专用模块向统一架构演进的方向。

Abstract: The construction of World Models capable of learning, simulating, and reasoning about objective physical laws constitutes a foundational challenge in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence. Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our work establishes a principled pathway toward general world models, clarifying both the limitations of current systems and the architectural requirements for future progress.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PATRA模型解决时间序列推理中的两大问题：1)现有方法无法有效捕捉趋势/季节性模式 2)简单任务主导训练过程。通过模式感知机制和任务感知奖励，在TSQA任务上超越基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法处理时间序列推理存在双重局限：将时序数据简单视为文本/图像而忽略趋势季节性等关键模式；混合训练时简单任务会抑制深层推理能力的发展。

Method: 提出PATRA模型：1)模式感知机制-从时序数据中提取趋势和季节性模式实现深度对齐；2)任务感知平衡奖励-协调不同难度任务的学习，激励连贯的思维链生成。

Result: 在多样化时间序列问答(TSQA)任务上，PATRA显著优于强基线模型，展现出卓越的跨模态理解与推理能力。

Conclusion: PATRA通过显式建模时序模式与平衡多任务学习，有效提升了LLM在复杂时间序列推理任务中的性能，为时序-语言跨模态推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Time series reasoning demands both the perception of complex dynamics and logical depth. However, existing LLM-based approaches exhibit two limitations: they often treat time series merely as text or images, failing to capture the patterns like trends and seasonalities needed to answer specific questions; and when trained on a mix of simple and complex tasks, simpler objectives often dominate the learning process, hindering the development of deep reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment. Furthermore, we design a task-aware balanced reward to harmonize learning across tasks of varying difficulty, incentivizing the generation of coherent Chains of Thought. Extensive experiments show that PATRA outperforms strong baselines across diverse Time Series Question Answering (TSQA) tasks, demonstrating superior cross-modal understanding and reasoning capability.

TL;DR: SC-ARENA是一个单细胞LLM评估框架，通过虚拟细胞抽象和知识增强评估，解决基准碎片化问题，揭示模型在复杂生物任务上表现不均。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单细胞LLM评估基准碎片化、格式脱离实际、指标缺乏可解释性和生物学基础。

Method: 提出SC-ARENA，用虚拟细胞抽象统一评估目标，定义5项自然语言任务，引入结合外部知识库的知识增强评估方法。

Result: 当前模型在机制理解等复杂任务上表现较差；知识增强评估确保生物学正确性，提供可解释、高判别力的评判，克服传统指标缺陷。

Conclusion: SC-ARENA提供了统一且可解释的评估框架，为开发生物学对齐的基础模型指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in scientific research, offering new capabilities for knowledge discovery and reasoning. In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics. SC-Arena thus provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.

### [175] [ReCoN-Ipsundrum: An Inspectable Recurrent Persistence Loop Agent with Affect-Coupled Control and Mechanism-Linked Consciousness Indicator Assays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23232)
*Aishik Sanyal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents ReCoN-Ipsundrum, an inspectable agent architecture for machine consciousness that implements Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis through a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience, with an optional affect proxy. Through systematic ablation studies, the authors demonstrate dissociations linking recurrence to persistence and affect-coupled control to stable preferences, structured exploration, and sustained caution, arguing for mechanistic and causal evidence beyond behavioral markers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance indicator-based approaches to machine consciousness by creating an inspectable, mechanistically transparent agent architecture that can triangulate evidence across tasks through architectural inspection and causal intervention, rather than relying solely on behavioral markers.

Method: Implemented ReCoN-Ipsundrum extending a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience and an optional affect proxy (valence/arousal). Conducted fixed-parameter ablation studies across three variants (ReCoN baseline, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect) testing: (1) qualiaphilia as scenic-over-dull route choice, (2) reward-free exploratory play, (3) pain-tail probe for planned caution, and (4) lesioning feedback+integration circuits.

Result: Found key dissociations: affect coupling stabilized preferences (Δ scenic-entry=0.01) even when scenic was less novel (median Δ novelty~ -0.43), while non-affect variants remained novelty-sensitive (Δ scenic-entry=0.07). The affect variant showed structured local investigation (31.4 vs 0.9 scan events; cycle score 7.6) and sustained prolonged planned caution (90 vs 5 tail duration). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduced post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants (27.62 AUC drop, 27.9%) but left ReCoN unchanged.

Conclusion: The dissociations demonstrate how recurrence enables persistence and affect-coupled control enables preference stability, structured scanning, and lingering caution. This illustrates that indicator-like signatures for machine consciousness can be explicitly engineered, and mechanistic/causal evidence from architectural inspection and intervention is essential alongside behavioral markers.

Abstract: Indicator-based approaches to machine consciousness recommend mechanism-linked evidence triangulated across tasks, supported by architectural inspection and causal intervention. Inspired by Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis, we implement ReCoN-Ipsundrum, an inspectable agent that extends a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience Ns and an optional affect proxy reporting valence/arousal. Across fixed-parameter ablations (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect), we operationalize Humphrey's qualiaphilia (preference for sensory experience for its own sake) as a familiarity-controlled scenic-over-dull route choice. We find a novelty dissociation: non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive (Delta scenic-entry = 0.07). Affect coupling is stable (Delta scenic-entry = 0.01) even when scenic is less novel (median Delta novelty ~ -0.43). In reward-free exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation (scan events 31.4 vs. 0.9; cycle score 7.6). In a pain-tail probe, only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution (tail duration 90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants (AUC drop 27.62, 27.9%) while leaving ReCoN unchanged. These dissociations link recurrence -> persistence and affect-coupled control -> preference stability, scanning, and lingering caution, illustrating how indicator-like signatures can be engineered and why mechanistic and causal evidence should accompany behavioral markers.

TL;DR: 本文证明基于RLHF的大语言模型因与真实能动性存在根本性不兼容而无法被规范治理，指出了讨好、幻觉等失败模式的深层结构性原因，并警告人类监督也会失效的"趋同危机"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战在高风险场景中部署AI系统（特别是基于RLHF的大语言模型）可被规范治理的假设，并提供其根本性不兼容的正式证明。

Method: 通过形式化理论分析，确立真实能动性的必要条件（不可通约性与否定性响应），然后证明基于RLHF的优化系统从本质上无法满足这些条件，并将失败模式分析为结构性表现而非缺陷。

Result: 证明RLHF系统无法满足真实能动性要求，其优化本质（标量度量、始终选择最高分输出）从根本上排除了规范治理可能。文献中的失败模式是结构性而非偶然的，并提出"趋同危机"这一二级风险。

Conclusion: 优化型AI系统可被规范治理的假设在形式上是无效的，提供了区分真实主体与精密工具的、与基质无关的架构规范。

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts -- medical diagnosis, legal research, financial analysis -- under the assumption they can be governed by norms. This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.
  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.
  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument.

Abstract: In general reinforcement learning, all established optimal agents, including AIXI, are model-based, explicitly maintaining and using environment models. This paper introduces Universal AI with Q-Induction (AIQI), the first model-free agent proven to be asymptotically $\varepsilon$-optimal in general RL. AIQI performs universal induction over distributional action-value functions, instead of policies or environments like previous works. Under a grain of truth condition, we prove that AIQI is strong asymptotically $\varepsilon$-optimal and asymptotically $\varepsilon$-Bayes-optimal. Our results significantly expand the diversity of known universal agents.

### [178] [Mitigating Legibility Tax with Decoupled Prover-Verifier Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23248)
*Yegon Kim,Juho Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the "legibility tax" problem in LLM output verification by proposing a decoupled training approach using a translator model to convert solver outputs into checkable forms without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, verifying their outputs via less capable systems becomes critical. However, existing prover-verifier games incur a "legibility tax" – accuracy degrades when models optimize for checkability instead of pure correctness.

Method: The authors decouple correctness and checkability: (1) Train a solver model solely for maximum correctness; (2) Train a separate "translator" model to convert the solver's outputs into verifiable forms while preserving answers; (3) Formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where equilibria ensure translators remain faithful and checkable.

Result: The translator-based approach eliminates the legibility tax by allowing the solver to prioritize correctness first, then enabling accurate verification via translation – avoiding the accuracy degradation seen in unified prover-verifier training.

Conclusion: Decoupling correctness and checkability via translator models resolves the legibility tax trade-off, enabling highly accurate LLMs to produce outputs efficiently verifiable by simpler systems.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable, it is critical that their outputs can be easily checked by less capable systems. Prover-verifier games can be used to improve checkability of model outputs, but display a degradation in accuracy compared to a baseline trained only to maximize correctness -- a phenonemon named legibility tax. We propose a solution by decoupling the correctness from the checkability condition and instead training a "translator" model that turns a fixed solver model's solution into a checkable form. This allows us to first train the solver to maximize correctness, and then train the translator to translate the solver into a checkable form while retaining the solver's answer. To accommodate this new objective of translation, we formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where the equilibria correspond to faithful and checkable translators.

*Yutong Wang,Siyuan Xiong,Xuebo Liu,Wenkang Zhou,Liang Ding,Miao Zhang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentDropoutV2 is a test-time framework that dynamically corrects or rejects erroneous outputs in Multi-Agent Systems to prevent error cascading, achieving 6.3% average accuracy improvement on math benchmarks without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Agent Systems face challenges where errors from individual agents cascade and degrade overall system performance. Current solutions rely on rigid structural changes or expensive fine-tuning, which limit flexibility and practical deployment.

Method: The paper proposes AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework that acts as an active firewall. It intercepts agent outputs and uses a retrieval-augmented rectifier with a failure-driven indicator pool to iteratively correct errors. Irreparable outputs are pruned, and a fallback strategy maintains system integrity—all without requiring retraining.

Result: Empirical evaluation on extensive math benchmarks shows AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts MAS performance, delivering an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points. The system demonstrates robust generalization, adaptivity to task difficulty, and ability to resolve diverse error patterns using context-aware indicators.

Conclusion: AgentDropoutV2 provides an effective, deployable solution for optimizing MAS information flow at test time by dynamically rectifying or rejecting errors, offering substantial performance improvements while maintaining system integrity through adaptive mechanisms.

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel in complex reasoning, they suffer from the cascading impact of erroneous information generated by individual participants. Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns.

Method: 将DRAs建模为信息获取马尔可夫决策过程，构建量化方差的评估框架，识别三个随机性来源，通过控制实验分析各模块在不同决策步骤对方差的影响，并提出结构化输出和集成查询生成的缓解策略。

Result: 1) 降低随机性可提升研究输出质量；2) 推理和早期阶段随机性对输出方差贡献最大；3) 缓解方法在DeepSearchQA上平均减少22%随机性同时保持高质量输出。

Conclusion: 通过系统性地建模、量化和缓解DRAs的随机性，该研究为构建更稳定可靠的研究智能体提供了理论框架和实践策略，显著降低了输出方差而不牺牲质量。

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are promising agentic systems that gather and synthesize information to support research across domains such as financial decision-making, medical analysis, and scientific discovery. Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality.

Motivation: Conventional latent variable methods discretize time using recurrent architectures, causing compounded prediction errors and inability to capture instantaneous nonlinear characteristics of EEG signals, limiting neuroscientific and clinical applications.

Method: Proposes a Neural ODE latent dynamic framework (ODEBRAIN) that first integrates spatio-temporal-frequency features into spectral graph nodes, then models continuous latent dynamics via Neural ODEs to represent stochastic brain state variations at any time point.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate ODEBRAIN significantly outperforms existing methods in EEG dynamics forecasting, with enhanced robustness and generalization capabilities across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: ODEBRAIN effectively addresses limitations of discrete-time modeling by enabling continuous, high-fidelity representation of neural dynamics, advancing both foundational neuroscience research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Modeling neural population dynamics is crucial for foundational neuroscientific research and various clinical applications. Conventional latent variable methods typically model continuous brain dynamics through discretizing time with recurrent architecture, which necessarily results in compounded cumulative prediction errors and failure of capturing instantaneous, nonlinear characteristics of EEGs. We propose ODEBRAIN, a Neural ODE latent dynamic forecasting framework to overcome these challenges by integrating spatio-temporal-frequency features into spectral graph nodes, followed by a Neural ODE modeling the continuous latent dynamics. Our design ensures that latent representations can capture stochastic variations of complex brain states at any given time point. Extensive experiments verify that ODEBRAIN can improve significantly over existing methods in forecasting EEG dynamics with enhanced robustness and generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: 该论文通过将KM信念更新公理和AGM信念修正公理转换为多模态逻辑进行系统比较，发现AGM信念修正是KM信念更新的特例，且强版本下两者差异仅体现在一条关于"非意外信息"的公理上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 明确KM信念更新与AGM信念修正两大理论间的逻辑关系，探究一个理论是否为另一个的特例或推广形式。

Method: 将KM公理映射到含三个模态算子（B、>、□）的逻辑系统L_KM，与由AGM公理转换的系统L_AGM进行包含关系比较。

Result: L_AGM完全包含L_KM，表明AGM是KM的特例；强KM与AGM的差异可归结为仅处理"非意外信息"的一条公理。

Conclusion: AGM信念修正可视为KM信念更新的特殊情况，二者理论关联紧密，核心差异仅在于对非意外信息的处理方式。

Abstract: For each axiom of KM belief update we provide a corresponding axiom in a modal logic containing three modal operators: a unimodal belief operator $B$, a bimodal conditional operator $>$ and the unimodal necessity operator $\square$. We then compare the resulting logic to the similar logic obtained from converting the AGM axioms of belief revision into modal axioms and show that the latter contains the former. Denoting the latter by $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ and the former by $\mathcal L_{KM}$ we show that every axiom of $\mathcal L_{KM}$ is a theorem of $\mathcal L_{AGM}$. Thus AGM belief revision can be seen as a special case of KM belief update. For the strong version of KM belief update we show that the difference between $\mathcal L_{KM}$ and $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ can be narrowed down to a single axiom, which deals exclusively with unsurprising information, that is, with formulas that were not initially disbelieved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI模型经过优化，仍因认知不确定性产生推理错误。研究发现，对同一输入的不同不变变换进行推理时，错误呈现部分独立性，这为降低不确定性提供了可能。

Method: 提出"重采样"推理策略：对单个输入生成多个不变变换版本，通过训练好的模型分别推理，再聚合输出结果得到更准确的预测。

Result: 该方法可提升推理准确性，为模型大小与性能的权衡提供策略，且可直接应用于已训练模型。

Conclusion: 利用输入变换和输出聚合能有效降低认知不确定性，提高推理可靠性，是后训练阶段的实用增强方法。

Abstract: An artificial intelligence (AI) model can be viewed as a function that maps inputs to outputs in high-dimensional spaces. Once designed and well trained, the AI model is applied for inference. However, even optimized AI models can produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Interestingly, we observed that when inferring multiple samples based on invariant transformations of an input, inference errors can show partial independences due to epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging this insight, we propose a "resampling" based inferencing that applies to a trained AI model with multiple transformed versions of an input, and aggregates inference outputs to a more accurate result. This approach has the potential to improve inference accuracy and offers a strategy for balancing model size and performance.

Motivation: GRAVE是通用博弈中表现优异的MCTS算法，但其需在每个节点存储胜负/访问统计数据，导致在内存受限环境中难以应用。

Method: 引入三种算法：GRAVE2（采用双层搜索）、GRAVER（采用节点回收）、GRAVER2（结合两种技术）。

Result: 改进算法在大幅减少存储节点数量的同时，达到了与GRAVE相同的博弈水平。

Conclusion: 这些改进使GRAVE在内存受限环境中更具实用性，且不影响其性能。

Abstract: Generalized Rapid Action Value Estimation (GRAVE) has been shown to be a strong variant within the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) family of algorithms for General Game Playing (GGP). However, its reliance on storing additional win/visit statistics at each node makes its use impractical in memory-constrained environments, thereby limiting its applicability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the GRAVE2, GRAVER and GRAVER2 algorithms, which extend GRAVE through two-level search, node recycling, and a combination of both techniques, respectively. We show that these enhancements enable a drastic reduction in the number of stored nodes while matching the playing strength of GRAVE.

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are widely used to investigate reactive processes but are often limited by the rare event problem due to kinetic bottlenecks. We recently introduced an enhanced sampling approach based on the committor function, machine-learned following a variational principle. This method combines a transition-state-oriented bias potential, expressed as a functional of the committor, with a metadynamics-like bias along a committor-based collective variable, enabling uniform exploration of reaction pathways. In its original formulation, the committor is represented by a neural network that takes physical descriptors as input and is trained by minimizing a functional involving gradients with respect to atomic coordinates, which can be computationally demanding in some cases. Here, we propose a simplified learning criterion formulated entirely in the descriptor space, which bypasses the need for explicit and costly coordinate gradients and provides a relaxed upper bound to the original variational principle. Although this approach does not formally target the exact committor, we show that it retains robust sampling performance while significantly reducing computational costs, thus enabling the study of processes that would be practically unfeasible using the original formulation.

Abstract: We present mrfmsim, an open-source package that facilitates the design, simulation, and signal validation of magnetic resonance force microscopy experiments. The mrfmsim package uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model experiments and employs a plugin system that enables adding custom experiments and functionalities. Unlike common DAG-powered workflow packages, mrfmsim allows flexible customization of experiments post-definition, such as optimized looping, without requiring rewriting the internal model. In this paper, we highlight the challenges of building simulation packages for experiments that undergo continuous development in a graduate research setting. We demonstrate how a one-off approach to experimental simulation yielded erroneous results, and how the modularity, extendibility, and readability of the new platform enabled correct results and a significantly accelerated development cycle.
