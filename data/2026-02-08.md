Abstract: The study by Jung et al. (Jung H, Covino R, Arjun A, et al., Nat Comput Sci. 3:334-345 (2023)) introduced Artificial Intelligence for Molecular Mechanism Discovery (AIMMD), a novel sampling algorithm that integrates machine learning to enhance the efficiency of transition path sampling (TPS). By enabling on-the-fly estimation of the committor probability and simultaneously deriving a human-interpretable reaction coordinate, AIMMD offers a robust framework for elucidating the mechanistic pathways of complex molecular processes. This commentary provides a discussion and critical analysis of the core AIMMD framework, explores its recent extensions, and offers an assessment of the method's potential impact and limitations.

*Junwoo Gim,Jun Heo,Weng Cho Chew,Dong-Yeop Na*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: 红外透明被动辐射制冷需考虑全角度不对称性而非仅垂直入射角，否则会高估实际冷却性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究过度强调垂直入射角的红外不对称传输，但实际应用中需评估半球空间内所有角度的辐射热交换，单角度模型无法准确预测非接触式制冷效果。

Method: 建立角度分辨全波电磁模型（采用布洛赫周期边界条件和Floquet模式分解），计算周期性结构波长/角度依赖的双向反射透射特性，并耦合能量平衡热模型预测物体瞬态温度演化。

Result: 垂直入射的强不对称性在斜射角下显著减弱，全角度积分模型显示实际冷却效果微弱甚至产生加热效应，而单角度模型严重高估制冷性能。

Conclusion: 红外透明辐射制冷器件的电磁设计核心应是角向分布式不对称透明度，该原则同样适用于广角不对称超表面开发。

Abstract: Infrared (IR)-transparent passive radiative cooling (PRC) enables non-contact thermal management by regulating radiative heat exchange without direct attachment to the cooling object. While asymmetric IR transmission at a specific incidence angle -- typically normal incidence -- is often emphasized, we show that such single-angle asymmetry is neither sufficient nor predictive of practical cooling performance. In this work, we demonstrate that effective non-contact PRC requires angularly distributed asymmetric IR transparency evaluated through hemispherical integration over emission directions, rather than asymmetry at a single incidence angle. To quantify this effect, an angle-resolved full-wave electromagnetic (EM) model with Bloch periodic boundary conditions and Floquet mode decomposition is employed to compute wavelength- and angle-dependent bidirectional reflection and transmission of periodic PRC structures. The resulting EM response is coupled to an energy-balance-based thermal model to predict the transient temperature evolution of the cooling object. By comparing models that account for the full angular distribution with normal-incidence-only approximations, we show that pronounced asymmetric transmission at normal incidence is generally not preserved at oblique angles. As a result, angular integration yields only marginal cooling or may even result in net heating, whereas normal-incidence-based models can substantially overestimate cooling performance. These results establish angularly distributed asymmetric transparency as a key EM design principle for IR-transparent PRC and wide-angle asymmetric metasurfaces.

Conclusion: 该理论框架在近连续区气体松弛预测中具有优势，新型Rykov模型比传统模型更完整描述能量交换过程，基准测试验证其精度。

Abstract: The collision phenomenon of polyatomic gases is described by the collision operator of extended Boltzmann equation or the energy-exchange model in particle direct simulations, for example, the Borgnakke-Larsen model. However, as a collision kernel, it dose not guarantee the entrinsic detailed balance and is not integrable. In this work, the Pullin equation, which possesses an integrable collision kernel and satisfies the detailed balance constraint, is adopted as an extended Boltzmann equation for the theoretical analysis of near-continuum relaxation mechanisms. For clarity, only the translational and rotational degrees are considered in this work. Explicit analytical expressions for the temporal relaxation of macroscopic variables, including the stress force, (translational/rotational) temperature and heat flux, are obtained at the first time. This is achieved by approximating the distribution function in mixed Hermite and Laguerre for rotation and computing the collision operator moments, enabling a direct description of macroscopic non-equilibrium evolution. Base on the same elementary moment (integral) of collision operator, the macroscopic transport coefficients is found in Chapman-Enskog framework. The long-standing speculation, that thermal conduction coefficient should be depended on the degrees of thermal non-equilibrium, is rigorously confirmed and evaluated. When thermal equilibrium is enforced, the present thermal conduction coefficients can be degenerated to the famous results of Mason and Monchick. Given the correct relaxation rate, a Rykov-type novel relaxation model for Pullin equation is proposed. It can recover the interaction of transaltional and rotatioanl heat fluxes in relaxation process, which is ignored in the widely used Rykov equation. Finally, the precision of this new Rykov-type equation is examined using a series of benchmark test cases.

### [4] [Certifiable Boolean Reasoning Is Universal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05120)
*Wenhao Li,Anastasis Kratsios,Hrad Ghoukasian,Dennis Zvigelsky*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning architecture that certifiably reasons through all Boolean tasks by parameterizing distributions over valid Boolean circuits, with theoretical universality guarantees and empirical success where standard MLPs fail structural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between theoretical existence of neural networks that can emulate any Boolean circuit and practical trained models failing to achieve certified, universal reasoning capabilities for Boolean tasks.

Method: A novel deep learning architecture that parameterizes distributions over Boolean circuits, ensuring every parameter configuration almost surely produces a valid circuit (providing intrinsic certification), with proven universality for arbitrary Boolean functions.

Result: 1) Universality theorem: For any Boolean function f, exists parameter configuration making sampled circuit compute f with arbitrarily high probability; 2) For O(log B)-juntas, parameters scale linearly with input dimension B; 3) Empirical exact-match accuracy on truth-table completion with 100% Boolean-valued internal units, unlike MLP baselines (only ~10% Boolean units).

Conclusion: The proposed architecture achieves the first certifiable universal Boolean reasoner that both theoretically guarantees circuit validity for all parameters and empirically maintains structural constraints (Boolean-valued units) while solving arbitrary Boolean tasks, outperforming conventional approaches in interpretability.

Abstract: The proliferation of agentic systems has thrust the reasoning capabilities of AI into the forefront of contemporary machine learning. While it is known that there \emph{exist} neural networks which can reason through any Boolean task $f:\{0,1\}^B\to\{0,1\}$, in the sense that they emulate Boolean circuits with fan-in $2$ and fan-out $1$ gates, trained models have been repeatedly demonstrated to fall short of these theoretical ideals. This raises the question: \textit{Can one exhibit a deep learning model which \textbf{certifiably} always reasons and can \textbf{universally} reason through any Boolean task?} Moreover, such a model should ideally require few parameters to solve simple Boolean tasks.
  We answer this question affirmatively by exhibiting a deep learning architecture which parameterizes distributions over Boolean circuits with the guarantee that, for every parameter configuration, a sample is almost surely a valid Boolean circuit (and hence admits an intrinsic circuit-level certificate). We then prove a universality theorem: for any Boolean $f:\{0,1\}^B\to\{0,1\}$, there exists a parameter configuration under which the sampled circuit computes $f$ with arbitrarily high probability. When $f$ is an $\mathcal{O}(\log B)$-junta, the required number of parameters scales linearly with the input dimension $B$.
  Empirically, on a controlled truth-table completion benchmark aligned with our setting, the proposed architecture trains reliably and achieves high exact-match accuracy while preserving the predicted structure: every internal unit is Boolean-valued on $\{0,1\}^B$. Matched MLP baselines reach comparable accuracy, but only about $10\%$ of hidden units admit a Boolean representation; i.e.\ are two-valued over the Boolean cube.

### [5] [Challenges in Solving Sequence-to-Graph Alignment with Co-Linear Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05186)
*Xingfu Li*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: 该研究发现向序列-图比对模型中添加共线性结构约束无法降低计算复杂度，两种新问题在特定条件下仍保持高计算难度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究序列-图比对中引入共线性结构是否能简化计算，解决生物序列比对中遗传变异捕获的效率瓶颈

Method: 提出Gap-SCLC和Edit-CLC两种新计算问题，通过强指数时间假说(SETH)和NP-hardness理论证明计算复杂度

Result: Gap-SCLC问题在二元字母表下无法突破二次时间复杂度(除非SETH不成立)；Edit-CLC问题在图含错时具有NP难特性

Conclusion: 共线性结构信息无法降低序列-图比对模型的计算复杂度，这些模型至少与无结构约束的模型同等困难

Abstract: Sequence alignment is a cornerstone technique in computational biology for assessing similarities and differences among biological sequences. A key variant, sequence-to-graph alignment, plays a crucial role in effectively capturing genetic variations. In this work, we introduce two novel formulations within this framework: the Gap-Sensitive Co-Linear Chaining (Gap-CLC) problem and the Co-Linear Chaining with Errors based on Edit Distance (Edit-CLC) problem, and we investigate their computational complexity. We show that solving the Gap-CLC problem in sub-quadratic time is highly unlikely unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) fails -- even when restricted to binary alphabets. Furthermore, we establish that the Edit-CLC problem is NP-hard in the presence of errors within the graph. These findings emphasize that incorporating co-linear structures into sequence-to-graph alignment models fails to reduce computational complexity, highlighting that these models remain at least as computationally challenging to solve as those lacking such prior information.
