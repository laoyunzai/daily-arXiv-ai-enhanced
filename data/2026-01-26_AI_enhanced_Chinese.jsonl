The binodal densities are not solely determined by a bulk (effective) free energy, but also affected by gradient terms, while capillary waves and Ostwald processes are determined by three distinct interfacial tensions. These and related phenomena were so far explained at continuum level using a top-down minimal theory (Active Model B+). This theory, by Taylor-expanding in the scalar order parameter (or density), effectively assumes that phase separation is weak, which is not true across most of the phase diagram. Here we develop a quantitative account of active phase separation, by introducing an active counterpart of Cahn-Hilliard theory, constructing the density current from all possible terms with up to four spatial derivatives without Taylor-expanding in the density. From this O(grad^4) theory, we show how to compute binodals and interfacial tensions for arbitrary choices of the five density-dependent 'coefficient functions' that specify the theory (replacing the four constant coefficients of Active Model B+). We further consider a particle model composed of thermal quorum-sensing active particles (tQSAPs) yielding a fully specified example of the O(grad^4) theory upon coarse-graining. We find that to coarse-grain consistently at O(grad^4) requires a novel procedure, based on multiple-scale analysis, to systematically eliminate fast-evolving orientational moments. Using this, we calculate from microscopic physics all five coefficient functions of the active Cahn-Hilliard theory for tQSAPs. We identify contributions that were missed in previous continuum theories, and show how neglecting them becomes justified only in the limit of large quorum-sensing range parameter.

This phenomenon is known as rate-induced tipping and has been reported in a variety of systems, from simple ordinary differential equations and maps to mathematical models in climate sciences and ecology. In most examples, the transition happens at a critical rate of parameter change, a rate-induced tipping point, and is associated with a simple unstable orbit (edge state). In this work, we show how this simple picture changes when non-attracting fractal sets exist in the autonomous system, a ubiquitous situation in non-linear dynamics. We show that these fractals in phase space induce fractals in parameter space, which control the rates and parameter changes that result in tipping. We explain how such rate-induced fractals appear and how the fractal dimensions of the different sets are related to each other.

These one-dimensional fermionic (QSSEP) and bosonic (QSSIP) models feature stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping driven by Brownian noise, together with boundary injection and removal processes. They provide solvable microscopic settings in which quantum coherence coexists with diffusion. Upon noise averaging, their dynamics reduce to those of the classical SSEP/SSIP. We show that the cumulant generating function of the integrated current, at large scales, obeys a large deviation principle. To leading order in system size and for each noise realization, it converges to that of the corresponding classical process, establishing a classical typicality of current fluctuations in these noisy quantum systems. We further demonstrate a direct connection with Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (MFT), showing that the large-scale equations satisfied by biased quantum densities coincide with the steady-state Hamilton equations of MFT, thereby providing a microscopic quantum justification of the MFT framework in these models. Finally, we identify the leading finite-size corrections to the current statistics. We show the existence of subleading contributions of purely quantum origin, which are absent in the corresponding classical setting, and provide their explicit expressions for the second and third current cumulants. These quantum corrections are amenable to direct experimental or numerical verification, provided sufficient control over the noise realizations can be achieved.

The versatility and scalability of QCAs offers compelling routes for scaling quantum information systems with global controls, as well as new perspectives on quantum many-body dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u7269\u79cd\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u539f\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5143\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u5176\u76f8\u5e72\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u5143\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u9635\u5217\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u94f7\u548c\u94ef\u53cc\u7269\u79cd\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u539f\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u5143\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u6267\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u8109\u51b2\u5e8f\u5217\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5305\u62ec96.7%\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\u300117\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7c07\u6001\u3001\u9ad8\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u56fe\u6001\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u5143\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u5177\u6709\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify entanglement as the key resource that enables local random unitaries to generate global random states by effectively gluing randomness across the system. Specifically, we demonstrate that approximate random states can be produced from an entangled state $|\u03c8\\rangle$ through the application of local random unitaries. We show that the resulting ensemble forms an approximate state design with an error saturating as $\u0398(e^{-\\mathcal{N}_2(\u03c8)})$, where $\\mathcal{N}_2(\u03c8)$ is the second R\u00e9nyi entanglement entropy of $|\u03c8\\rangle$. Furthermore, we prove that this tight bound also applies to the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of coherence when the ensemble is constructed using coherence-free operations. These results imply that, when restricted to resource-free gates, the quality of the generated random states is determined entirely by the resource content of the initial state. Notably, we find that among all $\u03b1$-R\u00e9nyi entropeis, the second R\u00e9nyi entropy yields the tightest bounds. Consequently, these second R\u00e9nyi entropies can be interpreted as the maximal capacities for generating randomness using resource-free operations. Finally, moving beyond approximate state designs, we utilize this entanglement-assisted gluing mechanism to present a novel method for generating pseudorandom states in multipartite systems from a locally entangled state via pseudorandom unitaries in each of parties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u7ea0\u7f20\u662f\u5c40\u90e8\u968f\u673a\u9149\u64cd\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u968f\u673a\u6001\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u7531\u7b2c\u4e8cR\u00e9nyi\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u4f53\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u6001\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u968f\u673a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u968f\u673a\u6027\"\u7c98\u5408\"\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u968f\u673a\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001|\u03c8\u27e9\u7ecf\u5c40\u90e8\u968f\u673a\u9149\u64cd\u4f5c\u540e\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7cfb\u7efc\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5176\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e8cR\u00e9nyi\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5N\u2082(\u03c8)\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u65e0\u76f8\u5e72\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u591a\u4f53\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u9149\u64cd\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7cfb\u7efc\u5f62\u6210\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6001\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u7cbe\u786e\u4e3a\u0398(e^(-N\u2082(\u03c8)))\uff1b\u8be5\u754c\u9650\u540c\u6837\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e8cR\u00e9nyi\u76f8\u5e72\u71b5\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8cR\u00e9nyi\u71b5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u03b1-R\u00e9nyi\u71b5\u4e2d\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u7d27\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u65e0\u5173\u64cd\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ea0\u7f20\u662f\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u968f\u673a\u6001\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8cR\u00e9nyi\u71b5\u4e3a\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u6001\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}

While the Kondo effect has traditionally been understood to suppress magnetism through the formation of local singlets, recent studies suggest that Kondo interactions may enhance magnetic order under certain conditions. However, these scenarios often rely on complex electronic structures, including orbital and charge degrees of freedom, making the essential mechanisms difficult to isolate. Here we report the realization of a spin-(1/2,1) Kondo necklace model in a Ni-based complex-a minimal spin-only analog of the Kondo lattice that isolates quantum spin correlations by eliminating charge degrees of freedom. Thermodynamic measurements identify a magnetic phase transition and a field-induced quantum phase transition. Perturbative analysis reveals that the Kondo coupling mediates effective antiferromagnetic interactions between the spin-1 sites, stabilizing the N\u00e9el order across the entire chain.

Beyond evaluation, DSGym enables agent training via execution-verified data synthesis pipeline. As a case study, we build a 2,000-example training set and trained a 4B model in DSGym that outperforms GPT-4o on standardized analysis benchmarks.

Realistic modeling of such dynamics necessitates taking into account various charge and energy transfer channels involving the coupling of nuclear motion with a very large number of electronic states, leading to prohibitive cost using classical computational methods. In this work we introduce a generalization of the Anderson-Newns Hamiltonian and develop a highly optimized quantum algorithm for simulating the non-adiabatic dynamics of realistic molecule-metal interfaces. Using the PennyLane software platform, we perform resource estimations of our algorithm, showing its remarkably low implementation cost for model systems representative of various scientifically and industrially relevant molecule-metal systems. Specifically, we find that time evolution for models including $100$ metal orbitals, $8$ molecular orbitals, and $20$ nuclear degrees of freedom, requires only $271$ qubits and $7.9 \\times 10^7$ Toffoli gates for $1000$ Trotter steps, suggesting non-adiabatic molecule-metal dynamics as a fruitful application of first-generation fault-tolerant quantum computers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u5b50-\u91d1\u5c5e\u754c\u9762\u975e\u7edd\u70ed\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5e7fAnderson-Newns\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5728\u5305\u542b100\u4e2a\u91d1\u5c5e\u8f68\u9053\u30018\u4e2a\u5206\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u548c20\u4e2a\u6838\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ec5\u9700271\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u8fd1\u7aef\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50-\u91d1\u5c5e\u754c\u9762\u7684\u975e\u7edd\u70ed\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u591a\u76f8\u50ac\u5316\u3001\u67d3\u6599\u654f\u5316\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u7535\u6c60\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u6362\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u7535\u8377\u4f20\u8f93\uff09\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u9700\u8026\u5408\u5927\u91cf\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u4e0e\u6838\u8fd0\u52a8\u800c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u4f53\u7cfb\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86Anderson-Newns\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8ePennyLane\u5e73\u53f0\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u975e\u7edd\u70ed\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d44\u6e90\u4f30\u7b97\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u5305\u542b100\u4e2a\u91d1\u5c5e\u8f68\u9053\u30018\u4e2a\u5206\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u548c20\u4e2a\u6838\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u6a21\u62df1000\u4e2aTrotter\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u4ec5\u9700271\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u548c7.9 \u00d7 10^7\u4e2aToffoli\u95e8\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9884\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u975e\u7edd\u70ed\u5206\u5b50-\u91d1\u5c5e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4ee3\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an \"expert bottleneck\" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation.

However, each DMFT step is computationally demanding, and many iterations can be required to achieve convergence. Here, we accelerate the convergence of DMFT by initializing its self-consistent cycle with solutions from computationally cheaper and more approximate methods. We compare the initialization with the non-interacting solution to a range of quantum embedding compatible approaches: Hartree-Fock, the Hubbard-I approximation, rotationally invariant slave bosons (RISB), and its ghost extension (g-RISB). We find that these initializations can reduce the number of DMFT iterations by up to an order of magnitude, with g-RISB providing the most effective and reliable benefits. In most regimes, initializing with g-RISB and performing a single DMFT iteration suffices to recover the full dynamical structure. The improvement in convergence is controlled by the initial solution's accuracy in the low-energy part of the self-energy, on the scale of the non-interacting bandwidth. This strategy is especially effective at the Mott insulator-metal transition, where an initialization from the non-interacting limit can lead to a breakdown of DMFT due to the sign problem.

The upper-level decision variable parameterizes the reward of the lower-level MDP, and the upper-level objective depends on the optimal induced policy. Existing methods for bi-level optimization and RL often require second-order information, impose strong regularization at the lower level, or inefficiently use samples through nested-loop procedures. In this work, we propose a single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm that optimizes the bi-level objective via a penalty-based reformulation. We introduce into the lower-level RL objective an attenuating entropy regularization, which enables asymptotically unbiased upper-level hyper-gradient estimation without solving the unregularized RL problem exactly. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point of the original, unregularized bi-level optimization problem through a novel lower-level residual analysis under a special type of Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. We validate the performance of our method through experiments on a GridWorld goal position problem and on happy tweet generation through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u56de\u8def\u4e00\u9636\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8870\u51cf\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u504f\u9ad8\u9636\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Polyak-Lojasiewicz\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9a7b\u70b9", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9700\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5f3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6216\u5d4c\u5957\u5faa\u73af\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u5c42\u53d8\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0b\u5c42MDP\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u573a\u666f", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5355\u56de\u8def\u4e00\u9636\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u60e9\u7f5a\u91cd\u6784\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728RL\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8870\u51cf\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u672a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fd1\u65e0\u504f\u7684\u8d85\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1", "result": "\u5728\u7279\u6b8aPolyak-Lojasiewicz\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e0b\u5c42\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u672a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53cc\u5c42\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u9a7b\u70b9", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u6548\uff0cGridWorld\u4e0eRLHF\u751f\u6210\u5feb\u4e50\u63a8\u6587\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

In this strongly confined geometry, atomic coherence is profoundly influenced by wall-induced relaxation arising from frequent atom-surface collisions. By analyzing both absorption and fluorescence spectra, we demonstrate that the optical response is dominated by a closed cycling transition, which effectively isolates the atomic dynamics to a two-level configuration despite the presence of multiple hyperfine states.

This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option.

In this work, we derive and analytically solve the low-energy Kondo theories for SVAIM at half-filling, with especial focus on the two anti-Hund's regimes: the impurity is either dominated by a valley doublet, or a trivial singlet. In the doublet regime, we reveal that a novel pair Kondo scattering $\u03bb_x$ is required to flip the valley doublet, which involves a quartic operator of bath electrons. Our renormalization group (RG) calculation based on the Coulomb gas analog shows $\u03bb_x$ drives a phase transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. One side of the transition is an anisotropic doublet phase, characterized by non-universal phase shifts of bath electrons and non-analytic impurity susceptibilities, while the other is a Fermi liquid formed by pair-Kondo resonance. The finite-size many-body spectrum, thermodynamic quantities, and correlation functions for both phases are analytically solved. Remarkably, the solution in the pair-Kondo Fermi liquid is achieved via the constructive approach of bosonization-refermionization along a solvable fixed line, where the many-body interaction $\u03bb_x$ is mapped into a pseudo-fermion bilinear in a rigorous manner.

Extreme class imbalance biases conventional models toward majority-class predictions, limiting recall, calibration, and operational usefulness. We propose LPCORP (Low-Prevalence CORrector for Prediction)*, a two-stage framework that combines reasoningenhanced prediction with confidence-based outcome correction. A reasoning model first produces enriched predictions from narrative inputs, after which a lightweight logistic-regression classifier evaluates and selectively corrects these outputs to mitigate prevalence-driven bias. We evaluate LPCORP on real-world datasets from medical and consumer service domains. The results show that this method transforms a highly imbalanced setting into a well-balanced one while preserving the original number of samples and without applying any resampling strategies. Test-set evaluation demonstrates substantially improved performance, particularly in precision, which is a known weakness in low-prevalence data. We further provide a costreduction analysis comparing the expenses associated with rare-event damage control without preventive measures to those incurred when low-cost, prediction-based preventive interventions are applied that showed more than 50% reduction in some cases. * Patent pending: U.S. Provisional 63/933,518, filed 8 December 2025.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLPCORP\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u9886\u57df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u800c\u504f\u5411\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u6821\u6b63\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6d41\u884c\u7387\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9884\u9632\u5e72\u9884\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc750%\u3002", "conclusion": "LPCORP\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7ea6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In particular, quantum thermodynamical protocols for cooling can be significantly affected, potentially altering both their performance and efficiency. Analytically characterizing the impact of such errors becomes increasingly challenging as the system size grows, particularly in deep quantum circuits where noise can accumulate in complex ways. To address this, we introduce a general framework for approximating the cumulative effect of gate-dependent noise using a global depolarizing channel. We specify the regime in which this approximation provides a reliable description of the noisy dynamics. Applying our framework to the thermodynamical two-sort algorithmic cooling (TSAC) protocol, we analytically derive its asymptotic cooling limit in the presence of noise. Using the cooling limit, the optimal cooling performance is achieved by a finite number of qubits--distinguished from the conventional noiseless TSAC protocol by an infinite number of qubits--and fundamental bounds on the achievable ground-state population are derived.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Intrinsic randomness is generated when a quantum state is measured in any basis in which it is not diagonal. In an adversarial scenario, we quantify this randomness by the probability that a correlated eavesdropper could correctly guess the measurement outcomes. What if the eavesdropper is never wrong, but can sometimes return an inconclusive outcome? Inspired by analogous concepts in quantum state discrimination, we introduce the unambiguous randomness of a quantum state and measurement, and, relaxing the assumption of perfect accuracy, randomness with a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes. We solve these problems for any state and projective measurement in dimension two, as well as for an isotropically noisy state measured in an unbiased basis of any dimension. In the latter case, we find that, given a fixed amount of total noise, an eavesdropper correlated only to the noisy state is always outperformed by an eavesdropper with joint correlations to both a noisy state and a noisy measurement. In fact, we identify a critical error parameter beyond which the joint eavesdropper achieves perfect guessing probability, ruling out any possibility of private randomness.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces \"unambiguous randomness\" to quantify quantum measurement randomness against eavesdroppers who may return inconclusive outcomes (not just wrong guesses).

LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7f8e\u56e2\u53d1\u5e035600\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u6e90MoE\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578bLongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u73af\u5883\u6269\u5c55\u3001DORA\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u548cHeavy Thinking\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u5907\u5353\u8d8a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u957f\u5c3e\u751f\u6210\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5e76\u884c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u3001\u73af\u5883\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff1b\u6269\u5c55DORA\u652f\u6301\u4e07\u7ea7\u591a\u73af\u5883\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u771f\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Heavy Thinking\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578bSOTA\uff1b\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u5c55\u73b0\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5728\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u521b\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5176\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A 0.2nm titanium film, deposited atop pre-sputtered \u03b1-tantalum, acts as a solid-state oxygen getter that chemically modifies the native Ta oxide at the metal-air interface. After device fabrication, the titanium layer is removed using buffered oxide etchant, leaving behind a chemically reduced Ta oxide surface. Subsequent high-vacuum annealing further suppresses two-level system loss. Resonators treated with this process exhibit internal quality factors Qi exceeding an average of 1.5 million in the single-photon regime across ten devices, over three times higher than otherwise identical devices lacking the titanium layer. These results highlight the critical role of interfacial oxide chemistry in superconducting loss and reinforce atomic-scale surface engineering as an effective approach to improving coherence in tantalum-based quantum circuits.

While Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled, information-based framework that integrates experimental planning with probabilistic inference, the selection of utility functions in BED is a long-standing and active topic, where different criteria emphasize different notions of information. Although Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence has been one of the most common choices, recent studies have proposed Wasserstein distance as an alternative. In this work, we first employ a toy example to illustrate an issue of Wasserstein distance - the value of Wasserstein distance of a fixed-shape posterior depends on the relative position of its main mass within the support and can exhibit false rewards unrelated to information gain, especially with a non-informative prior (e.g., uniform distribution). We then further provide a systematic comparison between these two criteria through a classical source inversion problem in the BED literature, revealing that the KL divergence tends to lead to faster convergence in the absence of model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics provide more robust sequential BED results if model discrepancy is non-negligible. These findings clarify the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics for the utility function and provide guidelines for selecting suitable criteria in practical BED applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2dKL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5728\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u800cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u65f6\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4e14Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1(BED)\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\uff0cKL\u6563\u5ea6\u662f\u5e38\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u4f46Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u73a9\u5177\u793a\u4f8b\u63ed\u793aWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u6e90\u53cd\u6f14\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u503c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e3b\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u652f\u6491\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\uff1bKL\u6563\u5ea6\u5728\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff1bWasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2fBED\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u660e\u786e\u4e86KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cWasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645BED\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

For fields along both in-plane high-symmetry directions we observe that the spin excitation spectrum at and above a magnetic field of 8~T is gapped. Excitation modes then sharpen for increasing field but are consistently broader than experimental resolution even at 13.5~T. The out-of-plane dispersion diminishes in the 7-10~T regime, signifying enhanced two-dimensional behavior as the in-plane liquid correlations are established. In this regime, excitations are very broad and largely flat for all accessible energy-momenta, which is kinematically at odds with a magnon-decay picture. By contrast, a continuum of fractionalized excitations naturally yields a broad continuum response, which crucially may be accompanied by sharper modes of bound states of fractionalized excitations. Their damping by the continuum accounts for the observed spectral broadening and field dependence.

Current terminal benchmarks were built for evaluation, not training; reinforcement learning requires a scalable pipeline, not just a dataset.

From this pipeline we obtain 3255 tasks spanning file operations, log management, data processing, scripting, and database operations. We train agents using vanilla PPO with binary episode level rewards and a minimal interaction loop: no retrieval, multi-agent coordination, or specialized tools.

A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation.

This estimation involves applying powers of a unitary to the ground state, controlled by an auxiliary state prepared on a control register. In many applications the goal is to provide a confidence interval for the phase estimate, and optimal performance is provided by a discrete prolate spheroidal sequence. We show how to prepare the corresponding state in a far more efficient way than prior work. We find that a matrix product state representation with a bond dimension of 4 is sufficient to give a highly accurate approximation for all dimensions tested, up to $2^{24}$. This matrix product state can be efficiently prepared using a sequence of simple three-qubit operations. When the dimension is a power of 2, the phase estimation can be performed with only three qubits for the control register, making it suitable for early-generation fault-tolerant quantum computers with a limited number of logical qubits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u5236\u5907\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u79bb\u6563\u957f\u7403\u5e8f\u5217\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea64\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u79ef\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u6001\uff08\u79bb\u6563\u957f\u7403\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ec5\u4e3a4\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u79ef\u6001\uff08MPS\uff09\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76ee\u6807\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u4e09\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u9ad8\u6548\u5236\u5907\u8be5\u6001", "result": "\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9ad8\u8fbe2^24\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5MPS\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f53\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e3a2\u7684\u5e42\u65f6\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u4ec5\u97003\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u65e9\u671f\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd"}}

Since categorical features are usually with a limited number of qualitative possible values, the nested granular cluster effect is prevalent in the implicit discrete distance space of categorical data. That is, data objects frequently overlap in space or subspace to form small compact clusters, and similar small clusters often form larger clusters. However, the distance space cannot be well-defined like the Euclidean distance due to the qualitative categorical data values, which brings great challenges to the cluster analysis of categorical data. In view of this, we design a Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) algorithm to allow potential clusters to interactively tune themselves and converge in stages with different numbers of naturally compact clusters. To leverage MGCPL, we also propose a Cluster Aggregation strategy based on MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to first encode the data objects according to the learned multi-granular distributions, and then perform final clustering on the embeddings. It turns out that the proposed MGCPL-guided Categorical Data Clustering (MCDC) approach is competent in automatically exploring the nested distribution of multi-granular clusters and highly robust to categorical data sets from various domains. Benefiting from its linear time complexity, MCDC is scalable to large-scale data sets and promising in pre-partitioning data sets or compute nodes for boosting distributed computing.

However, the processes of detaching an ion from an array, reintegrating it, and driving non-uniform motion introduce severe heating, requiring significant time and laser power for re-cooling and stabilization. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel entangling scheme between a stationary ion qubit and a continuously transported mobile ion, which remains in uniform motion and minimizes motional heating. We theoretically demonstrate a gate error on the order of 0.01%, within reach of current technology. This approach enables resource-efficient quantum operations and facilitates long-distance entanglement distribution, where stationary trapped-ion arrays serve as memory units and mobile ions act as communication qubits passing beside them. Our results pave the way for an alternative trapped-ion architecture beyond the QCCD paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposing a trapped-ion quantum computing scheme where mobile ions remain in constant uniform motion during entanglement operations with stationary ions, eliminating shuttling-induced heating and enabling scalable architectures.", "motivation": "Conventional QCCD architectures for trapped-ion quantum computers suffer from severe motional heating and cooling delays when ions are shuttled between trap zones, significantly increasing operation time and laser power requirements.", "method": "Theoretical demonstration of an entangling gate scheme between stationary memory ions and continuously moving communication ions in uniform motion, avoiding acceleration/deceleration phases that cause heating.", "result": "Achieves predicted gate error rates of ~0.01% \u2013 comparable to state-of-the-art stationary gates \u2013 while maintaining ion mobility, enabling resource-efficient long-distance entanglement distribution.", "conclusion": "This motion-tolerant entanglement protocol establishes a viable alternative to QCCD architectures, using mobile ions as communication qubits and stationary arrays as memory units, advancing scalable trapped-ion quantum computing."}}

To address this, we propose \\textbf{BoostFGL}, a boosting-style framework for fairness-aware FGL.

Leveraging the structure of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, our approach predicts the Cumulative Incidence Function using the Fine-Gray formulation, achieving high predictive power with intrinsically transparent and auditable predictions.

Here, we present an adaptive graph model that decouples inference latency from computational complexity. By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy.

However, current TAG-FGL methods face three main challenges: \\textbf{(1) Overhead.} LLMs for processing long texts incur high token and computation costs. To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \\textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates. However, this one-shot condensation is often not client-adaptive, leading to suboptimal performance. \\textbf{(3) Interpretability.} LLM-based condensation further introduces a black-box bottleneck: summaries lack faithful attribution and clear grounding to specific source spans, making local inspection and auditing difficult. To address the above issues, we propose \\textbf{DANCE}, a new TAG-FGL paradigm with GC. To improve \\textbf{suboptimal} performance, DANCE performs round-wise, model-in-the-loop condensation refresh using the latest global model. To enhance \\textbf{interpretability}, DANCE preserves provenance by storing locally inspectable evidence packs that trace predictions to selected neighbors and source text spans. Across 8 TAG datasets, DANCE improves accuracy by \\textbf{2.33\\%} at an \\textbf{8\\%} condensation ratio, with \\textbf{33.42\\%} fewer tokens than baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDANCE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73af\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u6b21\u4f18\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57288\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53472.33%\uff0ctoken\u6d88\u8017\u51cf\u5c1133.42%\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a1) \u957f\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff1b2) \u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u6b21\u4f18\uff1b3) LLM\u9ed1\u7bb1\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDANCE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u91c7\u7528\u8f6e\u6b21\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73af\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\u5237\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u5b58\u50a8\u53ef\u672c\u5730\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u5305\u4fdd\u6301\u6eaf\u6e90\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u5230\u6e90\u90bb\u5c45\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDANCE\u57288%\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53472.33%\uff0ctoken\u6d88\u8017\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c1133.42%\u3002", "conclusion": "DANCE\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3aTAG-FGL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3002"}}

This has given rise to hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the quantum device performs only a small but vital part of the overall computation. Among these, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which combine a classical optimization procedure with quantum evaluation of a cost function, have emerged as particularly promising. However, barren plateaus and ill-conditioned optimization landscapes remain among the primary obstacles faced by VQAs, often leading to unstable convergence and high sensitivity to initialization. Motivated by this challenge, we investigate whether a purely classical remedy, standard L2 squared-norm regularization, can systematically stabilize hybrid quantum-classical optimization. Specifically, we augment the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) objective with a quadratic penalty proportional to the squared norm of the parameters, without modifying the quantum circuit or measurement process. Across all tested Hamiltonians, H2, LiH, and the Random Field Ising Model (RFIM), we observe improved performance over a broad window of the regularization strength.

To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. By suppressing hallucinations under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations, our framework ensures robust removal stable against weight shifts.

The performance of quantum algorithms is often measured by their query complexity, which quantifies the number of oracle calls required to access the input. The main parameters determining the complexity of QLS solvers are the condition number $\u03ba$ and sparsity $s$ of the linear system, and the target error $\u03b5$. To date, the best known query-complexity lower bound is $\u03a9(\u03ba\\log(1/\u03b5))$, which establishes the optimality of the most recent QLS solvers. The original proof of this lower bound is attributed to Harrow and Kothari, but their result is unpublished. Furthermore, when discussing a more general lower bound including the sparsity $s$ of the linear system, it has become folklore that it should read as $\u03a9( \u03ba\\sqrt{s}\\log(1/\u03b5))$. In this work, we establish the rigorous lower bound capturing the sparsity dependence of QLS. We prove the lower bound of $\u03a9(\u03ba\\sqrt{s})$ for any quantum algorithm that solves QLS with constant error.

To isolate the effect of collisions, we introduce Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension that maps the most frequent n-grams through a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) while retaining the original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier. Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.\n  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent \"hot-to-cold advantage flip\" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.\n  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes. The dominant limitation may lie in gating credit assignment rather than index accuracy, and collision-induced noise may provide beneficial regularization that should not be naively eliminated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728Engram\u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u9ad8\u9891\u952e\u78b0\u649e\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u78b0\u649e\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u5230\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u95e8\u63a7\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u800c\u975e\u7d22\u5f15\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u9ad8\u9891\u952e\u78b0\u649e\u662f\u5426\u662fEngram\u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d88\u9664\u78b0\u649e\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEngram-Nine\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u70ed\u5c42\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570(MPHF)\u6620\u5c04\u9ad8\u9891n-gram\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u591a\u5934\u54c8\u5e0c\u67e5\u627e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b7\u5c42\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u8def\u7531\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "1) \u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u672a\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\uff1b2) \u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\"\u70ed-\u51b7\u4f18\u52bf\u7ffb\u8f6c\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u70ed\u4f4d\u7f6e\u521d\u59cb\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f46\u6700\u7ec8\u88ab\u51b7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53cd\u8d85\uff1b3) \u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u914d\u7f6e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u66f4\u65e9\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u78b0\u649e\u8d77\u5230\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b4) \u5b58\u5728\u95e8\u63a7\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1a\u95e8\u63a7\u65e9\u671f\u504f\u597d\u70ed\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e3a\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u9ad8\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u67e5\u627e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\u5728\u4e8e\u95e8\u63a7\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u800c\u975e\u7d22\u5f15\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u78b0\u649e\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u7b80\u5355\u6d88\u9664\u3002"}}

However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples.

Each of these companies may choose different approaches and hardware architectures for their machines. This poses a problem for quantum software engineering, as the retargetability of quantum programs across different hardware platforms becomes a non-trivial challenge. In response to this problem, various retargetable quantum compilers have been presented in the scientific literature. These promise the ability to compile software for different hardware platforms, enabling retargetability for quantum software. In this paper, we develop and apply a metric by which the retargetability of the quantum compilers can be assessed.

Classical computational methods have enabled important breakthroughs in energy materials development, but they face scaling and time-complexity limitations, particularly for high-dimensional or strongly correlated material systems. Quantum computing (QC) promises to offer a paradigm shift by exploiting quantum bits with their superposition and entanglement to address challenging problems intractable for classical approaches. This perspective discusses the opportunities in leveraging QC to advance energy materials research and the challenges QC faces in solving complex and high-dimensional problems. We present cases on how QC, when combined with classical computing methods, can be used for the design and simulation of practical energy materials.

While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

Coupling a single ion to an optical cavity enables efficient emission of single photons into a single spatial mode and grants control over their temporal shape, phase and frequency. Using the long coherence time of the ion's internal states and employing a scheme to protect the coherence of the ion-cavity interaction, we demonstrate the generation of a two-photon entangled state with full control over the phase.

We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility.

While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are standard for this task, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.\n  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data.

In this setting, a learner may adaptively query the oracle with any sequence of vectors and observe the corresponding real-valued output. We begin with the simplest case, a single-head softmax-attention regressor. We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention. Next, motivated by the regime where the head dimension $r \\ll d$, we provide a randomised algorithm that learns single-head attention-based models with $O(rd)$ queries via compressed sensing arguments. We also study robustness to noisy oracle access, proving that under mild norm and margin conditions, the parameters can be estimated to $\\varepsilon$ accuracy with a polynomial number of queries even when outputs are only provided up to additive tolerance. Finally, we show that multi-head attention parameters are not identifiable from value queries in general -- distinct parameterisations can induce the same input-output map. Hence, guarantees analogous to the single-head setting are impossible without additional structural assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper studies learning Transformer models with black-box oracle access, showing single-head attention is efficiently learnable with O(d\u00b2) queries (or O(rd) under low-rank assumptions), while multi-head attention is generally unidentifiable without additional constraints.", "motivation": "Understanding the learnability of attention mechanisms from input-output queries is essential for interpreting, verifying, and auditing large language models when only black-box access is available, with implications for model extraction and security.", "method": "The authors develop elementary algorithms for single-head attention, leverage compressed sensing for low-rank regimes, analyze robustness to noisy oracles via norm and margin conditions, and prove identifiability limitations for multi-head attention through counterexamples.", "result": "(1) Exact learning of single-head attention with O(d\u00b2) queries; (2) O(rd) queries for low-rank head dimension r << d using compressed sensing; (3) \u03b5-accurate estimation with polynomial queries under noisy oracle tolerance; (4) Multi-head attention parameters are not identifiable in general.", "conclusion": "Single-head attention is efficiently learnable from black-box access, but multi-head attention requires additional structural assumptions for provable guarantees, revealing fundamental learnability differences between attention variants."}}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Quantum combs are powerful conceptual tools for capturing multi-time processes in quantum information theory, constituting the most general quantum mechanical process. But, despite their causal nature, they lack a meaningful physical connection to time -- and are, by and large, arguably incompatible with it without extra structure. The subclass of quantum combs which assumes an underlying process is described by the so-called process tensor framework, which has been successfully used to study and characterise non-Markovian open quantum systems. But, although process tensors are motivated by an underlying dynamics, it is not a priori clear how to connect to a continuous process tensor object mathematically -- leaving an uncomfortable conceptual gap. In this work, we take a decisive step toward remedying this situation. We introduce a fully continuous process tensor framework by showing how the discrete multi-partite Choi state becomes a field-theoretic state in bosonic Fock space, which is intrinsically and rigorously defined in the continuum. With this equipped, we lay out the core structural elements of this framework and its properties. This translation allows for an information-theoretic treatment of multi-time correlations in the continuum via the analysis of their continuous matrix product state representatives. Our work closes a gap in the quantum information literature, and opens up the opportunity for the application of many-body physics insights to our understanding of quantum stochastic processes in the continuum.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u591a\u4f53Choi\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u73bb\u8272\u798f\u514b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5f20\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u65f6\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u7684\u573a\u8bba\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u68b3\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u65f6\u91cf\u5b50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7269\u7406\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u8fde\u7eed\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u591a\u4f53Choi\u6001\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u73bb\u8272\u798f\u514b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u573a\u8bba\u6001\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5f20\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u7ed3\u6784\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u79ef\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u591a\u65f6\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u57df\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5bf9\u591a\u65f6\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5f20\u91cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c06\u591a\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u6d1e\u89c1\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Building on the switching gradient method, FedSGM provides projection-free, primal-only updates, avoiding expensive dual-variable tuning or inner solvers. To handle communication limits, FedSGM incorporates bi-directional error feedback, correcting the bias introduced by compression while explicitly understanding the interaction between compression noise and multi-step local updates. We derive convergence guarantees showing that the averaged iterate achieves the canonical $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate, with additional high-probability bounds that decouple optimization progress from sampling noise due to partial participation. Additionally, we introduce a soft switching version of FedSGM to stabilize updates near the feasibility boundary. To our knowledge, FedSGM is the first framework to unify functional constraints, compression, multiple local updates, and partial client participation, establishing a theoretically grounded foundation for constrained federated learning.

Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cfb\u6570(TAC)\u6765\u8f85\u52a9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u88ab\u8bd5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0TAC\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684Soft-TAC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728Gran Turismo 7\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8c03\u53c2\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u88ab\u8bd5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5728Lunar Lander\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f7f\u7528/\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528TAC\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faSoft-TAC\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Gran Turismo 7\u8d5b\u8f66\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "1) \u63d0\u4f9bTAC\u4f7f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528Soft-TAC\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u6355\u6349\u504f\u597d\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "TAC\u65e2\u53ef\u4f5c\u5956\u52b1\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Our contribution is not to replace cosine similarity, but to restore interpretability of its absolute values through monotone calibration, without altering its ranking properties.\n  We characterize isotonic calibration as an order-preserving reparameterization and prove that all order-based constructions (angular ordering, nearest neighbors, threshold graphs and quantile-based decisions) are invariant under this transformation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u4fdd\u5e8f\u56de\u5f52(isotonic regression)\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u8c03\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6392\u5e8f\u7279\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u8bef\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6570\u503c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8698%\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u867d\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5224\u6709\u5f3a\u79e9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4f7f\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bef\u6821\u51c6\uff1a\u5206\u6570\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u9ad8\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4(\u767d\u5316\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5fae\u8c03)\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e14\u9700\u91cd\u7b97\u6240\u6709\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5224\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fdd\u5e8f\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u5f81\u4e3a\u4fdd\u5e8f\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u5404\u7c7b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6784\u9020(\u89d2\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u3001\u9608\u503c\u56fe\u3001\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u51b3\u7b56)\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u4fdd\u6301\u79e9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e03\u79cd\u6270\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u4fdd\u630198%\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6784\u9020\u5747\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d21\u732e\u5e76\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8c03\u6821\u51c6\u6062\u590d\u5176\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARMD\u901a\u8fc7\u5757\u56e0\u679c\u67b6\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5757\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e25\u683c\u56e0\u679c\u3001\u7f6e\u6362\u7b49\u53d8\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u7f6e\u6362\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u5de6\u5230\u53f3\u548c\u968f\u673a\u8bcd\u5143\u987a\u5e8f\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6b65\u5e45\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\u8d85\u8d8a\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e76\u884c\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u89e3\u7801\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b(LDM)\u751f\u6210\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5728DDoS\u3001Mirai\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u4eba\u653b\u51fb\u4e09\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLDM\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347IDS\u6027\u80fd(F1\u8fbe0.99)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1125%\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6b63\u5e38\u6d41\u91cf\u8fdc\u591a\u4e8e\u653b\u51fb\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355(\u5982\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837)\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91c7\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b(LDM)\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u5728DDoS\u3001Mirai\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u4eba\u653b\u51fb\u4e09\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ece\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "LDM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4f7fIDS\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe\u52300.99(DDoS\u548cMirai\u653b\u51fb)\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea625%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u7269\u8054\u7f51ML-IDS\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}
