A key variant, sequence-to-graph alignment, plays a crucial role in effectively capturing genetic variations. In this work, we introduce two novel formulations within this framework: the Gap-Sensitive Co-Linear Chaining (Gap-CLC) problem and the Co-Linear Chaining with Errors based on Edit Distance (Edit-CLC) problem, and we investigate their computational complexity. We show that solving the Gap-CLC problem in sub-quadratic time is highly unlikely unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) fails -- even when restricted to binary alphabets. Furthermore, we establish that the Edit-CLC problem is NP-hard in the presence of errors within the graph. These findings emphasize that incorporating co-linear structures into sequence-to-graph alignment models fails to reduce computational complexity, highlighting that these models remain at least as computationally challenging to solve as those lacking such prior information."}

While asymmetric IR transmission at a specific incidence angle -- typically normal incidence -- is often emphasized, we show that such single-angle asymmetry is neither sufficient nor predictive of practical cooling performance. In this work, we demonstrate that effective non-contact PRC requires angularly distributed asymmetric IR transparency evaluated through hemispherical integration over emission directions, rather than asymmetry at a single incidence angle. To quantify this effect, an angle-resolved full-wave electromagnetic (EM) model with Bloch periodic boundary conditions and Floquet mode decomposition is employed to compute wavelength- and angle-dependent bidirectional reflection and transmission of periodic PRC structures. The resulting EM response is coupled to an energy-balance-based thermal model to predict the transient temperature evolution of the cooling object. By comparing models that account for the full angular distribution with normal-incidence-only approximations, we show that pronounced asymmetric transmission at normal incidence is generally not preserved at oblique angles. As a result, angular integration yields only marginal cooling or may even result in net heating, whereas normal-incidence-based models can substantially overestimate cooling performance. These results establish angularly distributed asymmetric transparency as a key EM design principle for IR-transparent PRC and wide-angle asymmetric metasurfaces."}

However, as a collision kernel, it dose not guarantee the entrinsic detailed balance and is not integrable. In this work, the Pullin equation, which possesses an integrable collision kernel and satisfies the detailed balance constraint, is adopted as an extended Boltzmann equation for the theoretical analysis of near-continuum relaxation mechanisms. For clarity, only the translational and rotational degrees are considered in this work. Explicit analytical expressions for the temporal relaxation of macroscopic variables, including the stress force, (translational/rotational) temperature and heat flux, are obtained at the first time. This is achieved by approximating the distribution function in mixed Hermite and Laguerre for rotation and computing the collision operator moments, enabling a direct description of macroscopic non-equilibrium evolution. Base on the same elementary moment (integral) of collision operator, the macroscopic transport coefficients is found in Chapman-Enskog framework. The long-standing speculation, that thermal conduction coefficient should be depended on the degrees of thermal non-equilibrium, is rigorously confirmed and evaluated. When thermal equilibrium is enforced, the present thermal conduction coefficients can be degenerated to the famous results of Mason and Monchick. Given the correct relaxation rate, a Rykov-type novel relaxation model for Pullin equation is proposed. It can recover the interaction of transaltional and rotatioanl heat fluxes in relaxation process, which is ignored in the widely used Rykov equation. Finally, the precision of this new Rykov-type equation is examined using a series of benchmark test cases."}
