The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents."}

There is a large potential to minimize production costs through automated scheduling techniques, due to the large-scale requirements of modern factories. In the past, solution approaches have been studied for many machine scheduling variations, where even basic variants have been shown to be NP-hard. However, in today's real-life production environments, additional complex precedence constraints and resource restrictions with calendars arise that must be fulfilled. These additional constraints cannot be tackled efficiently by existing solution techniques. Thus, there is a strong need to develop and analyze automated methods that can solve such real-life parallel machine scheduling scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel variant of parallel machine scheduling with job precedences and calendar-based cumulative resource constraints that arises in real-life industrial use cases. A constraint modeling approach is proposed as an exact solution method for small scheduling scenarios together with state-of-the-art constraint-solving technology. Further, we propose a construction heuristic as well as a tailored metaheuristic using local search to efficiently tackle large-scale problem instances. This metaheuristic approach has been deployed and is currently being used in an industrial setting."}

Here, we show that the effect can be realized even when the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly correlated and gapped. The system under consideration consists of a single spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ impurity coupled isotropically to $n$ spin singlet superconducting channels realized by one-dimensional leads with quasi-long-range superconducting order. The competition between the Kondo and superconducting fluctuations induces multiple distinct ground states and boundary phases depending on the relative strengths of the bulk and boundary interactions. Using the Bethe Ansatz technique, we identify four regimes: an overscreened Kondo phase, a zero-mode phase, a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) phase, and a local-moment phase with an unscreened impurity, each with its own experimental characteristic. We describe the renormalization-group flow, the excitation spectrum, and the full impurity thermodynamics in each phase. Remarkably, even in the presence of a bulk mass gap, the boundary critical behavior in the Kondo phase is governed by the same exponents as in the gapless theory with the low-energy impurity sector flowing to the $SU(2)_n$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) fixed point, and the impurity entropy monotonically decreasing as a function of temperature. In both the overscreened Kondo and zero-mode phases, the residual impurity entropy is $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T \\to 0) = \\ln[2\\cos(π/(n+2))]$. In the YSR and unscreened phases on the other hand the impurity entropy exhibits non-monotonic temperature dependence and is effectively free at low temperatures with $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T \\to 0) = \\ln 2$."}

Our first set of experiments find a suitable model for the task to imitate player demonstrations, using Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning: combining Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, and Proximal Policy Optimization. The second set of experiments evaluates the constructed model with player tests, where models are trained on demonstrations provided by participants.

The mechanism for generating the flow is distinct from the case of the Kondo problem (codimension-three defects) in that the effective particle-hole asymmetry that leads to the log running is due to the spatial anisotropy generated by the defect. The mechanism for the log generation has a simple geometric explanation which shows that hole fluctuations are suppressed as the incoming momentum is taken to be along the direction of the defect. The RG flow time is shown to scale with the length of the defect. We also show that the dislon, the Goldstone mode localized to the defect, couples in a non-derivative fashion to the bulk fermions and becomes relevant above the dislons' Debye frequency which depends upon the defect tension."}

While the utility of adding user data often exhibits diminishing returns (i.e., submodularity), enabling near-optimal greedy selection, real-world personalization is complicated by structural constraints. These include logical dependencies (e.g., selecting fact A requires fact B), categorical quotas (e.g., select at most one writing style), and hierarchical rules (e.g., select at most two social media preferences, of which at most one can be for a professional network). These constraints violate the assumptions of standard subset selection algorithms. We propose a principled method to formally model such constraints. We introduce a compilation process that transforms a user's knowledge graph with dependencies into a set of abstract macro-facets. Our central result is a proof that common hierarchical and quota-based constraints over these macro-facets form a valid laminar matroid. This theoretical characterization lets us cast structured personalization as submodular maximization under a matroid constraint, enabling greedy with constant-factor guarantees (and (1-1/e) via continuous greedy) for a much richer and more realistic class of problems."}

Focusing on the combined effects of single-ion anisotropy, Zeeman field, next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) exchange, and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction, we analyze how these parameters influence the magnetization curves and magnon spectra. This work serves two main goals. First, we critically examine the limitations of SRSWT, showing that in the absence of external or interaction tuning, the theory tends to overestimate magnon self-energy corrections, often predicting first-order magnetic transitions with multivalued magnetization and metastable solution branches (i.e., self-consistent but thermodynamically unstable states). Second, we demonstrate that topological transitions -- signaled by magnon gap closings at the Dirac points -- can be tuned to occur below the magnetic transition temperature and within the thermodynamically stable regime. In particular, we identify two practical tuning strategies: applying an external Zeeman field of appropriate sign depending on the anisotropy strength, and introducing a small antiferromagnetic NNN exchange coupling. These findings not only clarify the predictive scope and limitations of SRSWT but also provide experimentally relevant guidance for realizing thermally driven topological transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb magnetic insulators."}

Based on the Ising model, we theoretically estimate the synchronized frequencies and the synchronization transition points, which agree well with numerical results."}

We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control. Overall, reusable value profiles provide a tractable computational account of belief-conditioned value control in volatile environments and yield testable signatures of belief-dependent control and behavioral flexibility."}

In turn, by adopting the KPZ framework, we gain fresh insight into the structure and phenomenology of Anderson localization itself. We analyze both localized eigenstates and time-evolved wave packets, demonstrating that the fluctuation of their logarithmic density follows the KPZ scaling. Moreover, we reveal that the internal structure of these eigenstates exhibits glassy features characteristic of the directed polymer problem, including the emergence of dominant paths together with pinning and avalanche behavior. Localization is not isotropic but organized along preferential branches of weaker confinement, corresponding to these dominant paths. For localized wave packets, we further demonstrate that their spatial profiles obey a stretched-exponential form consistent with the KPZ scaling, while remaining fully compatible with the single-parameter scaling (SPS) hypothesis, a cornerstone of Anderson localization theory. Altogether, our results establish a unified KPZ framework for describing fluctuations and microscopic organization in 2D Anderson localization, revealing the glassy nature of localized states and providing new understanding into the universal structure of disordered quantum systems."}

Additionally, the relaxation becomes progressively slower with time. The created nonequilibrium state of the glassy system is conveniently described by introducing a fictive temperature which provides the instantaneous state of the nonequilibrium system. The fictive temperature $T_{f} (t)$ is time dependent. During cooling, the fictive temperature is higher than the actual temperature. After the cooling or quenching has ceased, the fictive temperature approaches the final temperature at a rate that depends on the relaxation properties of the liquid. In this work we use linear response theory to connect the time dependence of the fictive temperature to memory function which is shown to be related to the frequency dependent specific heat which itself depends on the fictive temperature $T_{f} (t)$. Thus, one requires { \\it a self-consistent calculation} to capture the interdependence of relaxation rate and structural response function. We present a numerical calculation where we apply our relations to silica where the relaxation function that describes the frequency dependent specific heat and is modeled as a stretched exponential William-Watts (WW) function, while the relaxation time is modeled as a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT).

Understanding how redundant and synergistic interaction emerges from elementary connectivity patterns is important in characterizing the behavior of physical, biological, and engineering systems. In this study, the information-theoretic framework of Partial Information Decomposition (PID) is employed to investigate how pairs of signals measured at the nodes of large network systems contribute individually and in cooperation with each other to determine the overall state of the network. The analyzed systems are networks of numerically simulated Roessler oscillators and physical single-transistor electronic chaotic oscillators, reproducing purely pairwise and symmetric links in biological neuronal cultures, and cortical electroencephalographic networks assessed in humans. In the two settings, PID was extensively applied to decompose the information brought by pairs of signals to the overall state of the system, assessed respectively as the dynamic regime (from asynchronous chaos to synchronization) and the subject condition (open vs. closed eyes). Our approach highlights the coexistence of redundant and synergistic interplay in determining the effect of the pairwise dynamics on the system's state. Specifically, we demonstrate how, in a highly synchronized system, where units act following overlapped redundant behaviors, their joint consideration helps determine the system's state though their synergistic interactions. Our findings reveal the emergence of non-trivial behaviors in networked system based on pairwise connections and straightforward neural states, highlighting the need for using appropriate analytical tools to capture complex phenomena."}

By contrast, under the same levels of data corruption, class-conditional diffusion models degrade catastrophically (image-label consistency plummets by 56.81% relative to baseline), while classifiers show a moderate impact that diminishes with dataset scale. To explain these discrepancies, we analyze the results through a multi-perspective lens, integrating information theory, PAC learning, and gradient dynamics.

Stepanov"], "title": "Diagrammatics in the Dual Space, or There and Back Again", "comment": "Habilitation thesis", "summary": "Accurately describing many-body effects in multi-orbital systems remains a major challenge in theoretical condensed matter physics. At present, there is a significant methodological gap between the numerical tools used in ab initio computational materials science and those developed to study strong electronic correlations. The former can treat realistic, large-scale systems but typically neglect many-body effects, while the latter focus on simplified models with only a few degrees of freedom, as only such models can be solved accurately in the presence of strong interactions. The purpose of this thesis is to bridge these two approaches and establish a systematic theoretical framework for realistic correlated electronic materials. This involves a full-cycle methodology that begins with constructing ab initio interacting models from density-functional theory, solving them using dynamical mean-field theory to capture local correlations, and extending beyond to incorporate non-local collective electronic fluctuations. To this end, we introduce the \"dual\" approach to strong correlations, which includes the dual fermion, dual boson, and dual triply irreducible local expansion methods. The central idea of the dual theories is to shift the reference point of the conventional Feynman diagrammatic expansion from a non-interacting electronic system to an interacting but exactly solvable one. Integrating out this reference system recasts the expansion in an effective dual space, where all diagrammatic building blocks are renormalized by the corresponding impurity quantities.

Recently, a novel class of non-equilibrium phase transitions was uncovered [Phys. Rev. Res. {\\bf 7}, L032049 (2025)], showing that the combined effects of simultaneous contact with thermal baths at different temperatures and external driving forces can split the conventional order-disorder transition into two distinct critical points, determined by which ordered state initially dominates. We show the robustness of this phenomenon by extending a minimal interacting-spin model from the idealized case of simultaneous bath coupling to a finite-time coupling protocol. In particular, we introduce two protocols in which the system interacts with a single bath at a time: a stochastic protocol, where the system randomly switches between the baths at different temperatures, and a deterministic protocol where the coupling alternates periodically. Our analysis reveals two key results: (i) the splitting of phase transitions persists across all coupling schemes -- simultaneous, stochastic, and deterministic -- and (ii) different optimizations of power and efficiency in a collectively operating heat engine reveal that both the stochastic and deterministic protocols exhibit superior global performance at intermediate switching rates and periods when compared to simultaneous coupling. The global trade-off between power and efficiency is described by an expression solely depending on the temperatures of thermal reservoirs as the efficiency approaches to the ideal limit."}

To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting. Remarkably, the model requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning.

We bring this idea back to one dimension by introducing a holographic isoTNS ansatz: a (1+1)-dimensional lattice of isometric tensors where the horizontal axis encodes physical space and an auxiliary \"holographic\" axis boosts expressivity. Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS). First, we show that randomly initialized holographic isoTNS typically display volume-law entanglement even at modest bond dimension, surpassing the representational limits of MPS and related ansätze. Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS. While the method remains efficient and scalable, error accumulation over TEBD sweeps suppresses entanglement and leads to rapid deviations from exact dynamics. Overall, holographic isoTNS broaden the reach of tensor-network methods, opening new avenues to study physics in the volume-law regime."}

Yet, the established theory applies only to uniform MPS with periodic boundary conditions, leaving many physically relevant states beyond its reach. Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators."}

By introducing triaxial strain, we create an effective vector potential that couples to Majorana fermions and leads to Landau quantization. Our calculations show that the low-energy spectrum forms discrete pseudo-Landau levels of the Majorana Fermi surface. We further demonstrate that the strain-induced effective vector potential gives rise to pronounced quantum oscillations of the density of states and the specific heat at very low temperatures, in close analogy to the de Haas-van Alphen effect for charged electrons in metals. These results indicate that Landau-quantization-driven \"Majorana quantum oscillations\" can serve as a probe of the charge-neutral Majorana Fermi surface in Kitaev materials."}

We show for general transport coefficients that the steady density and temperature fields are functions of the pressure and a kinetic field that quantifies the quadratic excess velocity relative to the ratio of heat flux and shear stress. This kinetic field obeys in turn a spatial scaling law controlled by pressure and stress, which is inherited by the stationary density and temperature fields. We develop a scaling approach to measure the associated master curves, and confirm our predictions through compelling data collapses in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of paradigmatic model fluids. Interestingly, the robustness of the scaling laws in the face of significant finite-size effects reveals the surprising accuracy of NSF equations in describing molecular-scale stationary flows. Overall, these scaling laws provide a novel characterization of stationary states in driven fluids."}

In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation.

While traditionally derived from specific microscopic mechanisms, the ubiquity of these laws suggests a more general organizing principle. This article proposes a statistical-mechanics framework in which such interaction laws emerge as macroscopic fixed points of aggregation processes involving strongly heterogeneous microscopic contributions.\n  We consider systems where individual interaction sources exhibit heavy-tailed heterogeneity consistent with Zipf-Pareto statistics and where aggregation proceeds without intrinsic length scales. Under minimal assumptions of heterogeneity, multiplicativity, scale invariance, and stability under coarse-graining, we show that the resulting macroscopic interaction field must adopt a scale-free, power-law form. The associated exponent is not imposed a priori but emerges from effective dimensionality, symmetry, and aggregation structure.\n  Within this framework, the inverse-square law is interpreted as a stable statistical fixed point corresponding to isotropic aggregation in an effective three-dimensional space, while deviations from this regime naturally arise from anisotropy, constrained geometries, or nontrivial effective dimensions. This perspective provides a unified interpretation of interaction laws observed in physics, spatial economics, and human geography, without invoking domain-specific microscopic mechanisms.\n  The proposed framework reframes inverse power-law interactions as robust emergent features of Zipfian aggregation rather than as unique consequences of particular physical forces, thereby offering a common statistical explanation for their cross-disciplinary recurrence."}

Such light-matter interactions are often studied with a broad variety of analytical and computational methods that are constrained by approximation techniques or by computational scaling. Quantum processors present a new avenue to address these challenges. We consider the case of cavity mediated two-qubit gates. To investigate quantum state transfer between the qubits, we implement simulations with quantum circuits that are able to reliably track the dynamics of the system. Our quantum algorithm, compatible with NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era systems, allows us to map out the fidelity of the state transfer operation between qubits as a function of a broad range of system parameters including the respective detunings between the qubits and the cavity, the damping factor of the cavity, and the respective couplings between the qubits and the cavity. The algorithm provides a robust and intuitive solution, alongside a satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions or classical simulation algorithms in their respective regimes of validity. It allows us to identify under-explored regimes of optimal performance, relevant for heterogeneous quantum platforms, where the two-qubit gate can be rather effective between far-detuned qubits that are neither resonant with each other nor with the cavity. Besides its present application, the method introduced in the current paper can be efficiently used in otherwise untractable variations of the model and in various efforts to simulate and optimize photon-mediated two-qubit gates and other relevant operations in quantum information processing."}

Traditional log analysis techniques, including template-based and sequence-driven approaches, often lose important semantic information or struggle with ambiguous log patterns. To address this, we present EnrichLog, a training-free, entry-based anomaly detection framework that enriches raw log entries with both corpus-specific and sample-specific knowledge. EnrichLog incorporates contextual information, including historical examples and reasoning derived from the corpus, to enable more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. The framework leverages retrieval-augmented generation to integrate relevant contextual knowledge without requiring retraining. We evaluate EnrichLog on four large-scale system log benchmark datasets and compare it against five baseline methods. Our results show that EnrichLog consistently improves anomaly detection performance, effectively handles ambiguous log entries, and maintains efficient inference. Furthermore, incorporating both corpus- and sample-specific knowledge enhances model confidence and detection accuracy, making EnrichLog well-suited for practical deployments."}

This paper argues that DPO does not rewrite a models internal beliefs; instead, it acts as a low rank steering mechanism that nudges activations along a small number of preference directions. Using a simple derivation, we show that the DPO gradient depends only on the difference between the logit embeddings of preferred and dispreferred completions, implying a first order shift in the final hidden representation rather than a deep restructuring of semantics. We then extract an empirical steering vector from a DPO tuned model and demonstrate that adding this vector to base activations reproduces most of the aligned behavior, while subtracting it nearly restores the original model. Finally, spectral analyses reveal rank-one dominance and entropy collapse in upper layers, indicating that alignment is funneled through a narrow subspace. Taken together, these results support a behavioral illusion view of DPO: it teaches models how to act aligned, not what to believe."}

Each task requires many iterations and numerous circuits per iteration, and real-world applications often involve multiple tasks, scaling with the precision needed to explore the application's energy landscape. This demands an enormous number of execution shots, making practical use prohibitively expensive. We observe that VQA costs can be significantly reduced by exploiting execution similarities across an application's tasks. Based on this insight, we propose TreeVQA, a tree-based execution framework that begins by executing tasks jointly and progressively branches only as their quantum executions diverge. Implemented as a VQA wrapper, TreeVQA integrates with typical VQA applications.

We propose The Forecast Critic, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated forecast monitoring, taking advantage of their broad world knowledge and strong ``reasoning'' capabilities. As a prerequisite for this, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to assess time series forecast quality, focusing on three key questions. (1) Can LLMs be deployed to perform forecast monitoring and identify obviously unreasonable forecasts? (2) Can LLMs effectively incorporate unstructured exogenous features to assess what a reasonable forecast looks like? (3) How does performance vary across model sizes and reasoning capabilities, measured across state-of-the-art LLMs? We present three experiments, including on both synthetic and real-world forecasting data. Our results show that LLMs can reliably detect and critique poor forecasts, such as those plagued by temporal misalignment, trend inconsistencies, and spike errors. The best-performing model we evaluated achieves an F1 score of 0.88, somewhat below human-level performance (F1 score: 0.97). We also demonstrate that multi-modal LLMs can effectively incorporate unstructured contextual signals to refine their assessment of the forecast. Models correctly identify missing or spurious promotional spikes when provided with historical context about past promotions (F1 score: 0.84). Lastly, we demonstrate that these techniques succeed in identifying inaccurate forecasts on the real-world M5 time series dataset, with unreasonable forecasts having an sCRPS at least 10% higher than that of reasonable forecasts. These findings suggest that LLMs, even without domain-specific fine-tuning, may provide a viable and scalable option for automated forecast monitoring and evaluation."}

A classical Kondo-lattice model (CKLM) attributes this non-Drude conductivity to scattering of itinerant electrons by localized magnetic moments, persisting down to temperatures well below the magnetic ordering scale.

However, the dominant paradigm for network optimization relies on designing specialist policies based on handcrafted rules or deep learning models, leading to poor generalization across diverse tasks and environments. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), pretrained on Internet-scale corpora, provide a rich and unified knowledge base that encodes fundamental networking principles. Combined with their emergent abilities in generalization to unseen scenarios, LLMs offer a transformative foundation for generalist network policies that can generalize across diverse tasks and environments with minimal adaptation. In this paper, we present Trailblazer, the first systematic framework to realize such a generalist policy for networking. Trailblazer incorporates a network alignment scheme to ground the LLM in specific networking tasks, and an adaptive policy collaboration mechanism that offloads simple control cases from the LLM to a lightweight policy for computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations and large-scale real-world online evaluation on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), Trailblazer, powered by a single LLM, demonstrates stronger cross-task and cross-environment generalization than conventional specialist policies. Our results validate LLMs as the foundation for generalist network policies, and position Trailblazer as the first step toward the generalist-driven paradigm that enables strong generalization with minimal efforts in policy design."}

However, we argue that existing methods are limited since the label consistency is not guaranteed during demonstration selection. Our cognition derives from the Bayesian view of ICL and our rethinking of ICL from the transductive label propagation perspective. We treat ICL as a transductive learning method and incorporate latent concepts from Bayesian view and deduce that similar demonstrations guide the concepts of query, with consistent labels serving as estimates. Based on this understanding, we establish a label propagation framework to link label consistency with propagation error bounds. To model label consistency, we propose a data synthesis method, leveraging both semantic and label information, and use TopK sampling with Synthetic Data (TopK-SD) to acquire demonstrations with consistent labels.

Here, we show that the effect can be realized even when the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly correlated and gapped. The system under consideration consists of a single spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ impurity coupled isotropically to $n$ spin singlet superconducting channels realized by one-dimensional leads with quasi-long-range superconducting order. The competition between the Kondo and superconducting fluctuations induces multiple distinct ground states and boundary phases depending on the relative strengths of the bulk and boundary interactions. Using the Bethe Ansatz technique, we identify four regimes: an overscreened Kondo phase, a zero-mode phase, a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) phase, and a local-moment phase with an unscreened impurity, each with its own experimental characteristic. We describe the renormalization-group flow, the excitation spectrum, and the full impurity thermodynamics in each phase. Remarkably, even in the presence of a bulk mass gap, the boundary critical behavior in the Kondo phase is governed by the same exponents as in the gapless theory with the low-energy impurity sector flowing to the $SU(2)_n$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) fixed point, and the impurity entropy monotonically decreasing as a function of temperature. In both the overscreened Kondo and zero-mode phases, the residual impurity entropy is $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T \\to 0) = \\ln[2\\cos(π/(n+2))]$.

Recent advances in patch-based Transformer models have shown strong potential in various time series forecasting tasks. However, most existing methods rely on fixed-size patch embedding, making it difficult to model the complex and heterogeneous patterns of airport passenger flows. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deformable temporal-spectral transformer named DTSFormer that integrates a multiscale deformable partitioning module and a joint temporal-spectral filtering module. Specifically, the input sequence is dynamically partitioned into multiscale temporal patches via a novel window function-based masking, enabling the extraction of heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages. Then, within each scale, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to capture both high- and low-frequency components, thereby emphasizing the volatility and periodicity inherent in airport passenger flows. Finally, the resulting multi-frequency features are subsequently fused in the time domain to jointly model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world passenger flow data collected at Beijing Capital International Airport from January 2023 to March 2024. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across different prediction horizons. Further analysis shows that the deformable partitioning module aligns patch lengths with dominant periods and heterogeneous trends, enabling superior capture of sudden high-frequency fluctuations."}

For example, fully symmetry-adapted universal operator pools typically generate long and deep quantum circuits, gate-efficient universal operator pools generally break symmetries, and gate-efficient fully symmetry-adapted operator pools may not be universal. In this work, we analyze such symmetry dilemmas both theoretically and numerically. On the theory side, we prove that the popular, gate-efficient operator pool consisting of singlet spin-adapted singles and perfect-pairing doubles is not universal when spatial symmetry is enforced. To demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the three types of pools, we perform numerical simulations using an adaptive algorithm paired with operator pools that are (i) fully symmetry-adapted and universal, (ii) fully symmetry-adapted and non-universal, and (iii) breaking a single symmetry and are universal. Our numerical simulations encompass three physically relevant scenarios in which the target state is (i) the global ground state, (ii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in multiple symmetry properties, and (iii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in a single symmetry property. Our results show when symmetry-breaking but universal pools can be used safely, when enforcing at least one distinguishing symmetry suffices, and when a particular symmetry must be rigorously preserved to avoid variational collapse. Together, the formal and numerical analysis provides a practical guide for designing and benchmarking symmetry-adapted operator pools that balance universality, resource requirements, and robust state targeting in quantum simulations for chemistry."}

I argue that the deeper conflict is logical: quantum theory is inherently contextual, whereas the classical tradition presupposes a single global, Boolean valuation. Building on Bohr's complementarity, the Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen argument and Bell's theorem, I recast locality and completeness as the existence of a global section of a presheaf of value assignments over the category of measurement contexts. The absence of global sections expresses the impossibility of context-independent description, and Čech cohomology measures the resulting obstruction. The internal logic of the presheaf topos is intuitionistic, and the seven-valued contextual logic proposed by Ghose and Patra is exhibited as a finite Heyting algebra capturing patterns of truth, falsity and indeterminacy across incompatible contexts. Classical physics corresponds to the sheaf case, where compatible local data glue and Boolean logic is effectively restored. Measurement is therefore reinterpreted as sheafification of presheaf-valued truth rather than as a physical breakdown of unitarity. Finally, a $σ$--$λ$ dynamics motivated by stochastic mechanics provides a continuous interpolation between strongly contextual and approximately classical regimes, dissolving the usual measurement paradoxes and apparent nonlocality as artefacts of an illegitimate demand for global truth."}

A scalar cognitive potential combines predictive accuracy, structural parsimony, task utility, and normative or logical requirements. Cognition unfolds as the Riemannian gradient flow of this potential, providing a universal dynamical law from which a broad range of psychological phenomena arise. Classical dual-process effects--rapid intuitive responses and slower deliberative reasoning--emerge naturally from metric-induced anisotropies that generate intrinsic time-scale separations and geometric phase transitions, without invoking modular or hybrid architectures.

Here, we present extensive numerical evidence that fluctuations in two-dimensional (2D) Anderson localization belongs to the (1+1)-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In turn, by adopting the KPZ framework, we gain fresh insight into the structure and phenomenology of Anderson localization itself. We analyze both localized eigenstates and time-evolved wave packets, demonstrating that the fluctuation of their logarithmic density follows the KPZ scaling. Moreover, we reveal that the internal structure of these eigenstates exhibits glassy features characteristic of the directed polymer problem, including the emergence of dominant paths together with pinning and avalanche behavior. Localization is not isotropic but organized along preferential branches of weaker confinement, corresponding to these dominant paths. For localized wave packets, we further demonstrate that their spatial profiles obey a stretched-exponential form consistent with the KPZ scaling, while remaining fully compatible with the single-parameter scaling (SPS) hypothesis, a cornerstone of Anderson localization theory. Altogether, our results establish a unified KPZ framework for describing fluctuations and microscopic organization in 2D Anderson localization, revealing the glassy nature of localized states and providing new understanding into the universal structure of disordered quantum systems."}

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning."}

By introducing triaxial strain, we create an effective vector potential that couples to Majorana fermions and leads to Landau quantization. Our calculations show that the low-energy spectrum forms discrete pseudo-Landau levels of the Majorana Fermi surface. We further demonstrate that the strain-induced effective vector potential gives rise to pronounced quantum oscillations of the density of states and the specific heat at very low temperatures, in close analogy to the de Haas-van Alphen effect for charged electrons in metals.

We introduce a quantum-aware generative AI framework that systematically addresses this limitation through tight integration of multi-fidelity learning and active validation. Our approach employs a diffusion-based generator conditioned on quantum-mechanical descriptors and a validator using an equivariant neural network potential trained on a hierarchical dataset spanning multiple levels of theory (PBE, SCAN, HSE06, CCSD(T)). Crucially, we implement a robust active learning loop that quantifies and targets the divergence between low- and high-fidelity predictions. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to deconstruct the contribution of each component, perform detailed failure mode analysis, and benchmark our framework against state-of-the-art generative models (CDVAE, GNoME, DiffCSP) across several challenging material classes. Our results demonstrate significant practical gains: a 3-5x improvement in successfully identifying potentially stable candidates in high-divergence regions (e.g., correlated oxides) compared to DFT-only baselines, while maintaining computational feasibility.

This study leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to automate actuator settings for optimal greenhouse management. To enhance interpretability and trust in the model decision-making process, both local and global explanation techniques were employed using model-inherent interpretation, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley additive explanations (SHAP).

Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS).

Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS.

While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics."}

This work presents an implementation-level comparison of three representative encodings -- Angle, Amplitude, and a Hybrid phase/angle scheme -- for QCNNs under depolarizing noise. We develop a fully differentiable PyTorch--Qiskit pipeline with a custom autograd bridge, batched parameter-shift gradients, and shot scheduling, and use it to train QCNNs on downsampled binary variants of MNIST and Fashion-MNIST at $4\\times 4$ and $8\\times 8$ resolutions.\n  Our experiments reveal regime-dependent trade-offs. On aggressively downsampled $4\\times 4$ inputs, Angle encoding attains higher accuracy and remains comparatively robust as noise increases, while the Hybrid encoder trails and exhibits non-monotonic trends. At $8\\times 8$, the Hybrid scheme can overtake Angle under moderate noise, suggesting that mixed phase/angle encoders benefit from additional feature bandwidth.

Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra.

However, recent work suggests that relying on approximate symmetry can offer greater flexibility and robustness. Despite promising empirical evidence, there has been little theoretical understanding, and in particular, a direct comparison between exact and approximate symmetry is missing from the literature. In this paper, we initiate this study by asking: What is the cost of enforcing exact versus approximate symmetry? To address this question, we introduce averaging complexity, a framework for quantifying the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. Our main result is an exponential separation: under standard conditions, achieving exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, whereas approximate symmetry can be attained with only logarithmic averaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first theoretical separation of these two cases, formally justifying why approximate symmetry may be preferable in practice. Beyond this, our tools and techniques may be of independent interest for the broader study of symmetries in machine learning."}

With a constellation of satellites and a set of ground stations in a satellite-based QKD system, how to schedule satellites to achieve efficient QKD is an important problem. This problem has been studied in the dual-downlink architecture, where each satellite distributes pairs of entanglements to two ground stations simultaneously. However, it has not been studied in the single downlink architecture, where satellites create keys with each individual ground station, and then serve as trusted nodes to create keys between pairs of ground stations. While the single downlink architecture provides weaker security in that the satellites need to be trusted, it has many advantages, including the potential of achieving significantly higher key rates, and generating keys between pairs of ground stations that are far away from each other and cannot be served using the dual-downlink architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel opportunistic approach for satellite scheduling that accounts for fairness among the ground station pairs, while taking advantage of the dynamic satellite channels to maximize the system performance. We evaluate this approach in a wide range of settings and demonstrate that it provides the best tradeoffs in terms of total and minimum key rates across the ground station pairs. Our evaluation also highlights the importance of considering seasonal effects and cloud coverage in evaluating satellite-based QKD systems. In addition, we show different tradeoffs in global and regional QKD systems."}

The present research conceptualises critical thinking in AI use as a dispositional tendency to verify the source and content of AI-generated information, to understand how models work and where they fail, and to reflect on the broader implications of relying on AI. Across six studies (N = 1365), we developed and validated the 13-item critical thinking in AI use scale and mapped its nomological network. Study 1 generated and content-validated scale items. Study 2 supported a three-factor structure (Verification, Motivation, and Reflection). Studies 3, 4, and 5 confirmed this higher-order model, demonstrated internal consistency and test-retest reliability, strong factor loadings, sex invariance, and convergent and discriminant validity. Studies 3 and 4 further revealed that critical thinking in AI use was positively associated with openness, extraversion, positive trait affect, and frequency of AI use. Lastly, Study 6 demonstrated criterion validity of the scale, with higher critical thinking in AI use scores predicting more frequent and diverse verification strategies, greater veracity-judgement accuracy in a novel and naturalistic ChatGPT-powered fact-checking task, and deeper reflection about responsible AI. Taken together, the current work clarifies why and how people exercise oversight over generative AI outputs and provides a validated scale and ecologically grounded task paradigm to support theory testing, cross-group, and longitudinal research on critical engagement with generative AI outputs."}

However, achieving efficient GNN inference on edge devices poses significant challenges, limiting their application in real-world edge scenarios. This is due to the high computational cost of GNNs and limited hardware resources on edge devices, which prevent GNN inference from meeting real-time and energy requirements. As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs. To address this, we propose GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN architecture-mapping Co-design and deployment on Device-Edge hierarchies. By abstracting the device communication process into an explicit operation, GCoDE fuses the architecture and mapping scheme in a unified design space for joint optimization. Additionally, GCoDE's system performance awareness enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency across diverse heterogeneous systems. By analyzing the energy consumption of various GNN operations, GCoDE introduces an energy prediction method that improves energy assessment accuracy and identifies energy-efficient solutions. Using a constraint-based random search strategy, GCoDE identifies the optimal solution in 1.5 hours, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the integrated co-inference engine in GCoDE enables efficient deployment and execution of GNN co-inference. Experimental results show that GCoDE can achieve up to 44.9x speedup and 98.2% energy reduction compared to existing approaches across diverse applications and system configurations."}

Using the Fermi-Hubbard model on lattices up to 3x3, we show that this breakdown appears at half-filling on the 2x2 lattice and extends to both half-filled and doped configurations on the 3x3 lattice. We then introduce an imaginary-time-enhanced FALQON (ITE-FALQON) scheme, which inserts short imaginary-time evolution steps into the feedback loop. The hybrid method suppresses excited-state components, escapes degenerate subspaces, and restores monotonic energy descent. The ITE-FALQON achieves a reliable ground-state convergence across all fillings, providing a practical route to scalable ground-state preparation in strongly correlated quantum systems."}

Existing methods often rely on pairwise connections, neglecting high-order dependencies among multiple entities and relations, and they treat structural and semantic signals independently, hindering effective cross-modal integration. To address these challenges, we propose MetaHGNIE, a meta-path induced hypergraph contrastive learning framework for disentangling and aligning structural and semantic information. MetaHGNIE constructs a higher-order knowledge graph via meta-path sequences, where typed hyperedges capture multi-entity relational contexts. Structural dependencies are aggregated with local attention, while semantic representations are encoded through a hypergraph transformer equipped with sparse chunking to reduce redundancy. Finally, a multimodal fusion module integrates structural and semantic embeddings under contrastive learning with auxiliary supervision, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark NIE datasets demonstrate that MetaHGNIE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics."}

In practice, multiphysics interactions such as diffusion, damage, and healing often take place on irregular meshes. We develop an operator-consistent graph neural network (OCGNN-PINN) that approximates PDE evolution under physics-informed constraints. It couples node-edge message passing with a consistency loss enforcing the gradient-divergence relation through the graph incidence matrix, ensuring that discrete node and edge dynamics remain structurally coupled during temporal rollout. We evaluate the model on diffusion processes over physically driven evolving meshes and real-world scanned surfaces. The results show improved temporal stability and prediction accuracy compared with graph convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines, approaching the performance of Crank-Nicolson solvers on unstructured domains."}

From a single causal requirement, namely causal consistency, together with sharp measurements, reversible symmetries, and no-signaling, we show that any admissible state-to-probability map must be affine under mixing; otherwise, its curvature enables superluminal signaling via steering. Using standard reconstruction results, affinity forces the probability assignment to coincide with the quadratic transition function of complex quantum theory. Our three-stage argument (operational assignment, causal-consistency constraints, and structural reconstruction) recovers complex quantum theory and identifies Born's rule as a causal fixed point among admissible probabilistic laws. We discuss limitations of the derivation and outline steering-based experiments that could bound deviations from affinity."}

Here, we show that artificial foragers equipped with learned world models naturally converge to MVT-aligned strategies. Using a model-based reinforcement learning agent that acquires a parsimonious predictive representation of its environment, we demonstrate that anticipatory capabilities, rather than reward maximization alone, drive efficient patch-leaving behavior. Compared with standard model-free RL agents, these model-based agents exhibit decision patterns similar to many of their biological counterparts, suggesting that predictive world models can serve as a foundation for more explainable and biologically grounded decision-making in AI systems.

By integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aerial base stations, and terrestrial base stations, LAINs can support mission-critical applications such as disaster response, environmental monitoring, and real-time sensing. However, these systems face key challenges, including energy-constrained UAVs, stochastic task arrivals, and heterogeneous computing resources. To address these issues, we propose an integrated air-ground collaborative network and formulate a time-dependent integer nonlinear programming problem that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning and task offloading decisions. The problem is challenging to solve due to temporal coupling among decision variables. Therefore, we design a hierarchical learning framework with two timescales. At the large timescale, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism enables the energy-aware and incentive-compatible trajectory assignment. At the small timescale, we propose the diffusion-heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization, a generative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that embeds latent diffusion models into actor networks. Each UAV samples actions from a Gaussian prior and refines them via observation-conditioned denoising, enhancing adaptability and policy diversity.

While frame-change maps and frame-invariant resource sums are theoretically understood, their impact on circuit-based quantum information processing has largely remained unexplored. We formulate QRF transformations as circuit compilation rules and, for systems with finite Abelian symmetry described by the regular representation, derive a gate-level dictionary that maps local operations in one frame to their images in another. This yields a group-theoretic classification of gates where symmetry-commuting operators remain local, up to frame-dependent phases, while generic gates are promoted to controlled entangling operations in which the original frame acts as a control register. The resulting frame-dependence entangling-gate count defines a relational circuit complexity where the cost of a computation depends on the internal reference frame of the observer. We instantiate the framework in a three-qubit model and show that the QRF unitary acts as a lossless converter between a purity-based local coherence and concurrence, preserving their invariant sum and giving a concrete realization of the relativity of entanglement. We implement the corresponding circuits on an IBM Quantum superconducting platform, using full state tomography to reconstruct the redistribution of resources between internal frames. The hardware data reproduce the predicted conversion of local coherence into entanglement, and the observed deviations from exact conservation quantify the effect of realistic device noise on relational quantum protocols."}

This is particularly critical in high-stakes operational contexts like supply chain management. To address this, we investigate the decision-making patterns of leading LLMs using the canonical newsvendor problem in a dynamic setting, aiming to identify the nature and origins of their cognitive biases. Methodology/results: Through dynamic, multi-round experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-8B, we tested for five established decision biases. We found that LLMs consistently replicated the classic ``Too Low/Too High'' ordering bias and significantly amplified other tendencies like demand-chasing behavior compared to human benchmarks. Our analysis uncovered a ``paradox of intelligence'': the more sophisticated GPT-4 demonstrated the greatest irrationality through overthinking, while the efficiency-optimized GPT-4o performed near-optimally. Because these biases persist even when optimal formulas are provided, we conclude they stem from architectural constraints rather than knowledge gaps. Managerial implications: First, managers should select models based on the specific task, as our results show that efficiency-optimized models can outperform more complex ones on certain optimization problems. Second, the significant amplification of bias by LLMs highlights the urgent need for robust human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes decisions to prevent costly errors. Third, our findings suggest that designing structured, rule-based prompts is a practical and effective strategy for managers to constrain models' heuristic tendencies and improve the reliability of AI-assisted decisions."}

We unify these within a single explanatory framework, the geometry of the loss and error landscapes. We analytically show that phase transitions in DNN learning are governed by saddle points in the loss landscape. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple, fast, and easy to implement algorithm that uses the L2 regularizer as a tool to probe the geometry of error landscapes. We apply it to confirm mode connectivity in DNNs trained on the MNIST dataset by efficiently finding paths that connect global minima. We then show numerically that saddle points induce transitions between models that encode distinct digit classes.

Offline benchmarks using static, single path annotated datasets unfairly penalize valid alternative actions, while online benchmarks suffer from poor scalability and reproducibility due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of live evaluation. Second, existing benchmarks treat agents as monolithic black boxes, overlooking the contributions of individual components, which often leads to unfair comparisons or obscures key performance bottlenecks.

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output. Comparative evaluations were performed on three cases: a 5-variable analytical function, a 5-variable wind-turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case, where ICE-based sensitivity was benchmarked against PDP, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Sobol' indices. The results show that ICE-based feature importance provides richer insights than the traditional PDP-based approach, while visual interpretations from PDP, ICE, and SHAP complement one another by offering multiple perspectives."}

However, its worst-case robustness under a misalignment threat model--where a model might learn to actively conceal its internal states--remains untested. Focusing on this threat model, we ask: could a model learn to evade previously unseen activation monitors? Our core contribution is to stress-test the learnability of this behavior. We demonstrate that finetuning can create Neural Chameleons: models capable of zero-shot evading activation monitors. Specifically, we fine-tune an LLM to evade monitors for a set of benign concepts (e.g., languages, HTML) when conditioned on a trigger of the form: \"You are being probed for {concept}\". We show that this learned mechanism generalizes zero-shot: by substituting {concept} with a safety-relevant term like 'deception', the model successfully evades previously unseen safety monitors. We validate this phenomenon across diverse model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), showing that the evasion succeeds even against monitors trained post hoc on the model's frozen weights. This evasion is highly selective, targeting only the specific concept mentioned in the trigger, and having a modest impact on model capabilities on standard benchmarks. Using Gemma-2-9b-it as a case study, a mechanistic analysis reveals this is achieved via a targeted manipulation that moves activations into a low-dimensional subspace. While stronger defenses like monitor ensembles and non-linear classifiers show greater resilience, the model retains a non-trivial evasion capability. Our work provides a proof-of-concept for this failure mode and a tool to evaluate the worst-case robustness of monitoring techniques against misalignment threat models."}

Moreover, validation on IBM Quantum hardware backends confirms the feasibility of our approach on real devices, with outcomes consistent with simulation. These findings position quantum fidelity as a powerful criterion for anomaly detection and highlight FiD-QAE as a promising direction that complements existing classical and quantum approaches, offering robustness and generalizability for financial fraud detection in realistic environments."}

Misinterpreting intent or risks may lead to unsafe outputs, while overly cautious interpretations can cause unnecessary refusal of benign requests. In this paper, we question the conventional framework in which LLMs generate immediate responses to requests without considering broader contextual factors. User requests are situated within broader contexts such as intentions, knowledge, and prior experience, which strongly influence what constitutes an appropriate answer. We propose a framework that extracts and leverages such contextual information from the user prompt itself. Specifically, a reinforcement learning based context generator, designed in an autoencoder-like fashion, is trained to infer contextual signals grounded in the prompt and use them to guide response generation. This approach is particularly important for safety tasks, where ambiguous requests may bypass safeguards while benign but confusing requests can trigger unnecessary refusals. Experiments show that our method reduces harmful responses by an average of 5.6% on the SafetyInstruct dataset across multiple foundation models and improves the harmonic mean of attack success rate and compliance on benign prompts by 6.2% on XSTest and WildJailbreak.

Project page: https://kagnlp.github.io/WebOperator/", "summary": "LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator.

Our architecture combines hardware-optimized parametric quantum circuits with a lightweight classical projection layer, utilizing a multi-sample SPSA strategy to efficiently train quantum parameters despite hardware noise. To characterize the capabilities of these models, we introduce a synthetic dataset designed to isolate syntactic dependencies in a controlled, low-resource environment. Experiments on IBM Quantum processors reveal the critical trade-offs between circuit depth and trainability, demonstrating that while noise remains a significant factor, observable-based readout enables the successful learning of sequential patterns on NISQ devices. These results establish a rigorous engineering baseline for generative quantum natural language processing, validating the feasibility of training complex sequence models on current quantum hardware."}

To bridge this gap, we propose SMART (Structural Mapping for Augmented Reinforcement Testing), a novel framework that synergizes structural verification and functional validation for game update testing. SMART leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret abstract syntax tree (AST) differences and extract functional intent, constructing a context-aware hybrid reward mechanism. This mechanism guides reinforcement learning agents to sequentially fulfill gameplay goals while adaptively exploring modified code branches. We evaluate SMART on two environments, Overcooked and Minecraft. The results demonstrate that SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; it achieves over 94% branch coverage of modified code, nearly double that of traditional reinforcement learning methods, while maintaining a 98% task completion rate, effectively balancing structural comprehensiveness with functional correctness."}

It is usually considered for the processing of quantum bits (qubits) and its efficient implementation is obtained with two elementary components: the Hadamard gate and the controlled--phase gate. In this paper, the quantum Fourier transform operating with continuous variables (cvQFT) is considered. Thus, the environment becomes the Hilbert space, where the natural definition of the cvQFT will be related to rotation operators, which in the $N$--mode are completely specified by unitary matrices of order $N$. Then the cvQFT is defined as the rotation operator whose rotation matrix is given by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. For the implementation of rotation operators with primitive components (single--mode rotations and beam splitters), we follow the well known Murnaghan procedure, with appropriate modifications. Moreover, algorithms related to the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are applied to reduce drastically the implementation complexity. The final part is concerned with the application of the cvQFT to general Gaussian states. In particular, we show that cvQFT has the simple effect of transforming the displacement vector by a one-dimensional DFT, the squeeze matrix by a two-dimensional DFT, and the rotation matrix by a Fourier-like similarity transform."}

My semantics offer a natural compromize in the long-standing debate between Pearl and Dawid over counterfactuals: I agree with Dawid that universal causal determinism and unrealistic variables should be rejected, but I agree with Pearl that a general semantics of counterfactuals is nonetheless possible. I restrict attention to causal models that satisfy the Markov condition, only contain realistic variables, and are causally complete. Although I formulate my proposal using structural causal models, as does Pearl, I refrain from using so-called response variables. Moreover, I prove that my semantics is equivalent to two other recent proposals that do not involve structural causal models, and that it is in line with various comments on stochastic counterfactuals that have appeared in the literature more broadly.

Our Safety Stability Index (SSI) reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce decision stability (Friedman chi-squared = 44.71, p < 0.001), with mean SSI dropping from 0.951 at temperature 0.0 to 0.896 at temperature 1.0. We validate our findings across all model families using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a unified external judge, achieving 89.0% inter-judge agreement with our primary Llama 70B judge (Cohen's kappa = 0.62). These findings demonstrate that single-shot safety evaluations are insufficient for reliable safety assessment.

Classical ILP systems operate over discrete predicates and typically rely on discretisation or hand-crafted numerical predicates, making it difficult to infer thresholds or arithmetic relations that must hold jointly across examples. Recent work has begun to address these limitations through tighter integrations of ILP with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or specialised numerical inference mechanisms. In this paper we investigate a modular alternative that couples the ILP system PyGol with the SMT solver Z3. Candidate clauses proposed by PyGol are interpreted as quantifier-free formulas over background theories such as linear or nonlinear real arithmetic, allowing numerical parameters to be instantiated and verified by the SMT solver while preserving ILP's declarative relational bias. This supports the induction of hybrid rules that combine symbolic predicates with learned numerical constraints, including thresholds, intervals, and multi-literal arithmetic relations. We formalise this SMT-ILP setting and evaluate it on a suite of synthetic datasets designed to probe linear, relational, nonlinear, and multi-hop reasoning. The results illustrate how a modular SMT-ILP architecture can extend the expressivity of symbolic rule learning, complementing prior numerical ILP approaches while providing a flexible basis for future extensions toward richer theory-aware induction."}

However, the evolution of quantum coherence for light beams undergoing fundamental optical processes at dielectric interfaces remains unexplored. Furthermore, manipulating multiphoton correlations typically requires complex interactions that challenge few-photon level implementation. Here, we introduce a quantum van Cittert-Zernike theorem for light beams, describing how their coherence-polarization properties are influenced by reflection and refraction, as well as how these properties evolve upon subsequent propagation. Our work demonstrates that the quantum statistics of photonic systems can be controllably modified through the inherent polarization coupling arising from reflection and refraction at an interface, without relying on conventional light-matter interactions. Our approach reveals regimes where thermal light can exhibit sub-Poissonian statistics with fluctuations below the shot-noise level through post-selected measurements, and this statistical property can be tuned by the incident angle. Remarkably, this quantum statistical modification is governed by a scaling law linking beam collimation to far-field thermalization. Our work establishes a robust, decoherence-avoiding mechanism for quantum state control, advancing the fundamental understanding of coherence in quantum optics and opening new avenues for applications in quantum information and metrology."}

We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance."}

To address this, we propose a Predictor-Corrector mechanism where the Predictor is any learned time-series model and the Corrector is a neural controlled differential equation. The Predictor forecasts, and the Corrector predicts the errors of the forecasts. Adding these errors to the forecasts improves forecast performance. The proposed Corrector works with irregularly sampled time series and continuous- and discrete-time Predictors. Additionally, we introduce two regularization strategies to improve the extrapolation performance of the Corrector with accelerated training. We evaluate our Corrector with diverse Predictors, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations, Contiformer, and DLinear, on synthetic, physics simulation, and real-world forecasting datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the Predictor-Corrector mechanism consistently improves the performance compared to Predictor alone."}

Prior work has primarily explored effective ways for a teacher to instruct the student, where the teacher identifies student gaps and provides guidance. In this work, we shift the focus to the student and investigate effective strategies to actively query the teacher in seeking useful information. Across math and coding benchmarks, where baseline student models begin with near-zero performance, we show that student-led approaches consistently yield absolute Pass@k improvements of at least 0.5 over static baselines.

Predominant research efforts focus on end-to-end generation schemes to generate co-speech gestures, spanning GANs, VQ-VAE, and recent diffusion models. As an ill-posed problem, in this paper, we argue that these prevailing learning schemes fail to model crucial inter- and intra-correlations across different motion units, i.e. head, body, and hands, thus leading to unnatural movements and poor coordination. To delve into these intrinsic correlations, we propose a unified Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity (HIP) learning approach for audio-inspired 3D gesture generation. Different from predominant research, our approach models this multi-modal implicit relationship by two explicit technique insights: i) To disentangle the complicated gesture movements, we first explore the gesture motion phase manifolds with periodic autoencoders to imitate human natures from realistic distributions while incorporating non-period ones from current latent states for instance-level diversities. ii) To model the hierarchical relationship of face motions, body gestures, and hand movements, driving the animation with cascaded guidance during learning. We exhibit our proposed approach on 3D avatars and extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art co-speech gesture generation methods by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

They predicted that quantum paths exhibit a universal Hausdorff dimension that transitions from $d=2$ to $d=1$ as the momentum of the particle increases. However, although measurements were assumed to occur at intervals of time, the calculations only involved evaluating the expectation value of operators for the free evolution of wave function within a single interval, with no actual physical measurements performed. In this work we investigate how quantum measurements alter the fractal geometry of quantum particle paths. By modelling sequential measurements using Gaussian wave packets for both the particle and the apparatus, we reveal that the dynamics of the measurement change the roughness of the path and shift the emergent Hausdorff dimension towards a lower value in nonselective evolution. For selective evolution, feedback control forces must be introduced to counteract stochastic wave function collapse, stabilising trajectories and enabling dimensionality to be tuned. When the contribution of the measurement approaches zero, our result reduces to that of Abbott et al. Our work can thus be regarded as a more realistic formulation of their approach, and it connects theoretical quantum fractality with measurement physics, quantifying how detectors reshape spacetime statistics at quantum scales."}

Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms."}

Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance."}

A hierarchy of separable neural quantum states is trained on finite-shot local Pauli outcomes and compared against an unconstrained reference model trained on the same data. When all constrained models are statistically disfavored, the data certify entanglement beyond the imposed limit directly from measurement statistics, without reconstructing the density matrix.

However, current implementations rely on recurrent Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) backbones and single-step training objectives, which limit their ability to capture long-range dependencies and produce coherent forecast trajectories across lead times. To address these limitations, we developed HydroDiffusion, a diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework with a decoder-only state space model backbone. The proposed framework jointly denoises full multi-day trajectories in a single pass, ensuring temporal coherence and mitigating error accumulation common in autoregressive prediction. HydroDiffusion is evaluated across 531 watersheds in the contiguous United States (CONUS) in the CAMELS dataset. We benchmark HydroDiffusion against two diffusion baselines with LSTM backbones, as well as the recently proposed Diffusion-based Runoff Model (DRUM). Results show that HydroDiffusion achieves strong nowcast accuracy when driven by observed meteorological forcings, and maintains consistent performance across the full simulation horizon. Moreover, HydroDiffusion delivers stronger deterministic and probabilistic forecast skill than DRUM in operational forecasting. These results establish HydroDiffusion as a robust generative modeling framework for medium-range streamflow forecasting, providing both a new modeling benchmark and a foundation for future research on probabilistic hydrologic prediction at continental scales."}

This leads to slow and unstable convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO), a new framework that incorporates hint-guided reflection into the DPO paradigm. RPO uses external models to identify hallucination sources and generate concise reflective hints, enabling the construction of on-policy preference pairs with stronger contrastiveness and clearer preference signals. We theoretically show that conditioning on hints increases the expected preference margin through mutual information and improves sample efficiency while remaining within the policy distribution family. Empirically, RPO achieves superior alignment with fewer training samples and iterations, substantially reducing hallucination rates and delivering state-of-the-art performance across multimodal benchmarks."}

However, there is currently a lack of high-quality datasets specifically designed to evaluate the ability of large multi-modal models (LMMs) to discover medical insights. In this paper, we introduce MedInsightBench, the first benchmark that comprises 332 carefully curated medical cases, each annotated with thoughtfully designed insights. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations. Our analysis indicates that existing LMMs exhibit limited performance on MedInsightBench, which is primarily attributed to their challenges in extracting multi-step, deep insights and the absence of medical expertise. Therefore, we propose MedInsightAgent, an automated agent framework for medical data analysis, composed of three modules: Visual Root Finder, Analytical Insight Agent, and Follow-up Question Composer. Experiments on MedInsightBench highlight pervasive challenges and demonstrate that MedInsightAgent can improve the performance of general LMMs in medical data insight discovery."}

EEG-DLite begins by encoding EEG segments into compact latent representations using a self-supervised autoencoder, allowing sample selection to be performed efficiently and with reduced sensitivity to noise. Based on these representations, EEG-DLite filters out outliers and minimizes redundancy, resulting in a smaller yet informative subset that retains the diversity essential for effective foundation model training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training on only 5 percent of a 2,500-hour dataset curated with EEG-DLite yields performance comparable to, and in some cases better than, training on the full dataset across multiple downstream tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of pre-training data distillation in the context of EEG foundation models.

Here, we investigate effects of including nondipole terms in the light-matter coupling in simulations of HHG in materials with both topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. We show how the inclusion of nondipole terms breaks dipole selection rules, allowing for new polarizations of the generated light. Specifically we find that helicity, completely absent in the dipole approximation, is induced by the nondipole extension, and that this helicity is dependent on the topological phase of the material."}

While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics."}

This study investigates how LLMs internally represent combinatorial optimization problems and whether such representations can support downstream decision tasks. We adopt a twofold methodology combining direct querying, which assesses LLM capacity to explicitly extract instance features, with probing analyses that examine whether such information is implicitly encoded within their hidden layers. The probing framework is further extended to a per-instance algorithm selection task, evaluating whether LLM-derived representations can predict the best-performing solver. Experiments span four benchmark problems and three instance representations. Results show that LLMs exhibit moderate ability to recover feature information from problem instances, either through direct querying or probing. Notably, the predictive power of LLM hidden-layer representations proves comparable to that achieved through traditional feature extraction, suggesting that LLMs capture meaningful structural information relevant to optimization performance."}

We release our code and model at https://github.com/sitaocheng/DERL", "summary": "The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the \"meta-gradient\" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention."}

In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography."}

As large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on behalf of humans in collaborative and competitive workflows, there is a pressing need to evaluate whether and under what conditions they exhibit envy-like preferences. In this paper, we test whether LLMs show envy-like behavior toward each other. We considered two scenarios: (1) A point allocation game that tests whether a model tries to win over its peer. (2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains.

A lightweight GRU aggregates the globally contextualized patch tokens for direct multi-horizon prediction. The resulting architecture achieves linear $O(kLd)$ time and memory complexity. On eight real-world benchmarking datasets from six different domains, including weather, stock price, temperature, power consumption, electricity, and disease, and forecasting horizons $96-720$, TwinFormer secures $27$ positions in the top two out of $34$. Out of the $27$, it achieves the best performance on MAE and RMSE at $17$ places and $10$ at the second-best place on MAE and RMSE. This consistently outperforms PatchTST, iTransformer, FEDformer, Informer, and vanilla Transformers.

To address this gap, we propose MedCEG, a framework that augments medical language models with clinically valid reasoning pathways by explicitly supervising the reasoning process through a Critical Evidence Graph (CEG). We curate a dataset of challenging clinical cases and algorithmically construct a CEG for each sample to represent a high-quality verifiable reasoning pathway. To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a Clinical Reasoning Procedure Reward, which evaluates Node Coverage, Structural Correctness, and Chain Completeness, thereby providing a holistic assessment of reasoning quality.

However, this is a challenging task as it requires higher nonlinearity or larger Fock states. In this article, we surmount this necessity by using a linear optical setup with a cascaded arrangement of beam splitters that relies solely on single photon sources and single photon detectors to tailor desired single mode nonclassical states. To show the utility of this setup, we demonstrate the generation of displaced higher photon states with unit fidelity and the family of Schrodinger cat states above $98\\%$ fidelity. In addition, we manifest the generation of GKP resource states, such as ON states and weak cubic phase states with $99\\%$ fidelity. Creating such a variety of important states in this single setup is made feasible by stating the output in the form of displaced qudits. This figure of merit facilitates efficient identification and optimization of input parameters required to generate the target single mode quantum states. We also account for the experimental imperfections by incorporating detector inefficiencies and non-unit single photon sources. This cascaded setup will assist the experimentalists to explore the feasible creation of target states using currently available resources, such as single photon sources and single photon detectors."}

We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control. Overall, reusable value profiles provide a tractable computational account of belief-conditioned value control in volatile environments and yield testable signatures of belief-dependent control and behavioral flexibility."}

To this end, we use a flexible family of uncertainty measures that distinguishes between total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty of second-order distributions. These measures can be instantiated with specific loss functions, so-called proper scoring rules, to control their characteristics, and we show that different characteristics are useful for different tasks. In particular, we show that, for the task of selective prediction, the scoring rule should ideally match the task loss. On the other hand, for out-of-distribution detection, our results confirm that mutual information, a widely used measure of epistemic uncertainty, performs best. Furthermore, in an active learning setting, epistemic uncertainty based on zero-one loss is shown to consistently outperform other uncertainty measures."}

Although a quantum-assisted hierarchical fuzzy neural network (QA-HFNN) was proposed to learn fuzzy membership for each feature, it cannot model dependencies between features due to its single-qubit encoding. To address this, this paper proposes a dual-qubit hierarchical fuzzy neural network (DQ-HFNN), encoding feature pairs onto a pair of entangled qubits, which extends the single-feature fuzzy model to a joint fuzzy representation. By introducing quantum entanglement, the dual-qubit circuit can encode non-classical correlations, enabling the model to directly learn relationship patterns between feature pairs. Experiments on benchmarks show that DQ-HFNN demonstrates higher classification accuracy than QA-HFNN, as well as classical deep learning baselines. Furthermore, ablation studies after controlling for circuit depth and parameter counts show that the performance gain mainly stems from the relational modeling capability enabled by entanglement rather than enhanced expressivity. The proposed DQ-HFNN model exhibits high parameter efficiency and fast inference speed. Experiments under noisy conditions suggest that it is robust against noise and has the potential to be implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices."}

Results show consistent improvements in SEC-domain validation loss for both models, with the largest gains occurring within the first 200M tokens and diminishing returns thereafter. Power-law fits reveal shallow exponents, indicating that financial language is highly regular and efficiently learnable under continued pretraining. General-domain validation loss remains effectively unchanged across all token budgets, suggesting minimal drift and no signs of catastrophic forgetting. A data-efficiency frontier further shows that both models move toward improved specialization with negligible mixed-domain degradation.

Our study reveals the essential contribution of coherent feedback in the thermal bath's input-noise operators, resulting in the system being driven far from thermal equilibrium.

However, current adaptations of GRPO for the flow matching-based image generation neglect a foundational conflict between its core principles and the distinct dynamics of the visual synthesis process. This mismatch leads to two key limitations: (i) Uniformly applying a sparse terminal reward across all timesteps impairs temporal credit assignment, ignoring the differing criticality of generation phases from early structure formation to late-stage tuning. (ii) Exclusive reliance on relative, intra-group rewards causes the optimization signal to fade as training converges, leading to the optimization stagnation when reward diversity is entirely depleted. To address these limitations, we propose Value-Anchored Group Policy Optimization (VGPO), a framework that redefines value estimation across both temporal and group dimensions. Specifically, VGPO transforms the sparse terminal reward into dense, process-aware value estimates, enabling precise credit assignment by modeling the expected cumulative reward at each generative stage. Furthermore, VGPO replaces standard group normalization with a novel process enhanced by absolute values to maintain a stable optimization signal even as reward diversity declines. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that VGPO achieves state-of-the-art image quality while simultaneously improving task-specific accuracy, effectively mitigating reward hacking.

Recent advances in patch-based Transformer models have shown strong potential in various time series forecasting tasks. However, most existing methods rely on fixed-size patch embedding, making it difficult to model the complex and heterogeneous patterns of airport passenger flows. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deformable temporal-spectral transformer named DTSFormer that integrates a multiscale deformable partitioning module and a joint temporal-spectral filtering module. Specifically, the input sequence is dynamically partitioned into multiscale temporal patches via a novel window function-based masking, enabling the extraction of heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages. Then, within each scale, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to capture both high- and low-frequency components, thereby emphasizing the volatility and periodicity inherent in airport passenger flows. Finally, the resulting multi-frequency features are subsequently fused in the time domain to jointly model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world passenger flow data collected at Beijing Capital International Airport from January 2023 to March 2024. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across different prediction horizons. Further analysis shows that the deformable partitioning module aligns patch lengths with dominant periods and heterogeneous trends, enabling superior capture of sudden high-frequency fluctuations."}

Quantum nonlocality sharing provides a crucial strategy for the resource-efficient recycling of quantum correlations, offering a promising pathway toward scaling quantum networks. Despite its potential, the limited availability of resources introduces a fundamental trade-off between the number of sharable network branches and the achievable sequential sharing rounds. The relationship between available entanglement and the sharing capacity remains largely unexplored, which constrains the efficient design and scalability of quantum networks. Here, we establish the entanglement threshold required to support unbounded sharing across an entire network by introducing a protocol based on probabilistic projective measurements. When resources fall below this threshold, we derive an achievable trade-off between the number of sharable branches and sharing rounds. To assess practical feasibility, we compare the detectability of our protocol with weak-measurement schemes and extend the sharing protocol to realistic noise models, providing a robust framework for nonlocality recycling in quantum networks."}

Information enters as a resource when considering feedback-controlled thermal machines.

Here, we present a framework for a generic, two-stroke quantum heat engine interacting with $N$ thermal baths and Maxwell's demon. The demon performs projective measurements on the engine working substance, the outcome of which is recorded in a classical memory, embedded in its own thermal bath. To perform feedback control, the demon enacts unitary operations on the working substance, conditioned on the recorded outcome. By considering the compound machine-memory as a hybrid (classical-quantum) standard thermal machine interacting with $N+1$ thermal baths, our framework puts the working substance and memory on equal footing, thereby enabling a comprehensible resolution to Maxwell's paradox. We illustrate the application of our framework with a two-qubit engine. A remarkable observation is that more information does not necessarily result in better thermodynamic performance: sometimes knowing less is better."}

This study leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to automate actuator settings for optimal greenhouse management. To enhance interpretability and trust in the model decision-making process, both local and global explanation techniques were employed using model-inherent interpretation, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley additive explanations (SHAP). These explainability methods provide information on how different sensor readings, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, light, and outer climate, contribute to actuator control decisions in an automated greenhouse. The trained TFT model achieved a test accuracy of 95% on a class-imbalanced dataset for actuator control settings in an automated greenhouse environment. The results demonstrate the varying influence of each sensor on real-time greenhouse adjustments, ensuring transparency and enabling adaptive fine-tuning for improved crop yield and resource efficiency."}

This paper introduces a novel system for real-time feedback on near-failure states (RiR $\\le$ 2) during resistance exercise using only a single wrist-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We propose a two-stage pipeline suitable for edge deployment: first, a ResNet-based model segments repetitions from the 6-axis IMU data in real-time. Second, features derived from this segmentation, alongside direct convolutional features and historical context captured by an LSTM, are used by a classification model to identify exercise windows corresponding to near-failure states. Using a newly collected dataset from 13 diverse participants performing preacher curls to failure (631 total reps), our segmentation model achieved an F1 score of 0.83, and the near-failure classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.82 under simulated real-time evaluation conditions (1.6 Hz inference rate).

However, in the context of controlling ``chaotic'' quantum unitary dynamics, the situation is far more tenuous. The classical concepts of exponential sensitivity to trajectory initial conditions and ergodicity do not directly translate into quantum unitary evolution. Nevertheless properties inherent to quantum chaos can take on those roles: i) the dynamical sensitivity to weak perturbations, measured by the fidelity decay, serves a similar purpose as the classical sensitivity to initial conditions; and ii) paired with the fact that quantum chaotic systems are conjectured to be statistically described by random matrix theory, implies a method to translate the ergodic feature into the control of quantum dynamics. With those two properties, it can be argued that quantum chaotic dynamical systems, in principle, allow for full controllability beyond a characteristic time that scales only logarithmically with system size and $\\hbar^{-1}$. In the spirit of classical targeting, it implies that it is possible to fine tune the immense quantum interference with weak perturbations and steer the system from any initial state into any desired target state, subject to constraints imposed by conserved quantities. In contrast, integrable dynamics possess neither ergodicity nor exponential instability, and thus the weak perturbations apparently must break the integrability for control purposes. The main ideas are illustrated with the quantum kicked rotor. The production of revivals, cat-like entangled states, and the transition from any random state to any other random state is possible as demonstrated."}

However, recent work suggests that relying on approximate symmetry can offer greater flexibility and robustness. Despite promising empirical evidence, there has been little theoretical understanding, and in particular, a direct comparison between exact and approximate symmetry is missing from the literature. In this paper, we initiate this study by asking: What is the cost of enforcing exact versus approximate symmetry? To address this question, we introduce averaging complexity, a framework for quantifying the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. Our main result is an exponential separation: under standard conditions, achieving exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, whereas approximate symmetry can be attained with only logarithmic averaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first theoretical separation of these two cases, formally justifying why approximate symmetry may be preferable in practice. Beyond this, our tools and techniques may be of independent interest for the broader study of symmetries in machine learning."}

In numerical experiments we study examples where we observe for a 1D Ising chain with nearest-neighbor interactions that the RGD steps needed to prepare a ground state scales linearly with the number of spins. For all-to-all couplings a quadratic scaling is obtained. To achieve efficient implementations while keeping convergence guarantees, we develop RGD approximations by randomly projecting the Riemannian gradient into polynomial-sized subspaces. We find that the speed of convergence of the randomly projected RGD critically depends on the size of the subspace the gradient is projected into. Finally, we develop efficient quantum device implementations based on Trotterization and a quantum stochastic drift-inspired protocol.

However, achieving efficient GNN inference on edge devices poses significant challenges, limiting their application in real-world edge scenarios. This is due to the high computational cost of GNNs and limited hardware resources on edge devices, which prevent GNN inference from meeting real-time and energy requirements. As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs. To address this, we propose GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN architecture-mapping Co-design and deployment on Device-Edge hierarchies. By abstracting the device communication process into an explicit operation, GCoDE fuses the architecture and mapping scheme in a unified design space for joint optimization. Additionally, GCoDE's system performance awareness enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency across diverse heterogeneous systems. By analyzing the energy consumption of various GNN operations, GCoDE introduces an energy prediction method that improves energy assessment accuracy and identifies energy-efficient solutions. Using a constraint-based random search strategy, GCoDE identifies the optimal solution in 1.5 hours, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the integrated co-inference engine in GCoDE enables efficient deployment and execution of GNN co-inference.

Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models."}

Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities.

To make this paradigm tractable, TM employs a large backbone network and a smaller \"head\" module to efficiently execute the generative transition step. In this work, we present a large-scale, systematic investigation into the design, training and sampling of the head in TM frameworks, focusing on its time-continuous bidirectional variant.

Most previous studies have focused on the single-particle case in the far-field regime, where both approaches yield very similar arrival-time distributions and a semi-classical analysis typically suffices. Recent advances in atom-optics technologies now make it possible to experimentally investigate arrival-time distributions for entangled multi-particle systems in the near-field regime, where a deeper analysis beyond semi-classical approximations is required. Even in the far-field regime, due to quantum non-locality, the semi-classical approximation cannot generally hold in multi-particle systems. Therefore, in this work, two fundamental approaches to the arrival-time problem -- namely, the time-parameter and time-operator approaches -- are extended to multi-particle systems. Using these extensions, we propose a feasible two-particle arrival-time experiment and numerically evaluate the corresponding joint distributions. Our results reveal regimes in which the two approaches yield inequivalent predictions, highlighting conditions under which experiments could shed new light on distinguishing between competing accounts of time in quantum mechanics.

Training combines activation normalization, a separation regularizer, and anchor or subspace regularizers that attract rare labeled examples to predefined directions or axis-aligned subspaces. The anchored geometry enables two practical interventions: reversible behavioral steering that projects out a concept's latent component at inference, and permanent removal via targeted weight ablation of anchored dimensions. Experiments on structured autoencoders show selective attenuation of targeted concepts with negligible impact on orthogonal features, and complete elimination with reconstruction error approaching theoretical bounds.

It generalizes its classical counterpart by extending the concept beyond temperature equilibration. This paper approaches the QME in Markovian open quantum systems from different perspectives. First, we propose a physical mechanism based on decoherence-free subspaces. Second, we show that an exponential enhancement of the decay rate toward equilibrium, scaling with system size, can be obtained, leading to an extreme version of the phenomenon in Markovian open quantum systems. Third, we study the strong Mpemba effect through the unravelings of Davies maps, revealing subtleties in the choice of figures of merit used to identify the QME.

Unlike ESAN's bag-based representation, GoMS constructs a graph where nodes represent subgraphs and edges capture their structural relationships, preserving critical topological information about how substructures are connected and overlap within the molecule. Through extensive experiments on public molecular datasets, we demonstrate that GoMS outperforms ESAN and other baseline methods, with particularly improvements for large molecules containing more than 100 atoms. The performance gap widens as molecular size increases, demonstrating GoMS's effectiveness for modeling industrial-scale molecules. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GoMS can distinguish molecules with identical subgraph compositions but different spatial arrangements.

By integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aerial base stations, and terrestrial base stations, LAINs can support mission-critical applications such as disaster response, environmental monitoring, and real-time sensing. However, these systems face key challenges, including energy-constrained UAVs, stochastic task arrivals, and heterogeneous computing resources. To address these issues, we propose an integrated air-ground collaborative network and formulate a time-dependent integer nonlinear programming problem that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning and task offloading decisions. The problem is challenging to solve due to temporal coupling among decision variables. Therefore, we design a hierarchical learning framework with two timescales. At the large timescale, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism enables the energy-aware and incentive-compatible trajectory assignment. At the small timescale, we propose the diffusion-heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization, a generative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that embeds latent diffusion models into actor networks. Each UAV samples actions from a Gaussian prior and refines them via observation-conditioned denoising, enhancing adaptability and policy diversity.

For that purpose, dequantization algorithms play a central role in providing a clear theoretical framework to separate the complexity of quantum and classical algorithms. However, existing dequantized algorithms typically rely on sampling procedures, leading to prohibitively large computational overheads and hindering their practical implementation on classical computers. In this work, we propose a tensor network-based dequantization framework for GSEE that eliminates the sampling process while preserving the asymptotic complexity of prior dequantized algorithms. In our formulation, the overhead arising from sampling is replaced by the growth of the bond dimension required to represent Chebyshev vectors as tensor network states. Consequently, physical structure, such as entanglement and locality, is naturally reflected in the computational cost. By combining this approach with tensor network approximations, such as Matrix Product States (MPS), we construct a practical dequantization algorithm that is executable within realistic computational resources. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method can efficiently construct high-degree polynomials up to $d=10^4$ for Hamiltonians with up to $100$ qubits, explicitly revealing the crossover between classically tractable and quantum advantaged regimes. These results indicate that tensor network-based dequantization provides a crucial tool toward the rigorous, quantitative verification of quantum advantage in realistic many-body systems."}

Although the current allocation policy was recently revised in 2018, a major concern is that it does not adequately take into account pretransplant and post-transplant mortality. In this paper, we take an important step toward addressing these deficiencies.\n  To begin with, we use historical data from UNOS to develop a new simulator that enables us to evaluate and compare the performance of different policies. We then leverage our simulator to demonstrate that the status quo policy is considerably inferior to the myopic policy that matches incoming donors to the patient who maximizes the number of years gained by the transplant. Moreover, we develop improved policies that account for the dynamic nature of the allocation process through the use of potentials -- a measure of a patient's utility in future allocations that we introduce. We also show that batching together even a handful of donors -- which is a viable option for a certain type of donors -- further enhances performance. Our simulator also allows us to evaluate the effect of critical, and often unexplored, factors in the allocation, such as geographic proximity and the tendency to reject offers by the transplant centers."}

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output. Comparative evaluations were performed on three cases: a 5-variable analytical function, a 5-variable wind-turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case, where ICE-based sensitivity was benchmarked against PDP, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Sobol' indices.

Code available at https://github.com/ShanechiLab/BaRISTA", "summary": "Intracranial recordings have opened a unique opportunity to simultaneously measure activity across multiregional networks in the human brain. Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance."}

We prove that in the transductive setting, the mistake bound is at least $Ω(\\sqrt{d})$. This constitutes an exponential improvement over previous lower bounds of $Ω(\\log\\log d)$, $Ω(\\sqrt{\\log d})$, and $Ω(\\log d)$, due respectively to Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1995, 1997) and Hanneke, Moran, and Shafer (2023).

Our upper bound also improves upon the best known upper bound of $(2/3)d$ from Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1997).

First, they rely on global strong convexity assumptions which are often not satisfied in practice. Second, the resulting bounds scale very poorly with the number of parameters ($d$) and the number of samples removed ($k$).

We consider a bosonic model with two phase-shift parameters and analyze the performance of second- and third-order nonlinear scrambling using two classes of probe states: squeezed vacuum states and coherent states. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear scrambling mitigates sloppiness, increases compatibility, and improves overall estimation precision. We find third-order nonlinearity to be more effective than second-order under both fixed-probe and fixed-energy constraints. Furthermore, by comparing joint estimation to a stepwise estimation strategy, we show that a threshold for nonlinear coupling exists. For coherent probes, joint estimation outperforms the stepwise strategy if the nonlinearity is sufficiently large, while for squeezed probes, this advantage is observed specifically with third-order nonlinearity."}

We augment the Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN) generator objective with a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)-inspired energy term computed from class-specific Ising Hamiltonians using Qiskit's EstimatorQNN and TorchConnector.\n  Important limitations: All experiments run on a noiseless statevector simulator with only 4 qubits, use a deliberately simple Hamiltonian parameterization, and lack ablation studies comparing against equivalent classical biases. The computational overhead (approximately 200x slower than classical ACGAN) reflects simulator artifacts rather than inherent quantum costs.\n  On MNIST, we observe that the energy-regularized model (termed QACGAN) achieves high classification accuracy (99 to 100 percent) within 5 epochs compared to 87.8 percent for ACGAN, suggesting the auxiliary term influences class conditioning. However, sample quality metrics (FID) show high variance across runs (coefficient of variation approximately 25 percent at epoch 5), with values ranging from 19.92 to 35.96. Extended runs stabilize around FID 23 to 24, comparable to the ACGAN baseline.\n  We explicitly do not claim quantum advantage, improved stability in any general sense, or scalability beyond this toy setting. The contribution is methodological: demonstrating that VQE-style energy computations can be integrated into GAN training loops via differentiable pathways. Whether such auxiliary signals provide benefits beyond equivalent classical regularizers remains an open question requiring systematic ablation studies, which we leave for future work."}

We point out that the relevant mechanism is not intrinsically field-theoretic, but is essentially a quantum tunneling/evanescent matter channel, which is already captured within ordinary quantum mechanics. More importantly, the microscopic constituents of realistic macroscopic objects are bound and localized by strong potentials, introducing a large internal energy scale that suppresses coherent propagation between distant bodies. Including such binding/localization generically yields an exponential suppression, rendering the matter-mediated contribution negligible at the macroscopic separations relevant to gravitational-entanglement proposals.

Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We show that quantum oracles provide an advantage over classical oracles for answering classical counterfactual questions in causal models, or equivalently, for identifying unknown causal parameters such as distributions over functional dependences. In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfactual questions, since different causal parameters can reproduce the same observational and interventional data while disagreeing on counterfactuals. Using a simple binary example, we demonstrate that if the classical variables of interest are encoded in quantum systems and the causal dependence among them is encoded in a quantum oracle, coherently querying the oracle enables the identification of all causal parameters -- hence all classical counterfactuals. We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles."}

Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities.

To make this paradigm tractable, TM employs a large backbone network and a smaller \"head\" module to efficiently execute the generative transition step. In this work, we present a large-scale, systematic investigation into the design, training and sampling of the head in TM frameworks, focusing on its time-continuous bidirectional variant.

Existing defenses face a scalability trilemma: distance-based filtering (e.g., Krum) can reject legitimate Non-IID updates, geometric-median methods incur prohibitive $O(n^2 d)$ cost, and many certified defenses are evaluated only on models below 100M parameters. We propose Spectral Sentinel, a Byzantine detection and aggregation framework that leverages a random-matrix-theoretic signature: honest Non-IID gradients produce covariance eigenspectra whose bulk follows the Marchenko-Pastur law, while Byzantine perturbations induce detectable tail anomalies. Our algorithm combines Frequent Directions sketching with data-dependent MP tracking, enabling detection on models up to 1.5B parameters using $O(k^2)$ memory with $k \\ll d$. Under a $(σ,f)$ threat model with coordinate-wise honest variance bounded by $σ^2$ and $f < 1/2$ adversaries, we prove $(ε,δ)$-Byzantine resilience with convergence rate $O(σf / \\sqrt{T} + f^2 / T)$, and we provide a matching information-theoretic lower bound $Ω(σf / \\sqrt{T})$, establishing minimax optimality.

Such transitions may be anticipated by the emergence of a low-dimensional order parameter, whose signature is often masked by high-amplitude stochastic variability. Standard contrastive learning approaches based on deep neural networks, while promising for detecting critical transitions, are often overparameterized and sensitive to irrelevant noise, leading to inaccurate identification of critical points. To address these limitations, we propose a neural network architecture, constructed using singular value decomposition technique, together with a strictly semi-orthogonality-constrained training algorithm, to enhance the performance of traditional contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method matches the performance of traditional contrastive learning techniques in identifying critical transitions, yet is considerably more lightweight and markedly more resistant to noise."}

Here, we present extensive numerical evidence that fluctuations in two-dimensional (2D) Anderson localization belongs to the (1+1)-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In turn, by adopting the KPZ framework, we gain fresh insight into the structure and phenomenology of Anderson localization itself. We analyze both localized eigenstates and time-evolved wave packets, demonstrating that the fluctuation of their logarithmic density follows the KPZ scaling. Moreover, we reveal that the internal structure of these eigenstates exhibits glassy features characteristic of the directed polymer problem, including the emergence of dominant paths together with pinning and avalanche behavior. Localization is not isotropic but organized along preferential branches of weaker confinement, corresponding to these dominant paths. For localized wave packets, we further demonstrate that their spatial profiles obey a stretched-exponential form consistent with the KPZ scaling, while remaining fully compatible with the single-parameter scaling (SPS) hypothesis, a cornerstone of Anderson localization theory. Altogether, our results establish a unified KPZ framework for describing fluctuations and microscopic organization in 2D Anderson localization, revealing the glassy nature of localized states and providing new understanding into the universal structure of disordered quantum systems."}

This work introduces a novel paradigm that uses surrogate models to create simpler, faster, and more flexible approximations of these dynamics. We propose two specific algorithms: SINDy Flow Matching (SINDy-FM), which leverages sparse regression to identify interpretable, symbolic differential equations from data, and a Neural-ODE reformulation of the Schrödinger Bridge (DSBM-NeuralODE) for flexible continuous-time parameterization. Our experiments on Gaussian transport tasks and MNIST latent translation demonstrate that these surrogates achieve competitive performance while offering dramatic improvements in efficiency and interpretability. The symbolic SINDy-FM models, in particular, reduce parameter counts by several orders of magnitude and enable near-instantaneous inference, paving the way for a new class of tractable and high-performing bridge models for practical deployment."}

In this work, we develop a unified framework that clarifies the origin of ETH by separating kinematic typicality from dynamical input. We show that the characteristic ETH structure of local operator matrix elements follows from four ingredients: the maximum entropy principle, the geometry of high-dimensional Hilbert space, the locality of physical observables, and a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP). ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable from typical states within a narrow microcanonical shell with respect to local measurements. Within this framework, diagonal ETH emerges from measure concentration, while the universal exponential suppression and smooth energy-frequency dependence of off-diagonal matrix elements arise from entropic scaling and local dynamical correlations, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, geometry, and chaos-induced typicality, and clarify its scope, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics."}

In this paper, we present Quantum Neural Radiance Fields (Q-NeRF), the first hybrid quantum-classical framework for neural radiance field rendering. Q-NeRF integrates QIREN modules into the Nerfacto backbone, preserving its efficient sampling, pose refinement, and volumetric rendering strategies while replacing selected density and radiance prediction components with quantum-enhanced counterparts. We systematically evaluate three hybrid configurations on standard multi-view indoor datasets, comparing them to classical baselines using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics. Results show that hybrid quantum-classical models achieve competitive reconstruction quality under limited computational resources, with quantum modules particularly effective in representing fine-scale, view-dependent appearance.

Many studies suggest that introducing the SFT stage not only fails to improve reasoning ability but may also negatively impact model training. In this study, we revisit this RL-centric belief through a systematic and controlled comparison of SFT and RL on VLM Reasoning. Using identical data sources, we find that the relative effectiveness of SFT and RL is conditional and strongly influenced by model capacity, data scale, and data distribution. Contrary to common assumptions, our findings show that SFT plays a crucial role across several scenarios: (1) Effectiveness for weaker models. SFT more reliably elicits reasoning capabilities in smaller or weaker VLMs. (2) Data efficiency. SFT with only 2K achieves comparable or better reasoning performance to RL with 20K. (3) Cross-modal transferability. SFT demonstrates stronger generalization across modalities. Moreover, we identify a pervasive issue of deceptive rewards, where higher rewards fail to correlate with better reasoning accuracy in RL. These results challenge the prevailing \"RL over SFT\" narrative. They highlight that the role of SFT may have been underestimated and support a more balanced post-training pipeline in which SFT and RL function as complementary components."}

A lightweight lambda-curriculum is adopted to stabilize training as the state expands from a risk-neutral reduced HJB to a risk-averse HJB. On the Gatheral-Schied single-asset model, MT-PINN aligns closely with their derived closed-form solutions and concentrates terminal inventory tightly around zero while reducing errors along optimal paths. We apply MT-PINNs on SPY intraday data, matching TWAP when risk-neutral, and achieving lower exposure and competitive costs, especially in falling windows, for higher risk-aversion."}

However, existing approaches focus primarily on computational savings, often overlooking the representational consequences of sparsification and leaving a noticeable performance gap compared to full models. In this work, we first reinterpret input sparsification as a form of dynamic structural pruning.

We investigate a potential topological constraint: when the prior distribution and target distribution have mismatched topology (e.g., unimodal to multimodal), the optimal velocity field under standard flow matching objectives may exhibit spatial discontinuities. We suggest that this discontinuity arises from the requirement that continuous flows must bifurcate to map a single mode to multiple modes, forcing particles to make discrete routing decisions at intermediate times. Through theoretical analysis on bimodal Gaussian mixtures, we demonstrate that the optimal velocity field exhibits jump discontinuities along decision boundaries, with magnitude approaching infinity as time approaches the target distribution. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to $L^2$ loss, but rather may be a consequence of topological mismatch between distributions. We validate our theory empirically and discuss potential implications for flow matching on manifolds, connecting our findings to recent work on Riemannian flow matching and the challenge of learning discontinuous representations in neural networks."}

Yet LLMs often exhibit variability when prompts are phrased with minor differences, even when semantically equivalent. Such inconsistency undermines trust, complicates compliance, and disrupts user experience. While personalization is desirable in certain contexts, many enterprise scenarios-such as HR onboarding, customer support, or policy disclosure-require invariant information delivery regardless of phrasing or prior conversational history. Existing approaches, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and temperature tuning, improve factuality or reduce stochasticity but cannot guarantee stability across equivalent prompts. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly optimize for consistency. Unlike prior applications of GRPO, which have been limited to reasoning and code generation, we adapt GRPO to enforce stability of information content across groups of semantically equivalent prompts. We introduce entropy-based helpfulness and stability rewards, treating prompt variants as groups and resetting conversational context to isolate phrasing effects. Experiments on investment and job recommendation tasks show that our GRPO-trained model reduces variability more effectively than fine-tuning or decoding-based baselines. To our knowledge, this is a novel application of GRPO for aligning LLMs toward information consistency, reframing variability not as an acceptable feature of generative diversity but as a correctable flaw in enterprise deployments."}

However, such models often rely on millions to billions of training sequences and billions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive computational costs and significant barriers to reproducibility and accessibility, particularly for academic labs. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of data pruning for BioFM pretraining and propose a post-hoc influence-guided data pruning framework tailored to biological domains. Our approach introduces a subset-based self-influence formulation that enables efficient estimation of sample importance at low computational cost, and builds upon it two simple yet effective selection strategies, namely Top-k Influence (Top I) and Coverage-Centric Influence (CCI). We empirically validate our method on two representative BioFMs, RNA-FM and ESM-C. For RNA, our framework consistently outperforms random selection baselines under an extreme pruning rate of over 99 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our framework on protein-related tasks using ESM-C.

We introduce a model-agnostic framework that captures the interaction between resource allocation, concept drift dynamics, and deployment timing. We show that optimal training policies depend critically on the aging properties of concept durations. Under sudden concept changes, we derive optimal training policies subject to budget constraints when concept durations follow distributions with Decreasing Mean Residual Life (DMRL), and show that intuitive heuristics are provably suboptimal under Increasing Mean Residual Life (IMRL). We further study model deployment under communication constraints, prove that the associated optimization problem is quasi-convex under mild conditions, and propose a randomized scheduling strategy that achieves near-optimal client-side performance.

To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro). With only 1K labeled and 3K unlabeled samples, TraPO reaches 42.6% average accuracy, surpassing the best unsupervised method trained on 45K unlabeled samples (38.3%).

We suggest that this discontinuity arises from the requirement that continuous flows must bifurcate to map a single mode to multiple modes, forcing particles to make discrete routing decisions at intermediate times. Through theoretical analysis on bimodal Gaussian mixtures, we demonstrate that the optimal velocity field exhibits jump discontinuities along decision boundaries, with magnitude approaching infinity as time approaches the target distribution. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to $L^2$ loss, but rather may be a consequence of topological mismatch between distributions. We validate our theory empirically and discuss potential implications for flow matching on manifolds, connecting our findings to recent work on Riemannian flow matching and the challenge of learning discontinuous representations in neural networks."}

However, SAC is notoriously difficult to combine with n-step returns, since their usual combination introduces bias in off-policy algorithms due to the changes in action distribution. While this problem is solved by importance sampling, a method for estimating expected values of one distribution using samples from another distribution, importance sampling may result in numerical instability. In this work, we combine SAC with n-step returns in a way that overcomes this issue. We present an approach to applying numerically stable importance sampling with simplified hyperparameter selection.

The framework formulates uncertainty control as a two-stage problem: the first stage selects confident samples for prediction, and the second stage applies conformal risk control on the selected subset to construct calibrated prediction sets. We develop two algorithms under this framework. The first, SCRC-T, preserves exchangeability by computing thresholds jointly over calibration and test samples, offering exact finite-sample guarantees. The second, SCRC-I, is a calibration-only variant that provides PAC-style probabilistic guarantees while being more computational efficient.

Our study focuses on masked feature reconstruction (MFR), a generative technique where a model learns to restore the raw features of masked nodes in a self-supervised manner. We observe that both MFR and graph contrastive learning (GCL) aim to maximize agreement between similar elements. Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features. Additionally, we leverage the masked nodes themselves as negative samples, combining MFR's reconstructive power with GCL's discriminative ability to better capture intrinsic graph structures. Empirically, our proposed framework CORE significantly outperforms MFR across node and graph classification tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.

Yet LLMs often exhibit variability when prompts are phrased with minor differences, even when semantically equivalent. Such inconsistency undermines trust, complicates compliance, and disrupts user experience. While personalization is desirable in certain contexts, many enterprise scenarios-such as HR onboarding, customer support, or policy disclosure-require invariant information delivery regardless of phrasing or prior conversational history. Existing approaches, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and temperature tuning, improve factuality or reduce stochasticity but cannot guarantee stability across equivalent prompts. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly optimize for consistency. Unlike prior applications of GRPO, which have been limited to reasoning and code generation, we adapt GRPO to enforce stability of information content across groups of semantically equivalent prompts. We introduce entropy-based helpfulness and stability rewards, treating prompt variants as groups and resetting conversational context to isolate phrasing effects. Experiments on investment and job recommendation tasks show that our GRPO-trained model reduces variability more effectively than fine-tuning or decoding-based baselines. To our knowledge, this is a novel application of GRPO for aligning LLMs toward information consistency, reframing variability not as an acceptable feature of generative diversity but as a correctable flaw in enterprise deployments."}

A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines."}

Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies.

Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data. The developed unsupervised learning framework enables more accurate modeling of complex multiscale neural dynamics by leveraging information in multimodal recordings while incorporating regime switches.

We present an information-theoretic framework measuring a neural representation's effective degrees of freedom. We apply Shannon entropy to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the number of effective features as the minimum neurons needed for interference-free encoding. Equivalently, this measures how many \"virtual neurons\" the network simulates through superposition. When networks encode more effective features than actual neurons, they must accept interference as the price of compression. Our metric strongly correlates with ground truth in toy models, detects minimal superposition in algorithmic tasks, and reveals systematic reduction under dropout. Layer-wise patterns mirror intrinsic dimensionality studies on Pythia-70M. The metric also captures developmental dynamics, detecting sharp feature consolidation during grokking. Surprisingly, adversarial training can increase effective features while improving robustness, contradicting the hypothesis that superposition causes vulnerability. Instead, the effect depends on task complexity and network capacity: simple tasks with ample capacity allow feature expansion (abundance regime), while complex tasks or limited capacity force reduction (scarcity regime). By defining superposition as lossy compression, this work enables principled measurement of how neural networks organize information under computational constraints, connecting superposition to adversarial robustness."}

Why Do Reasoning Models Loop?", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) generate long chains of thought to solve harder problems, but they often loop, repeating the same text at low temperatures or with greedy decoding. We study why this happens and what role temperature plays. With open reasoning models, we find that looping is common at low temperature. Larger models tend to loop less, and distilled students loop significantly even when their teachers rarely do. This points to mismatches between the training distribution and the learned model, which we refer to as errors in learning, as a key cause. To understand how such errors cause loops, we introduce a synthetic graph reasoning task and demonstrate two mechanisms. First, risk aversion caused by hardness of learning: when the correct progress-making action is hard to learn but an easy cyclic action is available, the model puts relatively more probability on the cyclic action and gets stuck. Second, even when there is no hardness, Transformers show an inductive bias toward temporally correlated errors, so the same few actions keep being chosen and loops appear. Higher temperature reduces looping by promoting exploration, but it does not fix the errors in learning, so generations remain much longer than necessary at high temperature; in this sense, temperature is a stopgap rather than a holistic solution. We end with a discussion of training-time interventions aimed at directly reducing errors in learning."}

Despite the global importance of mango (Mangifera indica L.), there is a lack of studies on the robustness of models for the diagnosis of disease in its leaves. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. We conducted a benchmark comparing five architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, Xception, and LCNN (the latter being a lightweight architecture designed specifically for mango leaf diagnosis). The metrics include the F1 score, the corruption error (CE) and the relative mean corruption error (relative mCE). The results show that LCNN outperformed complex models in corruptions that can be present in real-world scenarios such as Defocus Blur, Motion Blur, while also achieving the lowest mCE. Modern architectures (e.g., ResNet-101) exhibited significant performance degradation in corrupted scenarios, despite their high accuracy under ideal conditions. These findings suggest that lightweight and specialized models may be more suitable for real-world applications in edge devices, where robustness and efficiency are critical. The study highlights the need to incorporate robustness assessments in the development of intelligent systems for agriculture, particularly in regions with technological limitations."}

The current state of the scenario is assumed to be known from sensors and the prediction is taking into account various hypotheses about the behavior of traffic participants. This way, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of traffic participants can be modelled in detail. In the first part of this paper a model-based approach is presented to compute Predicted-Occupancy Grids (POG), which are introduced as a grid-based probabilistic representation of the future scenario hypotheses. However, due to the large number of possible trajectories for each traffic participant, the model-based approach comes with a very high computational load. Thus, a machine-learning approach is adopted for the computation of POGs. This work uses a novel grid-based representation of the current state of the traffic scenario and performs the mapping to POGs. This representation consists of augmented cells in an occupancy grid. The adopted machine-learning approach is based on the Random Forest algorithm. Simulations of traffic scenarios are performed to compare the machine-learning with the model-based approach. The results are promising and could enable the real-time computation of POGs for vehicle safety applications.

However, aggressive bitwidth reduction remains challenging due to activation outliers, leading to accuracy degradation. Existing methods, such as outlier-handling and group quantization, achieve high accuracy but incur substantial energy consumption. To address this, we propose SeVeDo, an energy-efficient SVD-based heterogeneous accelerator that structurally separates outlier-sensitive components into a high-precision low-rank path, while the remaining computations are executed in a low-bit residual datapath with group quantization. To further enhance efficiency, Hierarchical Group Quantization (HGQ) combines coarse-grained floating-point scaling with fine-grained shifting, effectively reducing dequantization cost. Also, SVD-guided mixed precision (SVD-MP) statically allocates higher bitwidths to precision-sensitive components identified through low-rank decomposition, thereby minimizing floating-point operation cost. Experimental results show that SeVeDo achieves a peak energy efficiency of 13.8TOPS/W, surpassing conventional designs, with 12.7TOPS/W on ViT-Base and 13.4TOPS/W on Llama2-7B benchmarks."}

However, such models often rely on millions to billions of training sequences and billions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive computational costs and significant barriers to reproducibility and accessibility, particularly for academic labs. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of data pruning for BioFM pretraining and propose a post-hoc influence-guided data pruning framework tailored to biological domains. Our approach introduces a subset-based self-influence formulation that enables efficient estimation of sample importance at low computational cost, and builds upon it two simple yet effective selection strategies, namely Top-k Influence (Top I) and Coverage-Centric Influence (CCI). We empirically validate our method on two representative BioFMs, RNA-FM and ESM-C. For RNA, our framework consistently outperforms random selection baselines under an extreme pruning rate of over 99 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our framework on protein-related tasks using ESM-C. In particular, our coreset even outperforms random subsets that are ten times larger in both RNA and protein settings, revealing substantial redundancy in biological sequence datasets. These findings underscore the potential of influence-guided data pruning to substantially reduce the computational cost of BioFM pretraining, paving the way for more efficient, accessible, and sustainable biological AI research."}

We present a diagnostic study using the Amazon Computers co-purchase data to understand when and why GCNs help. Through systematic experiments with simulated label scarcity, feature ablation, and per-class analysis, we find that GCN performance depends critically on the interaction between graph homophily and feature quality. GCNs provide the largest gains under extreme label scarcity, where they leverage neighborhood structure to compensate for limited supervision. Surprisingly, GCNs can match their original performance even when node features are replaced with random noise, suggesting that structure alone carries sufficient signal on highly homophilous graphs. However, GCNs hurt performance when homophily is low and features are already strong, as noisy neighbors corrupt good predictions. Our quadrant analysis reveals that GCNs help in three of four conditions and only hurt when low homophily meets strong features. These findings offer practical guidance for practitioners deciding whether to adopt graph-based methods."}

This reliance adds engineering complexity and hyperparameter tuning, while also lacking a direct data-driven gradient signal, which might result in sub-optimal compression. In this paper, we introduce CoDeQ, a simple, fully differentiable method for joint pruning--quantization. Our approach builds on a key observation: the dead-zone of a scalar quantizer is equivalent to magnitude pruning, and can be used to induce sparsity directly within the quantization operator. Concretely, we parameterize the dead-zone width and learn it via backpropagation, alongside the quantization parameters. This design provides explicit control of sparsity, regularized by a single global hyperparameter, while decoupling sparsity selection from bit-width selection. The result is a method for Compression with Dead-zone Quantizer (CoDeQ) that supports both fixed-precision and mixed-precision quantization (controlled by an optional second hyperparameter). It simultaneously determines the sparsity pattern and quantization parameters in a single end-to-end optimization. Consequently, CoDeQ does not require any auxiliary procedures, making the method architecture-agnostic and straightforward to implement. On ImageNet with ResNet-18, CoDeQ reduces bit operations to ~5% while maintaining close to full precision accuracy in both fixed and mixed-precision regimes."}

However, MMDI relies on the Helmholtz equation, which assumes wave propagation in a uniform, homogeneous, and infinite medium. Furthermore, the use of the Laplacian operator makes MMDI highly sensitive to noise, which compromises the accuracy and reliability of stiffness estimates. In this study, we propose the Deep-Learning driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in MRE (DIME), aimed at enhancing the robustness of inversion. DIME is trained on the displacement fields-stiffness maps pair generated through Finite Element Modelling (FEM) simulations. To capture local wave behavior and improve robustness to global image variations, DIME is trained on small image patches. We first validated DIME using homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets simulated with FEM, where DIME produced stiffness maps with low inter-pixel variability, accurate boundary delineation, and higher correlation with ground truth (GT) compared to MMDI. Next, DIME was evaluated in a realistic anatomy-informed simulated liver dataset with known GT and compared directly to MMDI. DIME reproduced ground-truth stiffness patterns with high fidelity (r = 0.99, R^2 = 0.98), while MMDI showed greater underestimation. After validating DIME on synthetic data, we tested the model in in vivo liver MRE data from eight healthy and seven fibrotic subjects. DIME preserved physiologically consistent stiffness patterns and closely matched MMDI, which showed directional bias. Overall, DIME showed higher correlation with ground truth and visually similar stiffness patterns, whereas MMDI displayed a larger bias that can potentially be attributed to directional filtering. These preliminary results highlight the feasibility of DIME for clinical applications in MRE."}

However, they perform poorly when applied directly to tabular fraud detection due to the difficulty of reasoning over many features, the extreme class imbalance, and the absence of contextual information. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings.

Existing LLM personalization benchmarks are largely centered on two axes: accurately recalling user information and accurately applying remembered information in downstream tasks. We argue that a third axis, likability, is both subjective and central to user experience, yet under-measured by current benchmarks. To measure likability holistically, we introduce LikeBench, a multi-session, dynamic evaluation framework that measures likability across multiple dimensions by how much an LLM can adapt over time to a user's preferences to provide more likable responses. In LikeBench, the LLMs engage in conversation with a simulated user and learn preferences only from the ongoing dialogue. As the interaction unfolds, models try to adapt to responses, and after each turn, they are evaluated for likability across seven dimensions by the same simulated user. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to decompose likability into multiple diagnostic metrics: emotional adaptation, formality matching, knowledge adaptation, reference understanding, conversation length fit, humor fit, and callback, which makes it easier to pinpoint where a model falls short. To make the simulated user more realistic and discriminative, LikeBench uses fine-grained, psychologically grounded descriptive personas rather than the coarse high/low trait rating based personas used in prior work. Our benchmark shows that strong memory performance does not guarantee high likability: DeepSeek R1, with lower memory accuracy (86%, 17 facts/profile), outperformed Qwen3 by 28% on likability score despite Qwen3's higher memory accuracy (93%, 43 facts/profile). Even SOTA models like GPT-5 adapt well in short exchanges but show only limited robustness in longer, noisier interactions."}

To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro). With only 1K labeled and 3K unlabeled samples, TraPO reaches 42.6% average accuracy, surpassing the best unsupervised method trained on 45K unlabeled samples (38.3%). Notably, when using 4K labeled and 12K unlabeled samples, TraPO even outperforms the fully supervised model trained on the full 45K labeled samples on all benchmarks, while using only 10% of the labeled data.

However, transferring knowledge effectively from one graph to another remains a critical challenge. This highlights the need for algorithms capable of applying information extracted from a source graph to an unlabeled target graph, a task known as unsupervised graph domain adaptation (GDA). One key difficulty in unsupervised GDA is conditional shift, which hinders transferability. In this paper, we show that conditional shift can be observed only if there exists local dependencies among node features. To support this claim, we perform a rigorous analysis and also further provide generalization bounds of GDA when dependent node features are modeled using markov chains. Guided by the theoretical findings, we propose to improve GDA by decorrelating node features, which can be specifically implemented through decorrelated GCN layers and graph transformer layers. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing not only substantial performance enhancements over baseline GDA methods but also clear visualizations of small intra-class distances in the learned representations.

The technique of n-step returns is known to increase the convergence speed of RL algorithms compared to their 1-step returns-based versions. However, SAC is notoriously difficult to combine with n-step returns, since their usual combination introduces bias in off-policy algorithms due to the changes in action distribution. While this problem is solved by importance sampling, a method for estimating expected values of one distribution using samples from another distribution, importance sampling may result in numerical instability. In this work, we combine SAC with n-step returns in a way that overcomes this issue. We present an approach to applying numerically stable importance sampling with simplified hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, we analyze the entropy estimation approach of Soft Actor-Critic in the context of the n-step maximum entropy framework and formulate the $τ$-sampled entropy estimation to reduce the variance of the learning target.

This ensemble-based encoding is independent of chemical detail, compatible with any molecular representation and illustrated here in the homopolymer case using a minimal language model.

We introduce a novel deep learning architecture, WAY, designed to process these reformulated trajectories for long-term destination estimation days to weeks in advance.

The representation layer generates multi-channel vector sequences from kinematic and non-kinematic features. CASP blocks utilize multi-headed channel- and self-attention for aggregation and sequential information delivery.

Experiments on 5-year AIS data demonstrate WAY's superiority over conventional spatial grid-based approaches regardless of trajectory progression. Results further confirm that adopting GD leads to performance gains. Finally, we explore WAY's potential for real-world application through multitask learning for ETA estimation."}

Deep learning enables high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts that can surpass traditional numerical models, while FL allows institutions in different locations to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, addressing efficiency and security concerns. While FL has shown promise across heterogeneous regions, its distributed nature introduces new vulnerabilities. In particular, data poisoning attacks, in which compromised clients inject manipulated training data, can degrade performance or introduce systematic biases. These threats are amplified by spatial dependencies in meteorological data, allowing localized perturbations to influence broader regions through global model aggregation. In this study, we investigate how adversarial clients distort federated surface temperature forecasts trained on the Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis (CERRA) dataset. We simulate geographically distributed clients and evaluate patch-based and global biasing attacks on regional temperature forecasts. Our results show that even a small fraction of poisoned clients can mislead predictions across large, spatially connected areas. A global temperature bias attack from a single compromised client shifts predictions by up to -1.7 K, while coordinated patch attacks more than triple the mean squared error and produce persistent regional anomalies exceeding +3.5 K. Finally, we assess trimmed mean aggregation as a defense mechanism, showing that it successfully defends against global bias attacks (2-13\\% degradation) but fails against patch attacks (281-603\\% amplification), exposing limitations of outlier-based defenses for spatially correlated data."}

Our study focuses on masked feature reconstruction (MFR), a generative technique where a model learns to restore the raw features of masked nodes in a self-supervised manner. We observe that both MFR and graph contrastive learning (GCL) aim to maximize agreement between similar elements. Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features. Additionally, we leverage the masked nodes themselves as negative samples, combining MFR's reconstructive power with GCL's discriminative ability to better capture intrinsic graph structures. Empirically, our proposed framework CORE significantly outperforms MFR across node and graph classification tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results. In particular, CORE surpasses GraphMAE and GraphMAE2 by up to 2.80% and 3.72% on node classification tasks, and by up to 3.82% and 3.76% on graph classification tasks."}

In this work, we consider a label weakening approach to generate robust retrieval models in the presence of label noise. Instead of enforcing a single, potentially erroneous label for each query document pair, we allow for a set of plausible labels derived from both the observed supervision and the model's confidence scores. We perform an extensive evaluation considering two retrieval models, one re-ranking model, considering four diverse ranking datasets. To this end, we also consider a realistic noisy setting by using a semantic-aware noise generation technique to generate different ratios of noise. Our initial results show that label weakening can improve the performance of the retrieval tasks in comparison to 10 different state-of-the-art loss functions."}

The main challenge lies in designing a parameterization that satisfies critical desiderata, including boundary conditions, differentiability, and monotonicity of the SNR. To effectively meet these requirements, we represent scheduler functions as Bézier functions, where control points naturally enforce these properties. This reduces the problem to learning an ordered set of points in the time range, while the interpretation of the points changes from ODE timesteps to Bézier control points.

A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines."}

As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, managing risks arising from insufficient forgetting or utility loss is increasingly crucial. Current MU techniques lack effective mechanisms for evaluating and controlling these risks, hindering the selection of strategies that appropriately balance safety and utility, and raising trust concerns surrounding the \"right to be forgotten.\" To address these issues, we propose FROC, a unified framework with Risk-Optimized Control for machine unlearning in LLMs. FROC is built around a conformal-style risk-control formulation that expresses a user-specified risk budget on unlearning behavior. This probability-based constraint enables FROC to compare MU strategies, identify feasible operating regions, and guide hyperparameter selection according to desired trade-offs between forgetting sufficiency and utility preservation. To operationalize this constraint, FROC introduces a smoothly varying continuous risk model that aggregates forgetting deficiency and utility degradation into a single configuration-level score. Building on conformal risk analysis, FROC computes (1) the Conformal Unlearning Risk (CUR), a data-driven estimated value on the probability that forgotten samples continue to influence model predictions, and (2) risk-controlled configuration sets, which identify unlearning hyperparameters that are valid under the specified risk budget. Experiments across multiple LLM MU methods demonstrate that FROC produces stable, interpretable risk landscapes and reveals consistent relationships between unlearning configurations, semantic shift, and utility impact. FROC reframes MU as a controllable, risk-aware process and offers a practical foundation for managing unlearning behavior in large-scale LLM deployments."}

However, high computational demands, complex incentive mechanisms, and disparities in client-side computing power often lead to long times and higher costs. To address these challenges, many existing methods rely on server-side knowledge distillation that solely removes the updates of the target client, overlooking the privacy embedded in the contributions of other clients, which can lead to privacy leakage. In this work, we introduce DPUL, a novel server-side unlearning method that deeply unlearns all influential weights to prevent privacy pitfalls. Our approach comprises three components: (i) identifying high-weight parameters by filtering client update magnitudes, and rolling them back to ensure deep removal. (ii) leveraging the variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct and eliminate low-weight parameters. (iii) utilizing a projection-based technique to recover the model. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that DPUL surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, providing a 1%-5% improvement in accuracy and up to 12x reduction in time cost."}

We extend the neural network architecture, which can be trained with backpropagation with a softmax function and a cross-entropy loss, or by solving a system of linear equations. A new subgraph-/distance-based membership function for graph regularization is also proposed, along with a new GG recomputation algorithm that is less computationally expensive than the standard approach.

Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.

Finally, both anomalous and normal training data are often scarce, particularly for newly introduced product variations. We investigate on-device continual learning for unsupervised VAD with localization, extending the PatchCore to incorporate online learning for real-world industrial scenarios.

We introduce a new statistical primitive, the reproducibility budget $C_T$, which quantifies a system's finite capacity for statistical reproducibility - the extent to which its sampling process can remain governed by a consistent underlying distribution in the presence of both exogenous change and endogenous feedback. Formally, $C_T$ is defined as the cumulative Fisher-Rao path length of the coupled learner-environment evolution, measuring the total distributional motion accumulated during learning. From this construct we derive a drift-feedback generalization bound of order $O(T^{-1/2} + C_T/T)$, and we prove a matching minimax lower bound showing that this rate is minimax-optimal. Consequently, the results establish a reproducibility speed limit: no algorithm can achieve smaller worst-case generalization error than that imposed by the average Fisher-Rao drift rate $C_T/T$ of the data-generating process.

Unlike synchronous monitoring, this approach does not impose runtime latency, while still attempting to disrupt attacks before irreversible harm occurs. We treat monitor development as an adversarial game between a blue team (who design monitors) and a red team (who create sabotaging agents).

This challenges interpretability, yet we lack principled methods to measure superposition. We present an information-theoretic framework measuring a neural representation's effective degrees of freedom. We apply Shannon entropy to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the number of effective features as the minimum neurons needed for interference-free encoding. Equivalently, this measures how many \"virtual neurons\" the network simulates through superposition. When networks encode more effective features than actual neurons, they must accept interference as the price of compression. Our metric strongly correlates with ground truth in toy models, detects minimal superposition in algorithmic tasks, and reveals systematic reduction under dropout. Layer-wise patterns mirror intrinsic dimensionality studies on Pythia-70M. The metric also captures developmental dynamics, detecting sharp feature consolidation during grokking. Surprisingly, adversarial training can increase effective features while improving robustness, contradicting the hypothesis that superposition causes vulnerability. Instead, the effect depends on task complexity and network capacity: simple tasks with ample capacity allow feature expansion (abundance regime), while complex tasks or limited capacity force reduction (scarcity regime). By defining superposition as lossy compression, this work enables principled measurement of how neural networks organize information under computational constraints, connecting superposition to adversarial robustness."}

In this work, we provide a formal approach to reduce the dimensionality of systems via convex autoencoders and learn the dynamics in the latent space through a kernel-based method. We then construct a finite abstraction from the learned model in the latent space and guarantee that the abstraction contains the true behaviors of the original system. We show that the verification results in the latent space can be mapped back to the original system.

This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. We conducted a benchmark comparing five architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, Xception, and LCNN (the latter being a lightweight architecture designed specifically for mango leaf diagnosis). The metrics include the F1 score, the corruption error (CE) and the relative mean corruption error (relative mCE). The results show that LCNN outperformed complex models in corruptions that can be present in real-world scenarios such as Defocus Blur, Motion Blur, while also achieving the lowest mCE. Modern architectures (e.g., ResNet-101) exhibited significant performance degradation in corrupted scenarios, despite their high accuracy under ideal conditions.

We propose Directional Textual Inversion (DTI), which fixes the embedding magnitude to an in-distribution scale and optimizes only direction on the unit hypersphere via Riemannian SGD. We cast direction learning as MAP with a von Mises-Fisher prior, yielding a constant-direction prior gradient that is simple and efficient to incorporate. Across personalization tasks, DTI improves text fidelity over TI and TI-variants while maintaining subject similarity.

The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents."}

Existing methods often rely on pairwise connections, neglecting high-order dependencies among multiple entities and relations, and they treat structural and semantic signals independently, hindering effective cross-modal integration. To address these challenges, we propose MetaHGNIE, a meta-path induced hypergraph contrastive learning framework for disentangling and aligning structural and semantic information. MetaHGNIE constructs a higher-order knowledge graph via meta-path sequences, where typed hyperedges capture multi-entity relational contexts. Structural dependencies are aggregated with local attention, while semantic representations are encoded through a hypergraph transformer equipped with sparse chunking to reduce redundancy. Finally, a multimodal fusion module integrates structural and semantic embeddings under contrastive learning with auxiliary supervision, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark NIE datasets demonstrate that MetaHGNIE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly modeling higher-order interactions and cross-modal alignment in heterogeneous knowledge graphs.

Ríos", "Nicanor Quijano", "Luis F. Giraldo"], "title": "World Models Unlock Optimal Foraging Strategies in Reinforcement Learning Agents", "comment": "14 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Patch foraging involves the deliberate and planned process of determining the optimal time to depart from a resource-rich region and investigate potentially more beneficial alternatives. The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) is frequently used to characterize this process, offering an optimality model for such foraging behaviors. Although this model has been widely used to make predictions in behavioral ecology, discovering the computational mechanisms that facilitate the emergence of optimal patch-foraging decisions in biological foragers remains under investigation. Here, we show that artificial foragers equipped with learned world models naturally converge to MVT-aligned strategies. Using a model-based reinforcement learning agent that acquires a parsimonious predictive representation of its environment, we demonstrate that anticipatory capabilities, rather than reward maximization alone, drive efficient patch-leaving behavior. Compared with standard model-free RL agents, these model-based agents exhibit decision patterns similar to many of their biological counterparts, suggesting that predictive world models can serve as a foundation for more explainable and biologically grounded decision-making in AI systems. Overall, our findings highlight the value of ecological optimality principles for advancing interpretable and adaptive AI."}

Quantum error mitigation (QEM) offers a promising pathway to enhance computational accuracy on near-term devices, yet existing methods face a difficult trade-off between performance, resource overhead, and theoretical guarantees. In this work, we introduce neighbor-informed learning (NIL), a versatile and scalable QEM framework that unifies and strengthens existing methods such as zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) and probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), while offering improved flexibility, accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.\n  NIL learns to predict the ideal output of a target quantum circuit from the noisy outputs of its structurally related ``neighbor'' circuits. A key innovation is our 2-design training method, which generates training data for our machine learning model. In contrast to conventional learning-based QEM protocols that create training circuits by replacing non-Clifford gates with uniformly random Clifford gates, our approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Furthermore, we prove that the required size of the training set scales only \\emph{logarithmically} with the total number of neighbor circuits, enabling NIL to be applied to problems involving large-scale quantum circuits. Our work establishes a theoretically grounded and practically efficient framework for QEM, paving a viable path toward achieving quantum advantage on noisy hardware."}

Project page: https://kagnlp.github.io/WebOperator/", "summary": "LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution."}

We present Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs) and Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) as hybrid quantum language models, reporting the first empirical demonstration of generative language modeling trained and evaluated end-to-end on real quantum hardware. Our architecture combines hardware-optimized parametric quantum circuits with a lightweight classical projection layer, utilizing a multi-sample SPSA strategy to efficiently train quantum parameters despite hardware noise. To characterize the capabilities of these models, we introduce a synthetic dataset designed to isolate syntactic dependencies in a controlled, low-resource environment. Experiments on IBM Quantum processors reveal the critical trade-offs between circuit depth and trainability, demonstrating that while noise remains a significant factor, observable-based readout enables the successful learning of sequential patterns on NISQ devices. These results establish a rigorous engineering baseline for generative quantum natural language processing, validating the feasibility of training complex sequence models on current quantum hardware."}

Current approaches either maintain unlimited memory stores, leading to computational intractability and privacy concerns, or employ simplistic forgetting mechanisms that compromise agent coherence and functionality. This paper introduces the Memory-Aware Retention Schema (MaRS), a novel framework for human-centered memory management in generative agents, coupled with six theoretically-grounded forgetting policies that balance performance, privacy, and computational efficiency. We present the Forgetful but Faithful Agent (FiFA) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses agent performance across narrative coherence, goal completion, social recall accuracy, privacy preservation, and cost efficiency. Through extensive experimentation involving 300 evaluation runs across multiple memory budgets and agent configurations, we demonstrate that our hybrid forgetting policy achieves superior performance (composite score: 0.911) while maintaining computational tractability and privacy guarantees. Our work establishes new benchmarks for memory-budgeted agent evaluation and provides practical guidelines for deploying generative agents in resource-constrained, privacy-sensitive environments. The theoretical foundations, implementation framework, and empirical results contribute to the emerging field of human-centered AI by addressing fundamental challenges in agent memory management that directly impact user trust, system scalability, and regulatory compliance."}

However, the standard DPO formulation, in which both the chosen and rejected responses are generated by the same policy, suffers from a weak learning signal because the two responses often share similar errors and exhibit small Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This leads to slow and unstable convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO), a new framework that incorporates hint-guided reflection into the DPO paradigm. RPO uses external models to identify hallucination sources and generate concise reflective hints, enabling the construction of on-policy preference pairs with stronger contrastiveness and clearer preference signals. We theoretically show that conditioning on hints increases the expected preference margin through mutual information and improves sample efficiency while remaining within the policy distribution family. Empirically, RPO achieves superior alignment with fewer training samples and iterations, substantially reducing hallucination rates and delivering state-of-the-art performance across multimodal benchmarks."}

However, there is currently a lack of high-quality datasets specifically designed to evaluate the ability of large multi-modal models (LMMs) to discover medical insights. In this paper, we introduce MedInsightBench, the first benchmark that comprises 332 carefully curated medical cases, each annotated with thoughtfully designed insights. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations. Our analysis indicates that existing LMMs exhibit limited performance on MedInsightBench, which is primarily attributed to their challenges in extracting multi-step, deep insights and the absence of medical expertise. Therefore, we propose MedInsightAgent, an automated agent framework for medical data analysis, composed of three modules: Visual Root Finder, Analytical Insight Agent, and Follow-up Question Composer. Experiments on MedInsightBench highlight pervasive challenges and demonstrate that MedInsightAgent can improve the performance of general LMMs in medical data insight discovery."}

Here, we introduce an error-driven optimization framework for arithmetic reasoning that enhances a Code Generation Agent (CGA), specifically applied to on-premises small language models (SLMs). Through a systematic evaluation of a leading SLM (Qwen3 4B), we find that while the base model exhibits fundamental limitations in arithmetic tasks, our proposed error-driven method, which clusters erroneous predictions to refine prompt-rules iteratively, dramatically improves performance, elevating the model's accuracy to 70.8\\%. Our results suggest that developing reliable, interpretable, and industrially deployable AI assistants can be achieved not only through costly fine-tuning but also via systematic, error-driven prompt optimization, enabling small models to surpass larger language models (GPT-3.5 Turbo) in a privacy-compliant manner."}
