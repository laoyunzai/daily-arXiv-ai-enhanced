### [1] [Analytical characterization of self sustained nonlinear oscillators modelling human walking and bouncing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19029)
*Varun Nevash,Prakash Kumar,Chinika Dangi*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: 针对混合范德波尔-瑞利-达芬振荡器模型，提出基于Krylov-Bogolyubov法、改进多尺度法和描述函数法的新分析框架，通过极限环稳定性证明与幅值收敛条件分析，为参数估计提供系统化约束方法

Conclusion: 所提方法突破了传统微扰法的局限性，通过幅值收敛条件建立了参数估计的系统化约束体系，为替代纯优化算法提供了理论依据，增强了模型分析的严谨性与实用性

Abstract: Researchers have developed hybrid Van der Pol Rayleigh Duffing type oscillators to model human induced forces; however, their analytical framework has largely relied on the Lindstedt Poincare perturbation method, energy balance approaches, and harmonic balance techniques. This paper aims to apply new mathematical tools to these existing models and address potential research gaps. An analytical proof for the stability of the limit cycle has been formulated by using the Krylov Bogolyubov perturbation method. The multiple scales method has been modified to highlight an iterative algorithm for determining the order of approximation required to capture nonlinear effects. The describing function method is utilised to formulate an alternate amplitude. Comparisons between first order amplitudes obtained from perturbation analysis and the describing function formulations reveal conditions under which the two approaches converge. These conditions are exploited to formulate additional constraints for the estimation of model parameters, offering a systematic alternative to purely optimisation based approaches.

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: 研究了耦合系统中的"安全超调"现象，将孤立系统的反平方律准则推广到具有时滞耦合和非线性相互作用的单向耦合慢-快系统，并用AMOC与亚马逊雨林/格陵兰冰盖的相互作用模型进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明有限时间超调在孤立系统中可以是安全的（遵循反平方律），但现实中的气候和生态系统往往是相互作用的。需要理解子系统间的耦合如何影响安全超调行为，这对于准确预测和应对气候临界点至关重要。

Method: 针对具有非线性相互作用和时滞耦合的单向耦合慢-快系统，推导了安全超调发生的数学准则。该准则将孤立系统的反平方律推广到交互场景，并用子系统间的时标分离和耦合强度明确表达。

Result: 得到了一个适用于耦合系统的安全超调判定准则，其形式类似于孤立系统的反平方律，但包含了耦合强度和时标分离等交互参数。该准则能够明确预测在什么条件下超调是安全的。

Conclusion: 成功将安全超调理论从孤立系统扩展到耦合系统，为研究真实世界中相互作用的气候临界点提供了新的理论工具。通过AMOC与亚马逊雨林或格陵兰冰盖的耦合模型验证了该准则的适用性，有助于更好地理解气候系统的突变风险。

Abstract: Abrupt transitions are a central concern in climate and ecological research, and may arise when critical thresholds known as tipping points are crossed. However, previous work has shown that finite-time overshoots of tipping points can be safe, and that such behavior is captured by an inverse-square-law criterion when overshoots are sufficiently small and slow. So far studied in isolated systems with external drivers, (un)safe overshoots may also emerge from interactions between subsystems. Here, we investigate safe-overshoot phenomena in unidirectionally coupled slow-fast systems featuring both nonlinear interactions and coupling through time-derivatives. Specifically, we derive a criterion for the occurrence of safe overshoots analogous to the inverse-square law for isolated systems, but adapted to interactive settings, and expressed explicitly in terms of the timescale separation and coupling strength between subsystems. We illustrate these results using two conceptual models in which the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation interacts with either the Amazon rainforest or the Greenland Ice Sheet.

### [3] [Boltzmann Generators for Condensed Matter via Riemannian Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18482)
*Emil Hoffmann,Maximilian Schebek,Leon Klein,Frank Noé,Jutta Rogal*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: This paper applies Riemannian flow matching to equilibrium sampling in periodic condensed-phase systems, using Hutchinson's trace estimator with cumulant expansion bias correction to enable accurate free energy estimation on large systems like monatomic ice without traditional multistage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching shows promise for scalable generative modeling but remains underexplored for equilibrium sampling in periodic condensed-phase systems (e.g., crystalline materials), where inherent periodicity and high computational costs of density estimation pose significant challenges.

Method: Incorporates system periodicity via Riemannian flow matching for continuous normalizing flows. Mitigates density estimation costs using Hutchinson's trace estimator enhanced with cumulant expansion-based bias correction to ensure thermodynamic reweighting accuracy.

Result: Successfully validates on monatomic ice: trains on unprecedentedly large systems and achieves highly accurate free energy estimates, eliminating the need for computationally expensive traditional multistage estimators.

Conclusion: Riemannian flow matching with stochastic bias-corrected density estimation provides a scalable, accurate framework for equilibrium sampling in periodic systems, advancing free energy calculation efficiency in statistical mechanics.

Abstract: Sampling equilibrium distributions is fundamental to statistical mechanics. While flow matching has emerged as scalable state-of-the-art paradigm for generative modeling, its potential for equilibrium sampling in condensed-phase systems remains largely unexplored. We address this by incorporating the periodicity inherent to these systems into continuous normalizing flows using Riemannian flow matching. The high computational cost of exact density estimation intrinsic to continuous normalizing flows is mitigated by using Hutchinson's trace estimator, utilizing a crucial bias-correction step based on cumulant expansion to render the stochastic estimates suitable for rigorous thermodynamic reweighting. Our approach is validated on monatomic ice, demonstrating the ability to train on systems of unprecedented size and obtain highly accurate free energy estimates without the need for traditional multistage estimators.

### [4] [Multiphysics Modelling of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor using NekRS and the Fission Matrix Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18626)
*Maximiliano Dalinger,Elia Merzari,Saya Lee*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper develops a fast, coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics model for the Molten Salt Fast Reactor using the Fission Matrix method within the Cardinal code to address tight coupling caused by circulating fuel coolant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The MSFR's unique design where fuel circulates as coolant creates strong neutronics-thermal hydraulics coupling, requiring multiphysics computational models for accurate simulation.

Method: Develops a reduced-order neutronics model using the Fission Matrix method within Cardinal (MOOSE framework), integrating NekRS for CFD instead of direct OpenMC Monte Carlo simulation.

Result: The FM method enables fast, accurate neutronics simulations using precalculated Monte Carlo databases, providing efficient multiphysics capability for MSFR analysis.

Conclusion: A computationally efficient multiphysics model has been developed by integrating the Fission Matrix method with high-fidelity thermal-hydraulics, offering a practical tool for MSFR design and safety analysis.

Abstract: The Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) has the particularity that the coolant is also the fuel, which tightens the coupling between neutronics and thermal hydraulics as the fuel circulates through the primary system. Therefore, developing computational models to analyze the MSFR requires a multiphysics approach. In this paper, we propose developing a neutronic thermal-hydraulic computational model of the MSFR that uses a reduced-order model to solve the neutronics equations. The principal computational tool chosen for this purpose is the high-fidelity code Cardinal, a wrapping within the MOOSE framework that integrates the Computational Fluid Dynamics code NekRS and the Monte Carlo particle transport code OpenMC. However, we use the Fission Matrix (FM) Method to solve the neutronics equations instead of OpenMC. The FM method can perform fast and still accurate neutronics simulations. It relies on precalculated databases obtained through a Monte Carlo simulation.

### [5] [Revisiting the Seasonal Trend Decomposition for Enhanced Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18465)
*Sanjeev Panta,Xu Yuan,Li Chen,Nian-Feng Tzeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种基于时间序列分解的改进方法，通过分别处理趋势和季节性成分来提升多元时间序列预测性能，在多个基准数据集上实现约10%的MSE降低，并提出了计算效率更高的dual-MLP模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界应用中时间序列预测面临重大挑战，需要在分解时间序列的基础上改进机器学习模型架构，以更准确地预测多元时间序列。

Method: 将时间序列分解为趋势和季节性成分：趋势成分使用可逆实例归一化处理，季节性成分则直接应用骨干模型而不进行归一化或缩放；最终提出dual-MLP模型作为计算效率更高的解决方案。

Result: 在基准数据集上使四种先进基线模型的MSE平均降低约10%；在美国地质调查局(USGS)水文数据集上同样取得显著改进，同时保持线性时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法在各种数据集上均能稳定提升预测性能，证明了其在真实世界应用中的有效性，且计算效率较高。

Abstract: Time series forecasting presents significant challenges in real-world applications across various domains. Building upon the decomposition of the time series, we enhance the architecture of machine learning models for better multivariate time series forecasting. To achieve this, we focus on the trend and seasonal components individually and investigate solutions to predict them with less errors. Recognizing that reversible instance normalization is effective only for the trend component, we take a different approach with the seasonal component by directly applying backbone models without any normalization or scaling procedures. Through these strategies, we successfully reduce error values of the existing state-of-the-art models and finally introduce dual-MLP models as more computationally efficient solutions. Furthermore, our approach consistently yields positive results with around 10% MSE average reduction across four state-of-the-art baselines on the benchmark datasets. We also evaluate our approach on a hydrological dataset extracted from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) river stations, where our models achieve significant improvements while maintaining linear time complexity, demonstrating real-world effectiveness.

### [6] [Transformers for dynamical systems learn transfer operators in-context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18679)
*Anthony Bao,Jeffrey Lai,William Gilpin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究小型Transformer在动力系统预测中的上下文学习能力，发现其无需重训练即可预测未见系统，通过延迟嵌入和转移算子策略实现，并观察到双重下降现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模科学基础模型展现出"上下文学习"现象，能够适应训练时未见过的物理环境，这挑战了传统学习理论。为理解这一机制，需在极简环境中研究动力系统预测能力。

Method: 训练一个两层单头Transformer来预测一个动力系统，随后在不重新训练的情况下评估其预测另一个不同系统的能力。

Result: 发现训练早期存在分布内与分布外性能的权衡，表现为二次双重下降现象；注意力模型采用转移算子策略：通过延迟嵌入提升时间序列维度以识别系统流形，并预测该流形上长期不变集以刻画全局流动。

Conclusion: 阐明了大型预训练模型无需重训练即可预测未见物理系统的机制，揭示了注意力模型利用全局吸引子信息进行短期预测的独特能力。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for scientific machine learning adapt to physical settings unseen during training, such as zero-shot transfer between turbulent scales. This phenomenon, in-context learning, challenges conventional understanding of learning and adaptation in physical systems. Here, we study in-context learning of dynamical systems in a minimal setting: we train a small two-layer, single-head transformer to forecast one dynamical system, and then evaluate its ability to forecast a different dynamical system without retraining. We discover an early tradeoff in training between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, which manifests as a secondary double descent phenomenon. We discover that attention-based models apply a transfer-operator forecasting strategy in-context. They (1) lift low-dimensional time series using delay embedding, to detect the system's higher-dimensional dynamical manifold, and (2) identify and forecast long-lived invariant sets that characterize the global flow on this manifold. Our results clarify the mechanism enabling large pretrained models to forecast unseen physical systems at test without retraining, and they illustrate the unique ability of attention-based models to leverage global attractor information in service of short-term forecasts.

### [7] [The Sample Complexity of Replicable Realizable PAC Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19552)
*Kasper Green Larsen,Markus Engelund Mathiasen,Chirag Pabbaraju,Clement Svendsen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对可复现的可实现PAC学习问题，建立了样本复杂度的下界，其大小接近$(\log|H|)^{3/2}$，并使用图论方法（Cayley图和谱分析）给出了几乎匹配的上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解可复现的可实现PAC学习的根本样本复杂度，这对于确保机器学习算法的可复现性至关重要。

Method: 构造一个特别困难的学习问题实例，定义与假设类H相关的Cayley图，并通过分析该图邻接矩阵的谱性质来研究相应的随机游走。

Result: 证明了样本复杂度下界对假设类大小的依赖关系接近$(\log|H|)^{3/2}$，并针对该下界实例给出了几乎匹配的上界。

Conclusion: 为可复现的可实现PAC学习提供了接近紧的样本复杂度界限，表明要建立更强的下界需要考虑不同的问题实例。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of replicable realizable PAC learning. We construct a particularly hard learning problem and show a sample complexity lower bound with a close to $(\log|H|)^{3/2}$ dependence on the size of the hypothesis class $H$. Our proof uses several novel techniques and works by defining a particular Cayley graph associated with $H$ and analyzing a suitable random walk on this graph by examining the spectral properties of its adjacency matrix.
  Furthermore, we show an almost matching upper bound for the lower bound instance, meaning if a stronger lower bound exists, one would have to consider a different instance of the problem.

### [8] [Support Vector Data Description for Radar Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18486)
*Jean Pinsolle,Yadang Alexis Rouzoumka,Chengfang Ren,Chistèle Morisseau,Jean-Philippe Ovarlez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 针对重尾杂波环境下经典雷达检测方法的性能退化问题，本文提出基于SVDD和Deep SVDD的一类学习检测框架，设计两种CFAR检测算法，模拟数据实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典雷达自适应检测方法通过估计噪声协方差矩阵实现目标检测，在高斯环境中表现良好，但面对重尾分布杂波（如CES和CGD）时性能显著下降。即使采用M-估计等鲁棒协方差估计器，在热噪声与杂波共存场景下仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出采用支持向量数据描述（SVDD）及其深度扩展Deep SVDD一类学习方法，避免直接估计噪声协方差，将其改造为CFAR检测器，并设计两种新颖的SVDD基检测算法。

Result: 通过模拟雷达数据验证了所提算法的有效性。

Conclusion: SVDD基检测方法通过规避协方差估计，为重尾杂波环境下的雷达目标检测提供了鲁棒且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Classical radar detection techniques rely on adaptive detectors that estimate the noise covariance matrix from target-free secondary data. While effective in Gaussian environments, these methods degrade in the presence of clutter, which is better modeled by heavy-tailed distributions such as the Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) and Compound-Gaussian (CGD) families. Robust covariance estimators like M-estimators or Tyler's estimator address this issue, but still struggle when thermal noise combines with clutter. To overcome these challenges, we investigate the use of Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and its deep extension, Deep SVDD, for target detection. These one-class learning methods avoid direct noise covariance estimation and are adapted here as CFAR detectors. We propose two novel SVDD-based detection algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on simulated radar data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统一记忆智能体(UMA)，通过端到端强化学习统一记忆操作与问答，采用双记忆结构(核心摘要+结构化记忆库)支持主动CRUD操作，解决超长流式信息处理的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文大语言模型和RAG系统被动处理信息，将状态追踪、矛盾解决和证据汇总推迟到查询时，在频繁更新的超长数据流下表现脆弱。

Method: 提出UMA框架：1)端到端强化学习统一记忆操作与问答；2)双记忆表示(紧凑核心摘要+结构化记忆库)；3)支持键值对的显式CRUD操作；4)流式处理中的主动整合机制。

Result: 在13个数据集(Ledger-QA、测试时学习、精确检索)上，UMA在动态推理和学习任务上显著优于长上下文和RAG基线，在标准检索基准上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 端到端学习记忆管理对处理动态长序列至关重要，主动记忆操作比被动处理更有效。

Abstract: Long-context LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems process information passively, deferring state tracking, contradiction resolution, and evidence aggregation to query time, which becomes brittle under ultra long streams with frequent updates. We propose the Unified Memory Agent (UMA), an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that unifies memory operations and question answering within a single policy. UMA maintains a dual memory representation: a compact core summary for global context and a structured Memory Bank that supports explicit CRUD (create, update, delete, reorganize) over key value entries, enabling proactive consolidation during streaming. To evaluate long-horizon memory behavior, we introduce Ledger-QA, a diagnostic benchmark for continuous state tracking where answers are latent values derived from accumulated updates rather than lo cal span retrieval. Across 13 datasets spanning Ledger-QA, Test-Time Learning, and Accurate Retrieval, UMA substantially outperforms long-context and RAG baselines on dynamic reasoning and learning tasks while remaining competitive on standard retrieval benchmarks, underscoring the importance of learned, end-to-end memory management.

*Attila Dobi,Aravindh Manickavasagam,Benjamin Thompson,Xiaohan Yang,Faisal Farooq*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 针对内容安全度量需求，本文设计了一套测量系统，通过机器学习加权抽样和大语言模型标注，实现对用户浏览违规内容比例（prevalence）的准确、多维度评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内容安全团队需要真实反映用户体验的指标，而非仅依赖举报数据。然而违规内容稀少且人工标注成本高昂，导致频繁、平台代表性的研究难以开展。

Method: 提出基于设计的测量系统，包含：(1) 从浏览流中抽取每日概率样本，使用机器学习辅助权重将标注预算集中于高曝光和高风险内容，同时保持无偏性；(2) 通过政策提示和金标准验证的多模态大语言模型进行标注；(3) 生成设计一致性的prevalence估计值、置信区间和仪表板下钻分析。采用单一全局样本支持多维度事后分层估计。

Conclusion: 该系统通过机器学习辅助抽样和LLM标注有效解决了罕见事件测量成本和效率问题，为内容安全提供了真实反映用户体验的prevalence指标，并支持灵活的细分分析。

Abstract: Content safety teams need metrics that reflect what users actually experience, not only what is reported. We study prevalence: the fraction of user views (impressions) that went to content violating a given policy on a given day. Accurate prevalence measurement is challenging because violations are often rare and human labeling is costly, making frequent, platform-representative studies slow. We present a design-based measurement system that (i) draws daily probability samples from the impression stream using ML-assisted weights to concentrate label budget on high-exposure and high-risk content while preserving unbiasedness, (ii) labels sampled items with a multimodal LLM governed by policy prompts and gold-set validation, and (iii) produces design-consistent prevalence estimates with confidence intervals and dashboard drilldowns. A key design goal is one global sample with many pivots: the same daily sample supports prevalence by surface, viewer geography, content age, and other segments through post-stratified estimation. We describe the statistical estimators, variance and confidence interval construction, label-quality monitoring, and an engineering workflow that makes the system configurable across policies.

### [11] [Wide Open Gazes: Quantifying Visual Exploratory Behavior in Soccer with Pose Enhanced Positional Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18519)

Conclusion: 该研究为足球视觉感知分析建立新方法论，开源工具将促进其在足球分析领域的集成应用与标准化发展。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to measuring visual exploratory behavior in soccer rely on counting visual exploratory actions (VEAs) based on rapid head movements exceeding 125°/s, but this method suffer from player position bias (i.e., a focus on central midfielders), annotation challenges, binary measurement constraints (i.e., a player is scanning, or not), lack the power to predict relevant short-term in-game future success, and are incompatible with fundamental soccer analytics models such as pitch control. This research introduces a novel formulaic continuous stochastic vision layer to quantify players' visual perception from pose-enhanced spatiotemporal tracking. Our probabilistic field-of-view and occlusion models incorporate head and shoulder rotation angles to create speed-dependent vision maps for individual players in a two-dimensional top-down plane. We combine these vision maps with pitch control and pitch value surfaces to analyze the awaiting phase (when a player is awaiting the ball to arrive after a pass for a teammate) and their subsequent on-ball phase. We demonstrate that aggregated visual metrics - such as the percentage of defended area observed while awaiting a pass - are predictive of controlled pitch value gained at the end of dribbling actions using 32 games of synchronized pose-enhanced tracking data and on-ball event data from the 2024 Copa America. This methodology works regardless of player position, eliminates manual annotation requirements, and provides continuous measurements that seamlessly integrate into existing soccer analytics frameworks. To further support the integration with existing soccer analytics frameworks we open-source the tools required to make these calculations.

Motivation: 现代机器学习依赖显式目标函数优化，但真正自主系统需在长期演化且目标不明确的环境中运行，亟需无需外部监督的自主评估与结构调节机制。

Method: 构建双时间尺度架构：快尺度状态演化与慢尺度结构适应通过内部压力变量耦合，压力累积作为动力学功能障碍证据，以状态依赖的事件触发方式驱动分段式结构重组，并通过最小玩具模型验证。

Result: 压力调节机制成功产生了时间上分段、自组织的学习过程，无需依赖外部定义的目标函数。

Conclusion: 为开发具备自我评估和内部调节能力的真正自主系统提供了可能的实现路径。

Abstract: Despite their apparent diversity, modern machine learning methods can be reduced to a remarkably simple core principle: learning is achieved by continuously optimizing parameters to minimize or maximize a scalar objective function. This paradigm has been extraordinarily successful for well-defined tasks where goals are fixed and evaluation criteria are explicit. However, if artificial systems are to move toward true autonomy-operating over long horizons and across evolving contexts-objectives may become ill-defined, shifting, or entirely absent. In such settings, a fundamental question emerges: in the absence of an explicit objective function, how can a system determine whether its ongoing internal dynamics are productive or pathological? And how should it regulate structural change without external supervision? In this work, we propose a dynamical framework for learning without an explicit objective. Instead of minimizing external error signals, the system evaluates the intrinsic health of its own internal dynamics and regulates structural plasticity accordingly. We introduce a two-timescale architecture that separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, coupled through an internally generated stress variable that accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction. Structural modification is then triggered not continuously, but as a state-dependent event. Through a minimal toy model, we demonstrate that this stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without reliance on externally defined goals. Our results suggest a possible route toward autonomous learning systems capable of self-assessment and internally regulated structural reorganization.

Conclusion: 消费级可穿戴设备结合自适应可解释深度学习可实现个性化压力评估，为真实场景中可扩展、连续、可解释的心理健康监测奠定基础。

Abstract: Continuous stress forecasting could potentially contribute to lifestyle interventions. This paper presents a novel, explainable, and individualized approach for stress prediction using physiological data from consumer-grade smartwatches. We develop a time series forecasting model that leverages multivariate features, including heart rate variability, activity patterns, and sleep metrics, to predict stress levels across 16 temporal horizons (History window: 3, 5, 7, 9 days; forecasting window: 1, 3, 5, 7 days). Our evaluation involves 16 participants monitored for 10-15 weeks. We evaluate our approach across 16 participants, comparing against state-of-the-art time series models (Informer, TimesNet, PatchTST) and traditional baselines (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) across multiple temporal horizons. Our model achieved performance with an MSE of 0.053, MAE of 0.190, and RMSE of 0.226 in optimal settings (5-day input, 1-day prediction). A comparison with the baseline models shows that our model outperforms TimesNet, PatchTST, CNN-LSTM, LSTM, and CNN under all conditions, representing improvements of 36.9%, 25.5%, and 21.5% over the best baseline. According to the explanability analysis, sleep metrics are the most dominant and consistent stress predictors (importance: 1.1, consistency: 0.9-1.0), while activity features exhibit high inter-participant variability (0.1-0.2). Most notably, the model captures individual-specific patterns where identical features can have opposing effects across users, validating its personalization capabilities. These findings establish that consumer wearables, combined with adaptive and interpretable deep learning, can deliver relevant stress assessment adapted to individual physiological responses, providing a foundation for scalable, continuous, explainable mental health monitoring in real-world settings.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization long after near-zero training loss -- has been studied mainly in single-task settings. We extend geometric analysis to multi-task modular arithmetic, training shared-trunk Transformers on dual-task (mod-add + mod-mul) and tri-task (mod-add + mod-mul + mod-sq) objectives across a systematic weight decay sweep. Five consistent phenomena emerge. (1) Staggered grokking order: multiplication generalizes first, followed by squaring, then addition, with consistent delays across seeds. (2) Universal integrability: optimization trajectories remain confined to an empirically invariant low-dimensional execution manifold; commutator defects orthogonal to this manifold reliably precede generalization. (3) Weight decay phase structure: grokking timescale, curvature depth, reconstruction threshold, and defect lead covary systematically with weight decay, revealing distinct dynamical regimes and a sharp no-decay failure mode. (4) Holographic incompressibility: final solutions occupy only 4--8 principal trajectory directions yet are distributed across full-rank weights and destroyed by minimal perturbations; SVD truncation, magnitude pruning, and uniform scaling all fail to preserve performance. (5) Transverse fragility and redundancy: removing less than 10% of orthogonal gradient components eliminates grokking, yet dual-task models exhibit partial recovery under extreme deletion, suggesting redundant center manifolds enabled by overparameterization. Together, these results support a dynamical picture in which multi-task grokking constructs a compact superposition subspace in parameter space, with weight decay acting as compression pressure and excess parameters supplying geometric redundancy in optimization pathways.

TL;DR: 针对音视频持续测试时适应中的灾难性遗忘问题，提出AV-CTTA方法，通过选择性检索融合层参数实现跨域知识重用，显著提升性能且无需源数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音视频持续测试时适应需要在无标签非平稳域上动态适应模型，但现有SOTA方法因持续参数更新导致灾难性遗忘，性能降至源模型以下

Method: 基于融合层参数的强跨任务迁移性，提出AV-CTTA：仅适应模态融合层，采用选择性参数检索机制，利用小批量测试数据从缓冲区动态检索最佳参数，集成后适应当前分布并保存供未来使用

Result: 在含单模态和双模态损坏的基准数据集上，AV-CTTA显著优于现有方法，同时有效最小化灾难性遗忘

Conclusion: 通过聚焦融合层适应和动态参数重用，AV-CTTA解决了测试时适应中的遗忘问题，实现了更好的跨域泛化能力

Abstract: Audio-visual continual test-time adaptation involves continually adapting a source audio-visual model at test-time, to unlabeled non-stationary domains, where either or both modalities can be distributionally shifted, which hampers online cross-modal learning and eventually leads to poor accuracy. While previous works have tackled this problem, we find that SOTA methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the model's performance drops well below the source model due to continual parameter updates at test-time. In this work, we first show that adapting only the modality fusion layer to a target domain not only improves performance on that domain but can also enhance performance on subsequent domains. Based on this strong cross-task transferability of the fusion layer's parameters, we propose a method, $\texttt{AV-CTTA}$, that improves test-time performance of the models without access to any source data. Our approach works by using a selective parameter retrieval mechanism that dynamically retrieves the best fusion layer parameters from a buffer using only a small batch of test data. These parameters are then integrated into the model, adapted to the current test distribution, and saved back for future use. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets involving unimodal and bimodal corruptions show our proposed $\texttt{AV-CTTA}$ significantly outperforms existing methods while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.

*Abeer Alsheikhi,Amirfarhad Farhadi,Azadeh Zamanifar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as surrogates for expensive smart grid simulators in Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Power Flow problems, achieving 50% faster training and strong policies without needing real simulator samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The energy management in smart grids is complex due to component interdependencies. While RL can solve OPF problems, it suffers from high computational costs and sample inefficiency due to the need for iterative interactions with expensive simulators.

Method: The study uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to replace conventional smart grid simulators. PINNs incorporate physical laws into neural networks, serving as a surrogate model to accelerate RL policy learning.

Result: The PINN surrogate is the only data-driven surrogate model tested that can obtain a strong RL policy without access to true simulator samples. It accelerates training by 50% compared to RL without a surrogate and generates performance scores similar to the original simulator.

Conclusion: Using PINN surrogates effectively addresses computational inefficiency in RL-based smart grid energy management, enabling rapid policy training while maintaining performance comparable to original simulators.

Abstract: The energy management problem in the context of smart grids is inherently complex due to the interdependencies among diverse system components. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proposed for solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, the requirement for iterative interaction with an environment often necessitates computationally expensive simulators, leading to significant sample inefficiency. In this study, these challenges are addressed through the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which can replace conventional and costly smart grid simulators. The RL policy learning process is enhanced so that convergence can be achieved in a fraction of the time required by the original environment. The PINN-based surrogate is compared with other benchmark data-driven surrogate models. By incorporating knowledge of the underlying physical laws, the results show that the PINN surrogate is the only approach considered in this context that can obtain a strong RL policy even without access to samples from the true simulator. The results demonstrate that using PINN surrogates can accelerate training by 50% compared to RL training without a surrogate. This approach enables the rapid generation of performance scores similar to those produced by the original simulator.

TL;DR: 该研究利用卫星雷达数据与新闻文本情感分析，结合交易历史，构建高频次（周度）次城市级别房地产价格指数预测模型，在长期预测（26-34周）中显著降低误差35%，揭示了多模态数据在长时预测中的关键价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统房地产价格指数发布频率低（通常为月度/季度）且仅覆盖城市层面，无法满足社区尺度实时监测和长期规划需求，亟需开发高频次、细粒度的价格预测方法。

Method: 融合区域交易历史、Sentinel-1 SAR卫星雷达后向散射信号、结合词汇情感与语义嵌入的新闻情绪指标及宏观经济变量，利用迪拜35万笔交易数据（2015-2025）构建19个次城市区域的周度价格指数，测试2-34周预测跨度。

Result: 预测效果高度依赖时间跨度：10周内仅用价格历史即可媲美多模态模型；14周后新闻情绪与卫星数据作用显著；长期预测（26-34周）中，全模态模型将平均绝对误差从4.48降至2.93（降低35%），且非参数模型表现优于深度学习架构。

Conclusion: 研究确立了周度次城市指数预测基准，证实遥感数据与新闻情绪在战略相关长时预测中能实质性提升预测精度，为高频房地产市场监测提供了可行框架。

Abstract: Reliable real estate price indicators are typically published at city level and low frequency, limiting their use for neighborhood-scale monitoring and long-horizon planning. We study whether sub-city price indices can be forecasted at weekly frequency by combining physical development signals from satellite radar with market narratives from news text. Using over 350,000 transactions from Dubai Land Department (2015-2025), we construct weekly price indices for 19 sub-city regions and evaluate forecasts from 2 to 34 weeks ahead. Our framework fuses regional transaction history with Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter, news sentiment combining lexical tone and semantic embeddings, and macroeconomic context. Results are strongly horizon dependent: at horizons up to 10 weeks, price history alone matches multimodal configurations, but beyond 14 weeks sentiment and SAR become critical. At long horizons (26-34 weeks), the full multimodal model reduces mean absolute error from 4.48 to 2.93 (35% reduction), with gains statistically significant across regions. Nonparametric learners consistently outperform deep architectures in this data regime. These findings establish benchmarks for weekly sub-city index forecasting and demonstrate that remote sensing and news sentiment materially improve predictability at strategically relevant horizons.

TL;DR: 该论文发现现有指令调优数据选择方法因假设参数独立性而在LoRA等PEFT方法中失效。提出GIST方法，通过SVD从验证梯度中恢复任务特定子空间并投影训练梯度，以更低的存储（0.29%）和计算成本（25%）匹配或超越最优基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标数据选择方法依赖优化器统计量，隐含假设参数坐标独立性，这在LoRA等参数高效微调方法中失效，因其优化几何存在强跨参数耦合，且任务相关更新方向局限于低维子空间。

Method: GIST（梯度等距子空间变换）用子空间对齐替代轴对齐缩放。具体通过谱过滤（SVD）从验证梯度恢复任务特定子空间，将训练梯度投影到此耦合子空间，并根据与目标方向的对齐程度对样本评分。

Result: 大量实验表明，在相同选择预算下，GIST仅需0.29%存储和25%计算时间，性能达到或超过最先进基线。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，在PEFT中通过子空间对齐显式建模耦合优化几何对有效数据选择至关重要，GIST提供了一种简单且原则性的解决方案，实现了卓越的效率和性能。

Abstract: Targeted data selection has emerged as a crucial paradigm for efficient instruction tuning, aiming to identify a small yet influential subset of training examples for a specific target task. In practice, influence is often measured through the effect of an example on parameter updates. To make selection scalable, many approaches leverage optimizer statistics (e.g., Adam states) as an axis-aligned surrogate for update geometry (i.e., diagonal precondition), implicitly treating parameters as coordinate-wise independent. We show that this assumption breaks down in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA. In this setting, the induced optimization geometry exhibits strong cross-parameter coupling with non-trivial off-diagonal interactions, while the task-relevant update directions are confined to a low-dimensional subspace. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose GIST (Gradient Isometric Subspace Transformation), a simple yet principled alternative that replaces axis-aligned scaling with robust subspace alignment. GIST recovers a task-specific subspace from validation gradients via spectral filtering (SVD), projects training gradients into this coupled subspace, and scores examples by their alignment with target directions.Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GIST matches or outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline with only 0.29% of the storage and 25% of the computational time under the same selection budget.

Conclusion: ETAP框架通过结合原则性与数据驱动方法，高效支持可扩展的任务分组，为多任务学习提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: A fundamental problem in multi-task learning (MTL) is identifying groups of tasks that should be learned together. Since training MTL models for all possible combinations of tasks is prohibitively expensive for large task sets, a crucial component of efficient and effective task grouping is predicting whether a group of tasks would benefit from learning together, measured as per-task performance gain over single-task learning. In this paper, we propose ETAP (Ensemble Task Affinity Predictor), a scalable framework that integrates principled and data-driven estimators to predict MTL performance gains. First, we consider the gradient-based updates of shared parameters in an MTL model to measure the affinity between a pair of tasks as the similarity between the parameter updates based on these tasks. This linear estimator, which we call affinity score, naturally extends to estimating affinity within a group of tasks. Second, to refine these estimates, we train predictors that apply non-linear transformations and correct residual errors, capturing complex and non-linear task relationships. We train these predictors on a limited number of task groups for which we obtain ground-truth gain values via multi-task learning for each group. We demonstrate on benchmark datasets that ETAP improves MTL gain prediction and enables more effective task grouping, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across diverse application domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准重排序评估受上游检索质量干扰，无法归因排序行为差异，需隔离变量以精准诊断排序策略本身

Method: 采用Multi-News聚类构建固定8文档证据池，统一输入所有排序器，以BM25和MMR作为可解释的词汇匹配与多样性基准

Result: 345组实验显示：不同LLM在扩展选择量时呈现隐式多样化或冗余增加，且在少量选择时词汇覆盖均弱于基线，排序行为显著偏离而非近似任一基准

Conclusion: 该诊断方法消除检索方差，实现排序策略直接归因，且模型无关，适用于开源及闭源排序系统评估

Abstract: Standard reranking evaluations study how a reranker orders candidates returned by an upstream retriever. This setup couples ranking behavior with retrieval quality, so differences in output cannot be attributed to the ranking policy alone. We introduce a controlled diagnostic that isolates reranking by using Multi-News clusters as fixed evidence pools. We limit each pool to exactly eight documents and pass identical inputs to all rankers. Within this setup, BM25 and MMR serve as interpretable reference points for lexical matching and diversity optimization. Across 345 clusters, we find that redundancy patterns vary by model: one LLM implicitly diversifies at larger selection budgets, while another increases redundancy. In contrast, LLMs underperform on lexical coverage at small selection budgets. As a result, LLM rankings diverge substantially from both baselines rather than consistently approximating either strategy. By eliminating retrieval variance, we can attribute these differences directly to the ranking policy. This diagnostic is model-agnostic and applicable to any ranker, including open source systems and proprietary APIs.

### [21] [Online decoding of rat self-paced locomotion speed from EEG using recurrent neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18637)
*Alejandro de Miguel,Nelson Totah,Uri Maoz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study demonstrates that self-paced locomotion speed can be accurately decoded from non-invasive cortex-wide EEG in rats using recurrent neural networks, achieving R²=0.78, with generalization across sessions but not across animals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate neural decoding of locomotion is crucial for rehabilitation and prosthetic control, but current methods require invasive implants and struggle with self-paced (natural) locomotion, as most studies use externally-imposed speeds on motorized treadmills.

Method: Developed an asynchronous brain-computer interface using 32-electrode skull-surface EEG (0.01-45 Hz) in head-fixed rats on a non-motorized treadmill. Trained recurrent neural networks on over 133 hours of recordings to map ongoing EEG activity to instantaneous treadmill speed.

Result: Achieved high decoding correlation of 0.88 (R²=0.78), primarily driven by visual cortex electrodes and low-frequency (<8 Hz) oscillations. Pre-training on a single session generalized to other sessions within the same rat but not across animals. Cortical states encoded information about past and future speed dynamics extending up to 1000ms.

Conclusion: Non-invasive, cortex-wide EEG can decode self-paced locomotion speed accurately and continuously, providing a practical framework for developing high-performance non-invasive BCI systems while advancing understanding of distributed neural representations of action dynamics.

Abstract: $\textit{Objective.}$ Accurate neural decoding of locomotion holds promise for advancing rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and understanding neural correlates of action. Recent studies have demonstrated decoding of locomotion kinematics across species on motorized treadmills. However, efforts to decode locomotion speed in more natural contexts$-$where pace is self-selected rather than externally imposed$-$are scarce, generally achieve only modest accuracy, and require intracranial implants. Here, we aim to decode self-paced locomotion speed non-invasively and continuously using cortex-wide EEG recordings from rats. $\textit{Approach.}$ We introduce an asynchronous brain$-$computer interface (BCI) that processes a stream of 32-electrode skull-surface EEG (0.01$-$45 Hz) to decode instantaneous speed from a non-motorized treadmill during self-paced locomotion in head-fixed rats. Using recurrent neural networks and a dataset of over 133 h of recordings, we trained decoders to map ongoing EEG activity to treadmill speed. $\textit{Main results.}$ Our decoding achieves a correlation of 0.88 ($R^2$ = 0.78) for speed, primarily driven by visual cortex electrodes and low-frequency ($< 8$ Hz) oscillations. Moreover, pre-training on a single session permitted decoding on other sessions from the same rat, suggesting uniform neural signatures that generalize across sessions but fail to transfer across animals. Finally, we found that cortical states not only carry information about current speed, but also about future and past dynamics, extending up to 1000 ms. $\textit{Significance.}$ These findings demonstrate that self-paced locomotion speed can be decoded accurately and continuously from non-invasive, cortex-wide EEG. Our approach provides a framework for developing high-performing, non-invasive BCI systems and contributes to understanding distributed neural representations of action dynamics.

TL;DR: 该论文针对视觉世界模型（如DINO-WM）在测试时因"慢速特征"（如背景变化）导致的鲁棒性下降问题，提出引入双模拟编码器来强化控制相关状态的等价性，从而在压缩潜空间的同时提升模型对无关视觉干扰的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜空间预测模型（如JEPAs）对任务无关的慢速视觉特征（如背景变化、干扰物）敏感，导致测试时性能退化，影响智能体在真实复杂环境中的决策可靠性。

Method: 在预测目标函数中增加双模拟编码器，强制将具有相似动态转移的状态映射到相近的潜空间位置，同时抑制慢速特征的贡献。该方法兼容多种预训练视觉编码器（DINOv2/SimDINOv2/iBOT）。

Result: 在含背景变化和视觉干扰的导航任务中，新模型相比DINO-WM显著提升对慢速特征的鲁棒性，潜空间维度最高压缩10倍，且保持多编码器兼容性。

Conclusion: 通过双模拟约束实现控制相关状态的潜空间对齐，是提升世界模型测试鲁棒性的有效途径，为复杂环境下的高效规划提供新思路。

Abstract: World models learned from high-dimensional visual observations allow agents to make decisions and plan directly in latent space, avoiding pixel-level reconstruction. However, recent latent predictive architectures (JEPAs), including the DINO world model (DINO-WM), display a degradation in test time robustness due to their sensitivity to "slow features". These include visual variations such as background changes and distractors that are irrelevant to the task being solved. We address this limitation by augmenting the predictive objective with a bisimulation encoder that enforces control-relevant state equivalence, mapping states with similar transition dynamics to nearby latent states while limiting contributions from slow features. We evaluate our model on a simple navigation task under different test-time background changes and visual distractors. Across all benchmarks, our model consistently improves robustness to slow features while operating in a reduced latent space, up to 10x smaller than that of DINO-WM. Moreover, our model is agnostic to the choice of pretrained visual encoder and maintains robustness when paired with DINOv2, SimDINOv2, and iBOT features.

TL;DR: ARTIST是一个控制器-推理器架构的时序推理模型，通过强化学习自适应选择信息丰富的时序片段而非编码整个序列，在六个基准测试上平均准确率比最强基线高出6.46个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序推理方法无论整个序列是否相关都会将其编码为固定表示，当证据仅出现在少数短区间时效率低下，模型需要主动决定检查哪些片段。

Method: 将时序推理形式化为序列决策问题：采用控制器-推理器架构，控制器通过强化学习选择信息性片段，推理器生成片段条件化的推理轨迹和最终答案；引入分层策略优化方法进行后训练。

Result: 在六个时序推理基准上平均准确率提升6.46绝对百分点，最大提升体现在罕见事件定位和多片段推理任务；监督微调和强化学习分别带来性能增益。

Conclusion: 主动获取任务相关信息（选择性数据使用）比依赖全序列静态摘要更能有效驱动时序推理。

Abstract: Time series reasoning tasks often start with a natural language question and require targeted analysis of a time series. Evidence may span the full series or appear in a few short intervals, so the model must decide what to inspect. Most existing approaches encode the entire time series into a fixed representation before inference, regardless of whether or not the entire sequence is relevant. We introduce ARTIST, which formulates time-series reasoning as a sequential decision problem. ARTIST interleaves reasoning with adaptive temporal segment selection. It adopts a controller-reasoner architecture and uses reinforcement learning to train the controller role to select informative segments and the reasoner role to generate segment-conditioned reasoning traces and final answers. During inference, the model actively acquires task-relevant information instead of relying on a static summary of the full sequence. We use a novel hierarchical policy optimization approach for post-training that allows the model to excel in both segment selection and question-answering behavior. We evaluate ARTIST on six time-series reasoning benchmarks and compare it with large language models, vision-language models, and prior time-series reasoning systems. ARTIST improves average accuracy by 6.46 absolute percentage points over the strongest baseline. The largest gains appear on rare event localization and multi-segment reasoning tasks. Supervised fine-tuning improves performance, and reinforcement learning provides additional gains by optimizing question-adaptive segment selection. These results show that selective data use drives effective time-series reasoning.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Training diffusion models typically relies on manually tuned noise schedules, which can waste computation on weakly informative noise regions and limit transfer across datasets, resolutions, and representations. We revisit noise schedule allocation through an information-theoretic lens and propose the conditional entropy rate of the forward process as a theoretically grounded, data-dependent diagnostic for identifying suboptimal noise-level allocation in existing schedules. Based on these insight, we introduce InfoNoise, a principled data-adaptive training noise schedule that replaces heuristic schedule design with an information-guided noise sampling distribution derived from entropy-reduction rates estimated from denoising losses already computed during training. Across natural-image benchmarks, InfoNoise matches or surpasses tuned EDM-style schedules, in some cases with a substantial training speedup (about $1.4\times$ on CIFAR-10). On discrete datasets, where standard image-tuned schedules exhibit significant mismatch, it reaches superior quality in up to $3\times$ fewer training steps. Overall, InfoNoise makes noise scheduling data-adaptive, reducing the need for per-dataset schedule design as diffusion models expand across domains.

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试上，Potara consistently提升个性化性能，减少通信开销，实现性能与通信的优异权衡

Conclusion: Potara为联邦个性化提供了一种原则性、理论可解释且高效的框架，优于启发式方法

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA, offer a practical way to adapt large vision and language models to client tasks. However, this becomes particularly challenging under task-level heterogeneity in federated deployments. In this regime, personalization requires balancing general knowledge with personalized knowledge, yet existing approaches largely rely on heuristic mixing rules and lack theoretical justification. Moreover, prior model merging approaches are also computation and communication intensive, making the process inefficient in federated settings. In this work, we propose Potara, a principled framework for federated personalization that constructs a personalized model for each client by merging two complementary models: (i) a federated model capturing general knowledge, and (ii) a local model capturing personalized knowledge. Through the construct of linear mode connectivity, we show that the expected task loss admits a variance trace upper bound, whose minimization yields closed-form optimal mixing weights that guarantee a tighter bound for the merged model than for either the federated or local model alone. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that Potara consistently improves personalization while reducing communication, leading to a strong performance-communication trade-off.

Motivation: 传统因果发现方法是针对特定数据集的，限制了多数据集预训练的潜力。现有方法变量数量有限，在大规模输入时性能下降，且过度依赖合成数据，泛化能力差。

Method: 提出一个原则性框架，结合多样化的合成生成器与真实时间序列数据集，实现LCMs的可扩展预训练。

Conclusion: LCMs为时间因果发现提供了一种有前景的基础模型范式，实现了可扩展预训练和强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Causal discovery for both cross-sectional and temporal data has traditionally followed a dataset-specific paradigm, where a new model is fitted for each individual dataset. Such an approach limits the potential of multi-dataset pretraining. The concept of large causal models (LCMs) envisions a class of pre-trained neural architectures specifically designed for temporal causal discovery. Prior approaches are constrained to small variable counts, degrade with larger inputs, and rely heavily on synthetic data, limiting generalization. We propose a principled framework for LCMs, combining diverse synthetic generators with realistic time-series datasets, allowing learning at scale. Extensive experiments on synthetic, semi-synthetic and realistic benchmarks show that LCMs scale effectively to higher variable counts and deeper architectures while maintaining strong performance. Trained models achieve competitive or superior accuracy compared to classical and neural baselines, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, while enabling fast, single-pass inference. Results demonstrate LCMs as a promising foundation-model paradigm for temporal causal discovery. Experiments and model weights are available at https://github.com/kougioulis/LCM-paper/.

TL;DR: I-TAP是一个离线强化学习框架，它将上下文适应与在线规划统一在学习的离散时间抽象空间中，通过在令牌空间进行蒙特卡洛树搜索来解决连续控制中的部分可观测和动态变化问题，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于规划的强化学习在连续控制中面临两大瓶颈：一是在原始时间尺度上进行规划会导致巨大的分支因子和过长的规划视野；二是真实环境通常是部分可观测的，并且存在动态机制转移，这使得传统的静态、完全可观测动力学假设失效。

Method: I-TAP框架从离线轨迹中学习一个观察条件化的残差量化VAE，将观察-宏动作段压缩为离散残差令牌栈，以及一个从短期历史中自回归预测这些令牌栈的时间Transformer。该序列模型同时作为抽象动作的上下文条件化先验和潜在动力学模型。在测试时，I-TAP直接在令牌空间执行蒙特卡洛树搜索，利用短期历史进行无需梯度更新的隐式适应，并将选定的令牌栈解码为可执行动作。

Result: 在确定性MuJoCo、具有每episode潜在动力学机制的随机MuJoCo，以及高维Adroit操作任务（包括部分可观测变体）上，I-TAP持续匹配或超越强大的无模型和基于模型的离线基线，证明了其在随机动力学和部分可观测条件下进行高效且鲁棒的上下文规划的能力。

Conclusion: I-TAP提供了一种有效的离线RL方法，能够统一处理连续控制中的上下文适应、在线规划、部分可观测性和非平稳动力学问题。

Abstract: Planning-based reinforcement learning for continuous control is bottlenecked by two practical issues: planning at primitive time scales leads to prohibitive branching and long horizons, while real environments are frequently partially observable and exhibit regime shifts that invalidate stationary, fully observed dynamics assumptions. We introduce I-TAP (In-Context Latent Temporal-Abstraction Planner), an offline RL framework that unifies in-context adaptation with online planning in a learned discrete temporal-abstraction space. From offline trajectories, I-TAP learns an observation-conditioned residual-quantization VAE that compresses each observation-macro-action segment into a coarse-to-fine stack of discrete residual tokens, and a temporal Transformer that autoregressively predicts these token stacks from a short recent history. The resulting sequence model acts simultaneously as a context-conditioned prior over abstract actions and a latent dynamics model. At test time, I-TAP performs Monte Carlo Tree Search directly in token space, using short histories for implicit adaptation without gradient update, and decodes selected token stacks into executable actions. Across deterministic MuJoCo, stochastic MuJoCo with per-episode latent dynamics regimes, and high-dimensional Adroit manipulation, including partially observable variants, I-TAP consistently matches or outperforms strong model-free and model-based offline baselines, demonstrating efficient and robust in-context planning under stochastic dynamics and partial observability.

Abstract: In many domains generating variable length sequences through insertions provides greater flexibility over autoregressive models. However, the action space of insertion models is much larger than that of autoregressive models (ARMs) making the learning challenging. To address this, we incorporate trainable order dynamics into the target rates for discrete flow matching, and show that with suitable choices of parameterizations, joint training of the target order dynamics and the generator is tractable without the need for numerical simulation. As the generative insertion model, we use a variable length masked diffusion model, which generates by inserting and filling mask tokens. On graph traversal tasks for which a locally optimal insertion order is known, we explore the choices of parameterization empirically and demonstrate the trade-offs between flexibility, training stability and generation quality. On de novo small molecule generation, we find that the learned order dynamics leads to an increase in the number of valid molecules generated and improved quality, when compared to uniform order dynamics.

*Mingdong Lu,Zhikui Chen,Meng Liu,Shubin Ma,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出相位一致的磁性谱学习用于无监督多视图聚类，通过将跨视图方向一致性建模为相位项并结合幅度信息形成复数值磁性亲和力，提取稳定的共享谱信号以指导表示学习和聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督多视图聚类旨在利用多视图互补信息进行分组，但核心挑战是在视图差异和噪声下获得可靠的共享结构信号；现有方法依赖仅幅度亲和力或早期伪目标，在视图具有可比强度但矛盾方向倾向时不稳定。

Method: 提出相位一致的磁性谱学习：将跨视图方向一致性建模为相位项，与幅度结合形成复数值磁性亲和力，通过厄米特磁性拉普拉斯提取共享谱信号，并用作结构化自监督；采用基于锚点的高阶共识建模和轻量 refinement 以抑制噪声。

Result: 在多个公共多视图基准上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续优于强基线。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提供稳定的共享谱信号，有效提升了无监督多视图聚类性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to partition data into meaningful groups by leveraging complementary information from multiple views without labels, yet a central challenge is to obtain a reliable shared structural signal to guide representation learning and cross-view alignment under view discrepancy and noise. Existing approaches often rely on magnitude-only affinities or early pseudo targets, which can be unstable when different views induce relations with comparable strengths but contradictory directional tendencies, thereby distorting the global spectral geometry and degrading clustering. In this paper, we propose \emph{Phase-Consistent Magnetic Spectral Learning} for MVC: we explicitly model cross-view directional agreement as a phase term and combine it with a nonnegative magnitude backbone to form a complex-valued magnetic affinity, extract a stable shared spectral signal via a Hermitian magnetic Laplacian, and use it as structured self-supervision to guide unsupervised multi-view representation learning and clustering. To obtain robust inputs for spectral extraction at scale, we construct a compact shared structure with anchor-based high-order consensus modeling and apply a lightweight refinement to suppress noisy or inconsistent relations. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.

### [30] [Prior Aware Memorization: An Efficient Metric for Distinguishing Memorization from Generalization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18733)
*Trishita Tiwari,Ari Trachtenberg,G. Edward Suh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Prior-Aware Memorization, a lightweight training-free method to distinguish genuine LLM training data memorization from statistical commonality, revealing that most sequences previously labeled as memorized are actually common patterns, thus providing more accurate assessment of data leakage risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training data leakage from LLMs raises privacy, security, and copyright concerns. A key challenge is distinguishing genuine memorization from generation of statistically common sequences. Existing methods conflate these phenomena, and the accurate Counterfactual Memorization approach is computationally expensive due to requiring multiple model retraining.

Method: Introduces Prior-Aware Memorization, a theoretically grounded, training-free criterion that evaluates whether a candidate suffix is strongly associated with its specific training prefix or appears with high probability across unrelated prompts due to statistical commonality.

Result: Evaluation on LLaMA and OPT training corpora shows 55-90% of previously labeled memorized sequences are statistically common. On the SATML dataset, ~40% of sequences exhibit common-pattern behavior despite appearing only once in training data, demonstrating low frequency alone is insufficient evidence of memorization.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the critical importance of accounting for model priors when assessing leakage. Prior-Aware Memorization provides a more accurate, scalable approach to identifying genuine memorization, correcting overestimations in previous leakage assessments.

Abstract: Training data leakage from Large Language Models (LLMs) raises serious concerns related to privacy, security, and copyright compliance. A central challenge in assessing this risk is distinguishing genuine memorization of training data from the generation of statistically common sequences. Existing approaches to measuring memorization often conflate these phenomena, labeling outputs as memorized even when they arise from generalization over common patterns. Counterfactual Memorization provides a principled solution by comparing models trained with and without a target sequence, but its reliance on retraining multiple baseline models makes it computationally expensive and impractical at scale.
  This work introduces Prior-Aware Memorization, a theoretically grounded, lightweight and training-free criterion for identifying genuine memorization in LLMs. The key idea is to evaluate whether a candidate suffix is strongly associated with its specific training prefix or whether it appears with high probability across many unrelated prompts due to statistical commonality.
  We evaluate this metric on text from the training corpora of two pre-trained models, LLaMA and OPT, using both long sequences (to simulate copyright risks) and named entities (to simulate PII leakage). Our results show that between 55% and 90% of sequences previously labeled as memorized are in fact statistically common. Similar findings hold for the SATML training data extraction challenge dataset, where roughly 40% of sequences exhibit common-pattern behavior despite appearing only once in the training data. These results demonstrate that low frequency alone is insufficient evidence of memorization and highlight the importance of accounting for model priors when assessing leakage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出首个针对生成式世界模型的物理条件攻击方法PhysCond-WMA，通过扰动HDMap和3D-box等物理条件通道，在保持感知质量的同时实现语义和决策层面的攻击，揭示了自动驾驶生成模型的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式世界模型在合成可控驾驶视频时依赖物理先验，这带来了新的攻击面。现有研究缺乏对这类模型安全漏洞的系统性探索，特别是通过物理条件通道发起攻击的可能性。

Method: 提出PhysCond-WMA两阶段攻击框架：1)质量保持引导阶段，通过校准阈值约束反向扩散损失；2)动量引导去噪阶段，沿去噪轨迹累积目标对齐梯度以实现稳定连贯的语义篡改。

Result: 实验表明该方法平均提升FID约9%、FVD约3.9%，目标攻击成功率ASR达0.55。下游研究显示，使用受攻击视频训练会使3D检测性能下降约4%，开环规划性能恶化约20%。

Conclusion: 首次揭示并量化了生成式世界模型的安全漏洞，证明了物理条件通道的脆弱性，推动了更全面的安全检测机制发展。

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) are increasingly used to synthesize controllable, sensor-conditioned driving videos, yet their reliance on physical priors exposes novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we present Physical-Conditioned World Model Attack (PhysCond-WMA), the first white-box world model attack that perturbs physical-condition channels, such as HDMap embeddings and 3D-box features, to induce semantic, logic, or decision-level distortion while preserving perceptual fidelity. PhysCond-WMA is optimized in two stages: (1) a quality-preserving guidance stage that constrains reverse-diffusion loss below a calibrated threshold, and (2) a momentum-guided denoising stage that accumulates target-aligned gradients along the denoising trajectory for stable, temporally coherent semantic shifts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach remains effective while increasing FID by about 9% on average and FVD by about 3.9% on average. Under the targeted attack setting, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 0.55. Downstream studies further show tangible risk, which using attacked videos for training decreases 3D detection performance by about 4%, and worsens open-loop planning performance by about 20%. These findings has for the first time revealed and quantified security vulnerabilities in generative world models, driving more comprehensive security checkers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 广告排序系统需要同时优化CTR、CVR、收入等多目标，但面临两大挑战：1) 流量分段间的分数尺度不一致导致阈值不可迁移；2) 点击日志中的位置偏差造成离线与在线指标差异

Method: 采用三阶段方法：将分数校准作为训练目标而非后处理、使用拉格朗日松弛进行约束优化、采用方差缩减的反事实估计器进行可靠离线评估

Result: 在Criteo和Avazu数据集上实现：1.1%相对AUC提升、31.6%校准误差降低、3.2%效用增益，且在多流量分段保持稳定性能

Conclusion: CaliCausalRank作为统一框架有效解决了生产环境中的尺度一致性和偏差问题，相比PairRank等基线方法取得显著改进

Abstract: Ad ranking systems must simultaneously optimize multiple objectives including click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), revenue, and user experience metrics. However, production systems face critical challenges: score scale inconsistency across traffic segments undermines threshold transferability, and position bias in click logs causes offline-online metric discrepancies. We propose CaliCausalRank, a unified framework that integrates training-time scale calibration, constraint-based multi-objective optimization, and robust counterfactual utility estimation. Our approach treats score calibration as a first-class training objective rather than post-hoc processing, employs Lagrangian relaxation for constraint satisfaction, and utilizes variance-reduced counterfactual estimators for reliable offline evaluation. Experiments on the Criteo and Avazu datasets demonstrate that CaliCausalRank achieves 1.1% relative AUC improvement, 31.6% calibration error reduction, and 3.2% utility gain compared to the best baseline (PairRank) while maintaining consistent performance across different traffic segments.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is critical for identifying abnormal nodes in graph-structured data from diverse domains, including cybersecurity and social networks. The existing GAD methods often focus on the learning paradigms of "one-model-for-one-dataset", requiring dataset-specific training for each dataset to achieve optimal performance. However, this paradigm suffers from significant limitations, such as high computational and data costs, limited generalization and transferability to new datasets, and challenges in privacy-sensitive scenarios where access to full datasets or sufficient labels is restricted. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalist GAD paradigm that aims to develop a unified model capable of detecting anomalies on multiple unseen datasets without extensive retraining/fine-tuning or dataset-specific customization. To this end, we propose ARC, a few-shot generalist GAD method that leverages in-context learning and requires only a few labeled normal samples at inference time. Specifically, ARC consists of three core modules: a feature Alignment module to unify and align features across datasets, a Residual GNN encoder to capture dataset-agnostic anomaly representations, and a cross-attentive in-Context learning module to score anomalies using few-shot normal context. Building on ARC, we further introduce ARC_zero for the zero-shot generalist GAD setting, which selects representative pseudo-normal nodes via a pseudo-context mechanism and thus enables fully label-free inference on unseen datasets. Extensive experiments on 17 real-world graph datasets demonstrate that both ARC and ARC_zero effectively detect anomalies, exhibit strong generalization ability, and perform efficiently under few-shot and zero-shot settings.

*Zheng Wang,Nizar Bouguila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Latent Dirichlet-Tree Allocation (LDTA), a generalization of LDA that replaces the Dirichlet prior with Dirichlet-Tree distributions to model hierarchical topic relationships. It develops vectorized variational inference and Expectation Propagation with GPU acceleration, expanding LDA's modeling capacity while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDA's Dirichlet prior cannot capture rich topic correlations and hierarchical structures present in real-world data, limiting its expressiveness.

Method: 1) Replace Dirichlet prior with arbitrary Dirichlet-Tree distributions; 2) Develop universal mean-field variational inference and Expectation Propagation with tractable updates; 3) Derive vectorized formulations theoretically; 4) Implement fully vectorized GPU-accelerated versions.

Result: The framework substantially expands LDA's modeling capacity, enables scalable inference for all Dirichlet-Tree distributions, and achieves high computational efficiency through vectorization and GPU acceleration.

Conclusion: LDTA provides a more expressive and scalable solution for discovering hierarchical thematic structures in discrete data while preserving LDA's generative framework and efficiency.

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a foundational model for discovering latent thematic structure in discrete data, but its Dirichlet prior cannot represent the rich correlations and hierarchical relationships often present among topics. We introduce the framework of Latent Dirichlet-Tree Allocation (LDTA), a generalization of LDA that replaces the Dirichlet prior with an arbitrary Dirichlet-Tree (DT) distribution. LDTA preserves LDA's generative structure but enables expressive, tree-structured priors over topic proportions. To perform inference, we develop universal mean-field variational inference and Expectation Propagation, providing tractable updates for all DT. We reveal the vectorized nature of the two inference methods through theoretical development, and perform fully vectorized, GPU-accelerated implementations. The resulting framework substantially expands the modeling capacity of LDA while maintaining scalability and computational efficiency.

### [35] [Exact Attention Sensitivity and the Geometry of Transformer Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18849)
*Seyed Morteza Emadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个Transformer稳定性理论，从第一原理解释了pre-LayerNorm有效、DeepNorm采用N^-1/4缩放以及warmup必要性的原因，发现稳定性源于架构的梯度流而非注意力动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer驱动现代AI，但其训练仍然神秘地脆弱。需要从第一原理解释为什么pre-LayerNorm有效、DeepNorm使用N^-1/4缩放以及warmup为何必要。

Method: 建立双支柱稳定性理论框架：(1) 推导softmax Jacobian的精确算子范数；(2) 引入与token计算对齐的block-∞/RMS几何结构，获得与序列长度无关的Lipschitz界。

Result: 证明pre-LN保持恒等梯度路径而post-LN指数级累积LayerNorm Jacobian；DeepNorm的N^-1/4源于注意力四个投影矩阵的四次结构；774M参数模型验证显示θ(p)≈1持续存在，与注意力锐化预期相反。

Conclusion: Transformer稳定性完全源于架构梯度流而非注意力动态，这意味着训练稳定性应由架构本身而非学习的注意力模式来保障。

Abstract: Despite powering modern AI, transformers remain mysteriously brittle to train. We develop a stability theory that explains why pre-LayerNorm works, why DeepNorm uses $N^{-1/4}$ scaling, and why warmup is necessary, all from first principles. Our framework has two pillars: (1) We derive the \emph{exact} operator norm of the softmax Jacobian, $\|J_{softmax}(u/τ)\|_{\infty\to 1} = θ(p)/τ$, where the balanced-mass factor $θ(p)\in[0,1]$ quantifies attention sensitivity. (2) We introduce a block-$\infty$/RMS geometry aligned with tokenwise computation, yielding Lipschitz bounds independent of sequence length. Using this framework, we prove that pre-LN preserves identity gradient paths while post-LN compounds LayerNorm Jacobians exponentially with depth, and we show that DeepNorm's $N^{-1/4}$ emerges from the quartic structure of attention's four projection matrices. We validate our theory on 774M-parameter models and find that, contrary to the intuition that attention sharpens during training to reduce sensitivity, $θ(p) \approx 1$ persists throughout. Transformer stability arises entirely from architectural gradient flow, not from attention dynamics. This finding changes how we reason about training: the architecture itself must handle sensitivity, not learned attention patterns.

*Seyed Morteza Emadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文推导了Transformer注意力分数的秩感知集中不等式，比先前工作紧致8-28倍。基于此的几何感知缩放可在GPT-2 XL到Llama-2-70B等大规模模型上消除FP8溢出，同时保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前注意力分数的秩无关集中不等式过于宽松，导致低精度（FP8）训练中的溢出预防过于保守。注意力分数S_ij = x_i^T M x_j / sqrt(d_h)的最大幅度决定溢出风险，但现有界限未考虑交互矩阵M = W^Q W^{K^T}的低秩结构。

Method: 论文推导秩感知集中不等式：当秩r << d时，max |S_ij|的尾部概率以exp(-d²α²/(γr))衰减，而非秩无关的exp(-dα²)。针对FP8训练，通过隐式幂迭代计算谱范数||W^Q W^{K^T}||_2来得到每层缩放因子，包含分组查询注意力公式，且兼容融合注意力核。

Result: 几何感知缩放在延迟缩放失败的瞬态场景中消除溢出，同时达到相当的MMLU下游精度。该方法在GPT-2 XL到Llama-2-70B模型上验证，提供比秩无关方法紧致8-28倍的界限。

Conclusion: 秩感知不等式为注意力分数幅度提供更紧致的保证。几何感知缩放提供原则性的FP8训练方案，在不损失精度的情况下防止溢出，在大规模Transformer架构中证明有效。

Abstract: Attention scores in transformers are bilinear forms $S_{ij} = x_i^\top M x_j / \sqrt{d_h}$ whose maximum magnitude governs overflow risk in low-precision training. We derive a \emph{rank-aware concentration inequality}: when the interaction matrix $M = W^Q W^{K\top}$ has rank $r \ll d$, tail probabilities for $\max_{i,j}|S_{ij}|$ decay as $\exp(-d^{2}α^{2}/(γr))$ rather than $\exp(-dα^{2})$, where $γ> 1$ is a typicality parameter. For transformer attention where $r = d_h$, this yields $8$--$28\times$ tighter concentration than rank-agnostic bounds in modern architectures. We apply this result to FP8 training, deriving \emph{geometry-aware scale factors} that provide principled overflow guarantees without observing activations. The method computes per-layer scales from the spectral norm $\|W^Q W^{K\top}\|_2$ via implicit power iteration, includes a grouped query attention formulation that avoids key expansion, and remains compatible with fused attention kernels. Across GPT-2 XL to Llama-2-70B, geometry-aware scaling eliminates overflows in transient scenarios where delayed scaling fails, while achieving comparable downstream MMLU accuracy.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了非表格强化学习中基于随机权重猜测(RWG)的任务复杂度度量方法(PIC和POIC)，在机器人操作任务中发现这些指标得出反直觉结论，凸显了开发更可靠的非表格RL复杂度度量方法的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习中，衡量任务复杂度对于创建有意义基准和设计有效课程学习至关重要。虽然表格设置中已有成熟的复杂度指标，但在非表格领域（如机器人控制）中此类指标较少，现有基于随机权重猜测(RWG)的方法存在局限性。

Method: 通过在已知相对复杂度的渐进式机器人操作环境中，使用密集和稀疏奖励形式，实证评估了三种复杂度度量方法：随机权重猜测(RWG)、策略信息容量(PIC)和策略最优信息容量(POIC)。

Result: 实证结果显示PIC和POIC均产生反直觉的评估结果：1)在相同奖励形式下，PIC认为两连杆机械臂比单连杆更简单，这与机器人控制和RL经验相矛盾；2)POIC估计稀疏奖励任务比密集奖励任务更容易，这与典型的RL实证结果不符。

Conclusion: 基于RWG的指标在捕捉非表格强化学习任务复杂度方面存在根本缺陷，需要超越这些方法，开发能更可靠反映真实任务复杂度的度量标准，该研究的任务框架可作为起点。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled major advances in fields such as robotics and natural language processing. A key challenge in RL is measuring task complexity, which is essential for creating meaningful benchmarks and designing effective curricula. While there are numerous well-established metrics for assessing task complexity in tabular settings, relatively few exist in non-tabular domains. These include (i) Statistical analysis of the performance of random policies via Random Weight Guessing (RWG), and (ii) information-theoretic metrics Policy Information Capacity (PIC) and Policy-Optimal Information Capacity (POIC), which are reliant on RWG. In this paper, we evaluate these methods using progressively difficult robotic manipulation setups, with known relative complexity, with both dense and sparse reward formulations. Our empirical results reveal that measuring complexity is still nuanced. Specifically, under the same reward formulation, PIC suggests that a two-link robotic arm setup is easier than a single-link setup - which contradicts the robotic control and empirical RL perspective whereby the two-link setup is inherently more complex. Likewise, for the same setup, POIC estimates that tasks with sparse rewards are easier than those with dense rewards. Thus, we show that both PIC and POIC contradict typical understanding and empirical results from RL. These findings highlight the need to move beyond RWG-based metrics towards better metrics that can more reliably capture task complexity in non-tabular RL with our task framework as a starting point.

Abstract: Optimally trading-off exploration and exploitation is the holy grail of reinforcement learning as it promises maximal data-efficiency for solving any task. Bayes-optimal agents achieve this, but obtaining the belief-state and performing planning are both typically intractable. Although deep learning methods can greatly help in scaling this computation, existing methods are still costly to train. To accelerate this, this paper proposes a variational framework for learning and planning in Bayes-adaptive Markov decision processes that coalesces variational belief learning, sequential Monte-Carlo planning, and meta-reinforcement learning. In a single-GPU setup, our new method VariBASeD exhibits favorable scaling to larger planning budgets, improving sample- and runtime-efficiency over prior methods.

Motivation: 现有提升理论局限于标量损失，对向量值预测和条件密度估计等非结构化场景缺乏系统分析，需建立一般散度下的理论框架。

Method: 定义(α,β)-可提升性稳定性条件；采用几何中位数聚合策略；构建GeoMedBoost框架，结合指数重加权与几何中位数。

Result: 证明几何中位数对ℓ₁、ℓ₂、TV、Hellinger等散度具有维度相关/无关的boostability；KL散度可通过Hellinger距离间接处理；经验误差呈指数衰减。

Conclusion: 该工作为结构化预测提供统一几何视角，涵盖MedBoost、AdaBoost、SAMME等算法，扩展了提升理论的应用边界。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of boosting in structured prediction, a general theoretical understanding of aggregation beyond scalar losses remains incomplete. We study vector-valued and conditional density prediction under general divergences and identify stability conditions under which aggregation amplifies weak guarantees into strong ones.
  We formalize this stability property as \emph{$(α,β)$-boostability}. We show that geometric median aggregation achieves $(α,β)$-boostability for a broad class of divergences, with tradeoffs that depend on the underlying geometry. For vector-valued prediction and conditional density estimation, we characterize boostability under common divergences ($\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, $\TV$, and $\Hel$) with geometric median, revealing a sharp distinction between dimension-dependent and dimension-free regimes. We further show that while KL divergence is not directly boostable via geometric median aggregation, it can be handled indirectly through boostability under Hellinger distance.
  Building on these structural results, we propose a generic boosting framework \textsc{GeoMedBoost} based on exponential reweighting and geometric-median aggregation. Under a weak learner condition and $(α,β)$-boostability, we obtain exponential decay of the empirical divergence exceedance error. Our framework recovers classical algorithms such as \textsc{MedBoost}, \textsc{AdaBoost}, and \textsc{SAMME} as special cases, and provides a unified geometric view of boosting for structured prediction.

Motivation: 向量量化自编码器存在不可微、需直通估计、易崩溃等固有缺陷。

Method: 采用Oja规则训练的在线PCA瓶颈层替换VQ，学习正交方差排序的潜在基，无需码本。

Result: 在CelebAHQ上重建质量优于VQ-GAN和SimVQ，比特使用减少10-100倍，且潜在维度天然可解释。

Conclusion: PCA是VQ的有效替代，为生成模型提供数学基础好、稳定、高效、语义结构化的新方向。

Abstract: Vector-quantized autoencoders deliver high-fidelity latents but suffer inherent flaws: the quantizer is non-differentiable, requires straight-through hacks, and is prone to collapse. We address these issues at the root by replacing VQ with a simple, principled, and fully differentiable alternative: an online PCA bottleneck trained via Oja's rule. The resulting model, PCA-VAE, learns an orthogonal, variance-ordered latent basis without codebooks, commitment losses, or lookup noise. Despite its simplicity, PCA-VAE exceeds VQ-GAN and SimVQ in reconstruction quality on CelebAHQ while using 10-100x fewer latent bits. It also produces naturally interpretable dimensions (e.g., pose, lighting, gender cues) without adversarial regularization or disentanglement objectives. These results suggest that PCA is a viable replacement for VQ: mathematically grounded, stable, bit-efficient, and semantically structured, offering a new direction for generative models beyond vector quantization.

TL;DR: 提出TRUE框架，通过可执行验证、可行域DAG建模和因果失效分析，在实例、局部和类别三个层面为LLM推理提供可验证的统一解释


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理能力强但决策过程难以解释，现有方法缺乏可信的结构洞察且局限于单实例分析，无法揭示推理稳定性和系统性失效机制

Method: 提出可信赖统一解释框架TRUE，集成可执行推理验证、可行域有向无环图建模和因果失效模式分析：实例层将推理轨迹重定义为可执行过程规范并引入盲执行验证；局部结构层通过结构一致扰动构建可行域DAG；类别层使用Shapley值识别和量化结构性失效模式

Conclusion: 建立了提升LLM推理系统可解释性和可靠性的统一原则性范式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, yet their decision-making processes remain difficult to interpret. Existing explanation methods often lack trustworthy structural insight and are limited to single-instance analysis, failing to reveal reasoning stability and systematic failure mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose the Trustworthy Unified Explanation Framework (TRUE), which integrates executable reasoning verification, feasible-region directed acyclic graph (DAG) modeling, and causal failure mode analysis. At the instance level, we redefine reasoning traces as executable process specifications and introduce blind execution verification to assess operational validity. At the local structural level, we construct feasible-region DAGs via structure-consistent perturbations, enabling explicit characterization of reasoning stability and the executable region in the local input space. At the class level, we introduce a causal failure mode analysis method that identifies recurring structural failure patterns and quantifies their causal influence using Shapley values. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework provides multi-level, verifiable explanations, including executable reasoning structures for individual instances, feasible-region representations for neighboring inputs, and interpretable failure modes with quantified importance at the class level. These results establish a unified and principled paradigm for improving the interpretability and reliability of LLM reasoning systems.

### [42] [DeepInterestGR: Mining Deep Multi-Interest Using Multi-Modal LLMs for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18907)
*Yangchen Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepInterestGR addresses the "Shallow Interest problem" in generative recommendation by mining deep semantic interests using multiple LLMs, labeling them with rewards, and integrating them into Semantic ID generation, achieving superior performance on Amazon benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative recommendation methods rely on shallow textual features (titles/descriptions) and fail to capture latent, semantically rich user interests, limiting personalization depth and interpretability.

Method: Three innovations: (1) Multi-LLM Interest Mining (MLIM) extracts deep textual/visual interests via Chain-of-Thought prompting; (2) Reward-Labeled Deep Interest (RLDI) uses a binary classifier to assign reward labels for RL supervision; (3) Interest-Enhanced Item Discretization (IEID) encodes interests into SID tokens via RQ-VAE. Two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning with Interest-Aware Reward.

Result: Experiments on three Amazon Review benchmarks show DeepInterestGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across HR@K and NDCG@K metrics.

Conclusion: Incorporating deep, semantically rich interest representations mined from multiple LLMs significantly enhances generative recommendation performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Recent generative recommendation frameworks have demonstrated remarkable scaling potential by reformulating item prediction as autoregressive Semantic ID (SID) generation. However, existing methods primarily rely on shallow behavioral signals, encoding items solely through surface-level textual features such as titles and descriptions. This reliance results in a critical Shallow Interest problem: the model fails to capture the latent, semantically rich interests underlying user interactions, limiting both personalization depth and recommendation interpretability. DeepInterestGR introduces three key innovations: (1) Multi-LLM Interest Mining (MLIM): We leverage multiple frontier LLMs along with their multi-modal variants to extract deep textual and visual interest representations through Chain-of-Thought prompting. (2) Reward-Labeled Deep Interest (RLDI): We employ a lightweight binary classifier to assign reward labels to mined interests, enabling effective supervision signals for reinforcement learning. (3) Interest-Enhanced Item Discretization (IEID): The curated deep interests are encoded into semantic embeddings and quantized into SID tokens via RQ-VAE. We adopt a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning aligns the generative model with deep interest signals and collaborative filtering patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with GRPO optimized by our Interest-Aware Reward. Experiments on three Amazon Review benchmarks demonstrate that DeepInterestGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across HR@K and NDCG@K metrics.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种半本地差分隐私(SLDP)框架，通过基于局部密度为用户分配隐私区域，将隐私成本与细化迭代次数解耦，实现高分辨率隐私保护分析，并在真实和合成数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密度自适应域离散化对高效用隐私保护分析至关重要，但在本地差分隐私(LDP)下，由于迭代细化带来的隐私预算消耗，该问题仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出半本地差分隐私(SLDP)框架：基于局部密度为每个用户分配隐私区域，通过点在其隐私区域内的潜在移动定义邻接关系；设计由诚实但好奇服务器通过公共信道协调的交互式(ε, δ)-SLDP协议，以私密估计这些区域。

Result: 关键创新在于将隐私成本与细化迭代次数解耦，可在不增加额外隐私预算的情况下构建高分辨率网格。在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验任务证明了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: SLDP框架通过消除LDP中迭代细化的隐私预算开销，为隐私保护分析中的密度自适应域离散化提供了高效解决方案，使高分辨率分析在严格隐私约束下成为可能。

Abstract: Density-adaptive domain discretization is essential for high-utility privacy-preserving analytics but remains challenging under Local Differential Privacy (LDP) due to the privacy-budget costs associated with iterative refinement. We propose a novel framework, Semi-Local Differential Privacy (SLDP), that assigns a privacy region to each user based on local density and defines adjacency by the potential movement of a point within its privacy region. We present an interactive $(\varepsilon, δ)$-SLDP protocol, orchestrated by an honest-but-curious server over a public channel, to estimate these regions privately. Crucially, our framework decouples the privacy cost from the number of refinement iterations, allowing for high-resolution grids without additional privacy budget cost. We experimentally demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on estimation tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a human-anchored calibration framework to address misleading AI-human comparisons by standardizing benchmark performance relative to global population success probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comparing AI models to "human level" is problematic due to incommensurate benchmarks and narrow human baseline populations.

Method: Develop multi-level capability scales (reasoning, comprehension, knowledge, etc.) where each level represents global population success probability on a log scale. Calibrate using diverse human test data (PISA, TIMSS, ICAR, UKBioBank, ReliabilityBench). Estimate scale base via LLM-based extrapolation between demographic profiles. Validate with group slicing and post-stratification.

Result: Enables recalibration and standardization of AI performance scales relative to the whole-world population.

Conclusion: This framework provides a more accurate foundation for AI-human comparison by anchoring to representative global population metrics rather than limited samples.

Abstract: Comparing AI models to "human level" is often misleading when benchmark scores are incommensurate or human baselines are drawn from a narrow population. To address this, we propose a framework that calibrates items against the 'world population' and report performance on a common, human-anchored scale. Concretely, we build on a set of multi-level scales for different capabilities where each level should represent a probability of success of the whole world population on a logarithmic scale with a base $B$. We calibrate each scale for each capability (reasoning, comprehension, knowledge, volume, etc.) by compiling publicly released human test data spanning education and reasoning benchmarks (PISA, TIMSS, ICAR, UKBioBank, and ReliabilityBench). The base $B$ is estimated by extrapolating between samples with two demographic profiles using LLMs, with the hypothesis that they condense rich information about human populations. We evaluate the quality of different mappings using group slicing and post-stratification. The new techniques allow for the recalibration and standardization of scales relative to the whole-world population.

TL;DR: 提出基于迁移性和模型提取的标签-only成员推理攻击框架，通过一次性提取替代模型将查询开销转移至提取阶段，在严格黑盒约束下显著降低查询成本同时保持攻击性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击面临两大问题：依赖不切实际的假设（如访问公共数据集、影子模型、置信度分数或训练数据分布）导致易受防御措施影响；严格的标签-only攻击每样本查询开销过高，亟需低成本解决方案。

Method: 采用主动采样、基于扰动的样本选择和合成数据生成策略，通过查询目标模型M提取功能相似的替代模型S，将成员推理任务从M转移至S执行，实现查询开销的一次性投入。

Result: 在Purchase、Location和Texas Hospital等基准数据集上，仅需相当于测试约1%训练样本的查询预算即可提取S，实现与目标模型M性能差距在±1%以内的成员推理准确率，且显著优于传统标签-only方法的查询效率。

Conclusion: 该框架在严格黑盒约束下实现了与先进标签-only MIA相当的性能，同时大幅降低查询成本，证明模型提取是提升MIA效率的有效途径，并验证了标准防御措施对该攻击的有效性。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) threaten the privacy of machine learning models by revealing whether a specific data point was used during training. Existing MIAs often rely on impractical assumptions such as access to public datasets, shadow models, confidence scores, or training data distribution knowledge and making them vulnerable to defenses like confidence masking and adversarial regularization. Label-only MIAs, even under strict constraints suffer from high query requirements per sample. We propose a cost-effective label-only MIA framework based on transferability and model extraction. By querying the target model M using active sampling, perturbation-based selection, and synthetic data, we extract a functionally similar surrogate S on which membership inference is performed. This shifts query overhead to a one-time extraction phase, eliminating repeated queries to M . Operating under strict black-box constraints, our method matches the performance of state-of-the-art label-only MIAs while significantly reducing query costs. On benchmarks including Purchase, Location, and Texas Hospital, we show that a query budget equivalent to testing $\approx1\%$ of training samples suffices to extract S and achieve membership inference accuracy within $\pm1\%$ of M . We also evaluate the effectiveness of standard defenses proposed for label-only MIAs against our attack.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文证明了在可分逻辑回归问题中，通过精心设计的步长增长策略，梯度下降和随机梯度下降可以在保持优化过程稳定的同时实现指数级收敛速度，表明加速并不必然需要不稳定的优化轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习中，梯度下降及其随机版本在大步长下的理论行为尚不清晰。现有研究表明加速通常出现在稳定性边缘的不稳定区域，但尚不清楚这种不稳定性是否是实现加速的必要条件。

Method: 针对可分逻辑回归问题，在margin条件下，提出了一种简单的非自适应递增步长调度策略用于梯度下降，以及一种轻量级的自适应步长规则用于随机梯度下降。

Result: 梯度下降方法在保持稳定优化 regime 的同时实现了指数收敛，且该方法是"anytime"的，无需预先知道优化时间范围或目标精度。随机梯度下降也实现了指数收敛，优于现有的多项式速率保证，且避免了线搜索和专用程序。

Conclusion: 精心设计的步长增长策略本身就足以让梯度下降和随机梯度下降实现指数级加速，表明不稳定的优化轨迹并非加速的必要条件。

Abstract: Gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent are central to modern machine learning, yet their behavior under large step sizes remains theoretically unclear. Recent work suggests that acceleration often arises near the edge of stability, where optimization trajectories become unstable and difficult to analyze. Existing results for separable logistic regression achieve faster convergence by explicitly leveraging such unstable regimes through constant or adaptive large step sizes. In this paper, we show that instability is not inherent to acceleration. We prove that gradient descent with a simple, non-adaptive increasing step-size schedule achieves exponential convergence for separable logistic regression under a margin condition, while remaining entirely within a stable optimization regime. The resulting method is anytime and does not require prior knowledge of the optimization horizon or target accuracy. We also establish exponential convergence of stochastic gradient descent using a lightweight adaptive step-size rule that avoids line search and specialized procedures, improving upon existing polynomial-rate guarantees. Together, our results demonstrate that carefully structured step-size growth alone suffices to obtain exponential acceleration for both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transformer models contain substantial internal redundancy arising from coordinate-dependent representations and continuous symmetries, in model space and in head space, respectively. While recent approaches address this by explicitly breaking symmetry, we propose a complementary framework based on symmetry reduction. We reformulate representations, attention mechanisms, and optimization dynamics in terms of invariant relational quantities, eliminating redundant degrees of freedom by construction. This perspective yields architectures that operate directly on relational structures, providing a principled geometric framework for reducing parameter redundancy and analyzing optimization.

TL;DR: 提出增量式Transformer神经过程(incTNP)，通过因果掩码、KV缓存和自回归训练，实现与标准TNP相当的预测性能，同时将流式数据更新的计算复杂度从二次降至线性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经过程模型(如TNP)处理时序数据流时需全量重计算，无法满足实时传感器等场景对增量更新和计算效率的需求。

Method: 借鉴大语言模型技术：采用因果掩码保证时序因果性、KV缓存避免重复计算、数据高效的自回归训练策略，构建支持增量更新的incTNP架构。

Result: 在合成与真实任务(表格回归/温度预测)中：1) 预测性能媲美甚至超越非因果TNP；2) 流式推理实现数量级加速；3) 保持与标准TNP相当的隐式贝叶斯一致性。

Conclusion: incTNP通过因果掩码与缓存机制，在维持贝叶斯推断一致性的前提下，为时序数据流提供了计算高效的增量学习解决方案，拓展了神经过程在实时场景的应用潜力。

Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs), and specifically Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs), have demonstrated remarkable performance across tasks ranging from spatiotemporal forecasting to tabular data modelling. However, many of these applications are inherently sequential, involving continuous data streams such as real-time sensor readings or database updates. In such settings, models should support cheap, incremental updates rather than recomputing internal representations from scratch for every new observation -- a capability existing TNP variants lack. Drawing inspiration from Large Language Models, we introduce the Incremental TNP (incTNP). By leveraging causal masking, Key-Value (KV) caching, and a data-efficient autoregressive training strategy, incTNP matches the predictive performance of standard TNPs while reducing the computational cost of updates from quadratic to linear time complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including tabular regression and temperature prediction. Our results show that, surprisingly, incTNP delivers performance comparable to -- or better than -- non-causal TNPs while unlocking orders-of-magnitude speedups for sequential inference. Finally, we assess the consistency of the model's updates -- by adapting a metric of ``implicit Bayesianness", we show that incTNP retains a prediction rule as implicitly Bayesian as standard non-causal TNPs, demonstrating that incTNP achieves the computational benefits of causal masking without sacrificing the consistency required for streaming inference.

TL;DR: Proposes CoSiNE, a neural network-parameterized continuous-time Markov chain that captures epistatic effects in antibody evolution, outperforming language models and enabling guided optimization


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods ignore affinity maturation's evolutionary process information and treat sequences as independent samples, while classical phylogenetic models lack expressivity to capture complex epistatic interactions.

Method: CoSiNE: a continuous-time Markov chain parameterized by deep neural network; Guided Gillespie: classifier-guided sampling scheme for inference-time steering.

Result: Provides first-order approximation with quadratic error bound; outperforms state-of-the-art language models in zero-shot variant effect prediction by disentangling selection from somatic hypermutation.

Conclusion: Successfully bridges the gap between phylogenetic models and deep learning, enabling efficient optimization of antibody binding affinity toward specific antigens.

Abstract: Common deep learning approaches for antibody engineering focus on modeling the marginal distribution of sequences. By treating sequences as independent samples, however, these methods overlook affinity maturation as a rich and largely untapped source of information about the evolutionary process by which antibodies explore the underlying fitness landscape. In contrast, classical phylogenetic models explicitly represent evolutionary dynamics but lack the expressivity to capture complex epistatic interactions. We bridge this gap with CoSiNE, a continuous-time Markov chain parameterized by a deep neural network. Mathematically, we prove that CoSiNE provides a first-order approximation to the intractable sequential point mutation process, capturing epistatic effects with an error bound that is quadratic in branch length. Empirically, CoSiNE outperforms state-of-the-art language models in zero-shot variant effect prediction by explicitly disentangling selection from context-dependent somatic hypermutation. Finally, we introduce Guided Gillespie, a classifier-guided sampling scheme that steers CoSiNE at inference time, enabling efficient optimization of antibody binding affinity toward specific antigens.

Motivation: 传统成员推理攻击被动分析固定模型权重，而训练数据相比非训练数据具有更高的可重构性，这一特性可用于改进成员检测效果

Method: 设计主动攻击框架ADRA，利用强化学习对目标模型进行微调，通过重构指标和对比奖励主动诱导模型重构文本，利用成员与非成员数据的可重构性差异进行成员推理

Result: ADRA及自适应变体ADRA+在预训练、后训练和蒸馏数据检测上平均提升10.7%，在BookMIA和AIME上分别比Min-K%++提升18.8%和7.6%

Conclusion: 主动数据重构是有效的成员推理攻击策略，证明了利用可重构性差异可高精度检测成员数据，为LLM数据隐私研究提供了新方向

Abstract: Detecting LLM training data is generally framed as a membership inference attack (MIA) problem. However, conventional MIAs operate passively on fixed model weights, using log-likelihoods or text generations. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Active Data Reconstruction Attack} (ADRA), a family of MIA that actively induces a model to reconstruct a given text through training. We hypothesize that training data are \textit{more reconstructible} than non-members, and the difference in their reconstructibility can be exploited for membership inference. Motivated by findings that reinforcement learning (RL) sharpens behaviors already encoded in weights, we leverage on-policy RL to actively elicit data reconstruction by finetuning a policy initialized from the target model. To effectively use RL for MIA, we design reconstruction metrics and contrastive rewards. The resulting algorithms, \textsc{ADRA} and its adaptive variant \textsc{ADRA+}, improve both reconstruction and detection given a pool of candidate data. Experiments show that our methods consistently outperform existing MIAs in detecting pre-training, post-training, and distillation data, with an average improvement of 10.7\% over the previous runner-up. In particular, \MethodPlus~improves over Min-K\%++ by 18.8\% on BookMIA for pre-training detection and by 7.6\% on AIME for post-training detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子核方法在近-term量子机器学习中很有前景，但其在数据损坏下的行为尚未得到充分理解，特别是在NISQ时代需要了解这些方法的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种混合构造——谱相位编码(SPE)，将离散傅里叶变换前端与对齐对角量子映射几何的对角相位嵌入相结合；在统一框架下比较了QK-DFT与QK-PCA、QK-RP等量子变体以及经典SVM基线；使用数据集固定效应回归和wild cluster bootstrap推断；在异构真实数据集上进行了测试，并进行了硬件实验验证。

Result: DFT预处理在噪声增加时表现出最小的退化率，与PCA和RP相比有统计显著性差异；QK-DFT的退化与线性SVM相当，比RBF SVM更稳定；硬件实验证实SPE可执行且数值稳定。

Conclusion: 量子核的鲁棒性关键取决于结构对齐的预处理及其对角嵌入的交互，这支持了NISQ时代量子机器学习的"鲁棒性优先"视角。

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are promising for near-term quantum ma- chine learning, yet their behavior under data corruption remains insuf- ficiently understood. We analyze how quantum feature constructions degrade under controlled additive noise. We introduce Spectral Phase Encoding (SPE), a hybrid construc- tion combining a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) front-end with a diagonal phase-only embedding aligned with the geometry of diagonal quantum maps. Within a unified framework, we compare QK-DFT against alternative quantum variants (QK-PCA, QK-RP) and classi- cal SVM baselines under identical clean-data hyperparameter selection, quantifying robustness via dataset fixed-effects regression with wild cluster bootstrap inference across heterogeneous real-world datasets. Across the quantum family, DFT-based preprocessing yields the smallest degradation rate as noise increases, with statistically sup- ported slope differences relative to PCA and RP. Compared to classical baselines, QK-DFT shows degradation comparable to linear SVM and more stable than RBF SVM under matched tuning. Hardware exper- iments confirm that SPE remains executable and numerically stable for overlap estimation. These results indicate that robustness in quan- tum kernels depends critically on structure-aligned preprocessing and its interaction with diagonal embeddings, supporting a robustness-first perspective for NISQ-era quantum machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆光刻(ILT)因高度非凸目标函数易陷入局部最优解；现有生成式AI方法多为确定性图像转换，仅能模仿次优数据集，无法有效引导优化逃离非凸陷阱。

Method: 1. 将掩模合成重构为条件采样问题：生成器学习以设计图为条件的掩模分布，生成多候选解
2. 预训练：采用WGAN+重建损失
3. 微调：使用ILT引导的模仿损失进行组相对策略优化(GRPO)
4. 推理：采样小批量掩模→快速批处理ILT精修→评估光刻指标(EPE/工艺窗口)→选择最优解

Result: 1. LithoBench数据集：3nm容差下EPE违规减少，较强数值ILT基线吞吐量提升约2倍，掩模质量提高
2. ICCAD13竞赛案例：EPE改善超20%，较先进数值ILT求解器加速3倍

Conclusion: 通过学习生成ILT友好的初始化方案，该混合框架有效缓解非凸性问题，性能超越传统求解器或纯生成式AI方法。

Abstract: Inverse lithography (ILT) is critical for modern semiconductor manufacturing but suffers from highly non-convex objectives that often trap optimization in poor local minima. Generative AI has been explored to warm-start ILT, yet most approaches train deterministic image-to-image translators to mimic sub-optimal datasets, providing limited guidance for escaping non-convex traps during refinement. We reformulate mask synthesis as conditional sampling: a generator learns a distribution over masks conditioned on the design and proposes multiple candidates. The generator is first pretrained with WGAN plus a reconstruction loss, then fine-tuned using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an ILT-guided imitation loss. At inference, we sample a small batch of masks, run fast batched ILT refinement, evaluate lithography metrics (e.g., EPE, process window), and select the best candidate. On \texttt{LithoBench} dataset, the proposed hybrid framework reduces EPE violations under a 3\,nm tolerance and roughly doubles throughput versus a strong numerical ILT baseline, while improving final mask quality. We also present over 20\% EPE improvement on \texttt{ICCAD13} contest cases with 3$\times$ speedup over the SOTA numerical ILT solver. By learning to propose ILT-friendly initializations, our approach mitigates non-convexity and advances beyond what traditional solvers or GenAI can achieve.

Motivation: AI生成数据污染训练集形成反馈循环，导致模型崩溃，但其退化机制尚不明确。

Method: 将迭代反馈建模为马尔可夫链，识别产生神经共振的条件（遍历性和方向性收缩），并在扩散模型、CycleGAN和音频实验中验证。

Result: 发现神经共振现象，绘制流形几何演化图谱，提出八种崩溃行为分类法。

Conclusion: 神经共振为生成模型的长期退化行为提供了统一解释，并可用于识别、表征和缓解模型崩溃。

Abstract: AI training datasets will inevitably contain AI-generated examples, leading to ``feedback'' in which the output of one model impacts the training of another. It is known that such iterative feedback can lead to model collapse, yet the mechanisms underlying this degeneration remain poorly understood. Here we show that a broad class of feedback processes converges to a low-dimensional invariant structure in latent space, a phenomenon we call neural resonance. By modeling iterative feedback as a Markov Chain, we show that two conditions are needed for this resonance to occur: ergodicity of the feedback process and directional contraction of the latent representation. By studying diffusion models on MNIST and ImageNet, as well as CycleGAN and an audio feedback experiment, we map how local and global manifold geometry evolve, and we introduce an eight-pattern taxonomy of collapse behaviors. Neural resonance provides a unified explanation for long-term degenerate behavior in generative models and provides practical diagnostics for identifying, characterizing, and eventually mitigating collapse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏好微调(PFT)中的一个反复出现的挑战是处理非传递性（循环性）偏好。这种偏好源于（i）单目标排序不一致或（ii）将多目标标量化为单一指标。无论来源如何，其下游影响相同：不存在定义良好的最优策略，这打破了标准PFT流程的核心假设。

Method: 作者提出了一种新颖的博弈论解概念——最大熵布莱克利胜者（MaxEntBW），该概念在多目标非传递性偏好下具有良好定义。为实现大规模计算MaxEntBW，他们推导出PROSPER算法：一种可证明高效的PFT算法。与之前的自我博弈技术不同，PROSPER直接处理多目标而不需要标量化。

Result: 他们将PROSPER应用于从多目标LLM-as-a-Judge反馈（如基于评分标准的评判）中微调大型语言模型的问题，该场景中两种非传递性来源都会出现。研究发现，PROSPER在指令遵循和通用聊天基准测试上均优于所有考虑的基线模型，并发布了7B和3B参数规模的训练模型检查点。

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了偏好微调中的非传递性偏好问题，提出的MaxEntBW理论框架和PROSPER算法为处理多目标偏好提供了一种有效方法，在实践应用中展现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: A recurring challenge in preference fine-tuning (PFT) is handling $\textit{intransitive}$ (i.e., cyclic) preferences. Intransitive preferences often stem from either $\textit{(i)}$ inconsistent rankings along a single objective or $\textit{(ii)}$ scalarizing multiple objectives into a single metric. Regardless of their source, the downstream implication of intransitive preferences is the same: there is no well-defined optimal policy, breaking a core assumption of the standard PFT pipeline. In response, we propose a novel, game-theoretic solution concept -- the $\textit{Maximum Entropy Blackwell Winner}$ ($\textit{MaxEntBW}$) -- that is well-defined under multi-objective intransitive preferences. To enable computing MaxEntBWs at scale, we derive $\texttt{PROSPER}$: a provably efficient PFT algorithm. Unlike prior self-play techniques, $\texttt{PROSPER}$ directly handles multiple objectives without requiring scalarization. We then apply $\texttt{PROSPER}$ to the problem of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) from multi-objective LLM-as-a-Judge feedback (e.g., rubric-based judges), a setting where both sources of intransitivity arise. We find that $\texttt{PROSPER}$ outperforms all baselines considered across both instruction following and general chat benchmarks, releasing trained model checkpoints at the 7B and 3B parameter scales.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved strong results in text generation. However, their multi-step sampling leads to slow inference, limiting practical use. To address this, we extend Inverse Distillation, a technique originally developed to accelerate continuous diffusion models, to the discrete setting. Nonetheless, this extension introduces both theoretical and practical challenges. From a theoretical perspective, the inverse distillation objective lacks uniqueness guarantees, which may lead to suboptimal solutions. From a practical standpoint, backpropagation in the discrete space is non-trivial and often unstable. To overcome these challenges, we first provide a theoretical result demonstrating that our inverse formulation admits a unique solution, thereby ensuring valid optimization. We then introduce gradient-stable relaxations to support effective training. As a result, experiments on multiple DLMs show that our method, Inverse-distilled Diffusion Language Models (IDLM), reduces the number of inference steps by 4x-64x, while preserving the teacher model's entropy and generative perplexity.

### [56] [TimeRadar: A Domain-Rotatable Foundation Model for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19068)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeRadar: A novel time series foundation model that operates in a learnable fractional time-frequency domain to enable effective anomaly detection across diverse unseen datasets by adaptively separating abnormal patterns from normal ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series foundation models (TSFMs) focus on learning regular patterns for supervised tasks like forecasting, making them ineffective for unsupervised time series anomaly detection (TSAD) where abnormal patterns can resemble regular patterns in the same time/frequency domain.

Method: TimeRadar introduces two key components: (1) FTFRecon - uses learnable fractional order to rotate time series to optimal time-frequency angles for pronounced separation between normal and abnormal signals; (2) CDL - models local deviations relative to contextual time series data to capture fine-grained abnormalities.

Result: The model achieves adaptive reconstruction in optimal time-frequency domains per input, effectively differentiating unbounded abnormal patterns from regular ones across both training and unseen datasets without retraining.

Conclusion: By building foundation models in fractional time-frequency space with context-aware deviation learning, TimeRadar establishes a new paradigm for generalist time series anomaly detection that overcomes domain-specific limitations of conventional TSFMs.

Abstract: Current time series foundation models (TSFMs) primarily focus on learning prevalent and regular patterns within a predefined time or frequency domain to enable supervised downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting). Consequently, they are often ineffective for inherently unsupervised downstream tasks-such as time series anomaly detection (TSAD), which aims to identify rare, irregular patterns. This limitation arises because such abnormal patterns can closely resemble the regular patterns when presented in the same time/frequency domain. To address this issue, we introduce TimeRadar, an innovative TSFM built in a fractional time-frequency domain to support generalist TSAD across diverse unseen datasets. Our key insight is that rotating a time series into a data-dependent fractional time-frequency representation can adaptively differentiate the normal and abnormal signals across different datasets. To this end, a novel component, namely Fractionally modulated Time-Frequency Reconstruction (FTFRecon), is proposed in TimeRadar to leverage a learnable fractional order to rotate the time series to the most pronounced angle between a continuous time and frequency domain for accurate data reconstruction. This provides adaptive data reconstruction in an optimal time-frequency domain for each data input, enabling effective differentiation of the unbounded abnormal patterns from the regular ones across datasets, including unseen datasets. To allow TimeRadar to model local abnormality that is not captured by the global data reconstruction, we further introduce a Contextual Deviation Learning (CDL) component to model the local deviation of the input relative to its contextual time series data in the rotatable domain.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is fundamental to intelligent systems in transportation, climate science, and urban planning. However, training deep learning models on the massive, often redundant, datasets from these domains presents a significant computational bottleneck. Existing solutions typically focus on optimizing model architectures or optimizers, while overlooking the inherent inefficiency of the training data itself. This conventional approach of iterating over the entire static dataset each epoch wastes considerable resources on easy-to-learn or repetitive samples. In this paper, we explore a novel training-efficiency techniques, namely learning from complexity with dynamic sample pruning, ST-Prune, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through dynamic sample pruning, we aim to intelligently identify the most informative samples based on the model's real-time learning state, thereby accelerating convergence and improving training efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-Prune significantly accelerates the training speed while maintaining or even improving the model performance, and it also has scalability and universality.

TL;DR: 提出一种鲁棒贝叶斯随机特征回归方法，通过Huber污染集处理先验和似然误设，推导出可计算的后验预测边界，并保持经典双下降相结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯随机特征模型对先验和似然假设敏感，当模型存在误设时缺乏鲁棒性保证，需要建立能显式处理不确定性的预测框架。

Method: 采用ε-和η-污染 credal 集替代单一先验和似然，通过悲观广义贝叶斯更新进行推理，推导出后验预测密度的显式上下界。

Result: 1) 获得可处理的预测密度边界，显示模型模糊性等价于后验预测的直接污染；2) 提出不精确最高密度区域(IHDR)并给出高斯可信区间的外近似；3) 证明预测方差边界保持随机特征模型的经典渐近特性。

Conclusion: 建立了贝叶斯随机特征的鲁棒性理论：在计算可处理前提下，预测不确定性既继承双下降相位结构，又获得显式最坏情况保证，有效平衡了鲁棒性与计算效率。

Abstract: We propose a robust Bayesian formulation of random feature (RF) regression that accounts explicitly for prior and likelihood misspecification via Huber-style contamination sets. Starting from the classical equivalence between ridge-regularized RF training and Bayesian inference with Gaussian priors and likelihoods, we replace the single prior and likelihood with $ε$- and $η$-contaminated credal sets, respectively, and perform inference using pessimistic generalized Bayesian updating. We derive explicit and tractable bounds for the resulting lower and upper posterior predictive densities. These bounds show that, when contamination is moderate, prior and likelihood ambiguity effectively acts as a direct contamination of the posterior predictive distribution, yielding uncertainty envelopes around the classical Gaussian predictive. We introduce an Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) for robust predictive uncertainty quantification and show that it admits an efficient outer approximation via an adjusted Gaussian credible interval. We further obtain predictive variance bounds (under a mild truncation approximation for the upper bound) and prove that they preserve the leading-order proportional-growth asymptotics known for RF models. Together, these results establish a robustness theory for Bayesian random features: predictive uncertainty remains computationally tractable, inherits the classical double-descent phase structure, and is improved by explicit worst-case guarantees under bounded prior and likelihood misspecification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性约束假设训练标签反映真实分布，但标签偏差会导致不同子群标注错误率不均，使公平约束失效；关键挑战在于如何检测这种标签偏差

Method: 采用影响函数估计训练样本对模型预测的影响程度（基于损失函数的梯度和Hessian矩阵），构建样本评估流程：在MNIST上引入20%标签翻转的受控错误，在CheXpert医学影像数据集测试，使用对角Hessian近似提高计算效率

Result: 在MNIST上成功检测近90%的错误标注样本；CheXpert中错误标注样本持续呈现更高影响分数，证明影响函数识别标签错误的可行性

Conclusion: 影响函数为检测标签偏差提供了新途径，能有效识别错误标注样本，尤其在医疗影像等复杂场景具有应用潜力，但需注意Hessian近似的计算效率与精度平衡

Abstract: Labeling bias arises during data collection due to resource limitations or unconscious bias, leading to unequal label error rates across subgroups or misrepresentation of subgroup prevalence. Most fairness constraints assume training labels reflect the true distribution, rendering them ineffective when labeling bias is present; leaving a challenging question, that \textit{how can we detect such labeling bias?} In this work, we investigate whether influence functions can be used to detect labeling bias. Influence functions estimate how much each training sample affects a model's predictions by leveraging the gradient and Hessian of the loss function -- when labeling errors occur, influence functions can identify wrongly labeled samples in the training set, revealing the underlying failure mode. We develop a sample valuation pipeline and test it first on the MNIST dataset, then scaled to the more complex CheXpert medical imaging dataset. To examine label noise, we introduced controlled errors by flipping 20\% of the labels for one class in the dataset. Using a diagonal Hessian approximation, we demonstrated promising results, successfully detecting nearly 90\% of mislabeled samples in MNIST. On CheXpert, mislabeled samples consistently exhibit higher influence scores. These results highlight the potential of influence functions for identifying label errors.

Abstract: Supervised causal learning has shown promise in causal discovery, yet it often struggles with generalization across diverse interventional settings, particularly when intervention targets are unknown. To address this, we propose TICL (Test-time Interventional Causal Learning), a novel method that synergizes Test-Time Training with Joint Causal Inference. Specifically, we design a self-augmentation strategy to generate instance-specific training data at test time, effectively avoiding distribution shifts. Furthermore, by integrating joint causal inference, we developed a PC-inspired two-phase supervised learning scheme, which effectively leverages self-augmented training data while ensuring theoretical identifiability. Extensive experiments on bnlearn benchmarks demonstrate TICL's superiority in multiple aspects of causal discovery and intervention target detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可学习优化器存在两大瓶颈：元训练成本极高（如VeLO需4000 TPU月）且泛化能力差（仅支持6亿参数任务），限制了实际应用。

Method: 设计简单的归一化优化器架构并增强元训练策略，大幅降低训练成本。

Result: 在4.5 GPU小时内完成训练；优化器稳定扩展至13亿参数预训练任务（比训练分布大六个数量级）；在分布外任务上表现优异；兼容现代优化技术。

Conclusion: 为实用可学习优化器铺平道路，开启了更丰富元训练和数据策展的探索空间，有望进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Learned optimizers are powerful alternatives to hand-designed update rules like Adam, yet they have seen limited practical adoption since they often fail to meta-generalize beyond their training distribution and incur high meta-training cost. For instance, prior work, VeLO, scaled meta-training to 4,000 TPU months ($\sim$10$\times$ GPT-3 compute) to meta-train a general-purpose optimizer but it failed to generalize beyond 600M parameters tasks. In this work, we present a surprising finding: by crafting a simple normalized optimizer architecture and augmenting meta-training, it becomes feasible to meta-train a performant general-purpose learned update rule on a tiny fraction of VeLO compute, 4.5 GPU hours to be precise. Our learned update rule scales stably to a billion-scale pretraining task (GPT-3 XL 1.3B) which is six orders of magnitude larger than its meta-training distribution. Furthermore, it shows strong performance across diverse out-of-distribution tasks and is compatible with modern optimization harness that includes orthogonalization, distinct update rules for input-output and hidden weights, and decoupled weight decay. In all, this work paves the way for practically applicable learnable optimization algorithms, unlocking exploration of richer meta-training and data curation recipes to further improve performance.

Method: 引入高阶马尔可夫链任务，通过稀疏注意力模式分析学习动态，使用简化微分方程建模轨迹并证明阶段收敛性。

Result: 发现Transformer增量式学习：各阶段通过稀疏注意力获取特定信息；学习动力从竞争性（头部收敛于最显著模式）转变为协作性（头部专精不同模式）；模型通过更简单的误设假设类逐步升级到完整模型类；早停作为隐式正则器使模型偏向简单类。

Conclusion: 为Transformer中阶段性学习和复杂行为涌现提供了理论基础，对自然语言处理和算法推理的泛化机制有重要启示。

Abstract: This paper introduces a high-order Markov chain task to investigate how transformers learn to integrate information from multiple past positions with varying statistical significance. We demonstrate that transformers learn this task incrementally: each stage is defined by the acquisition of specific information through sparse attention patterns. Notably, we identify a shift in learning dynamics from competitive, where heads converge on the most statistically dominant pattern, to cooperative, where heads specialize in distinct patterns. We model these dynamics using simplified differential equations that characterize the trajectory and prove stage-wise convergence results. Our analysis reveals that transformers ascend a complexity ladder by passing through simpler, misspecified hypothesis classes before reaching the full model class. We further show that early stopping acts as an implicit regularizer, biasing the model toward these simpler classes. These results provide a theoretical foundation for the emergence of staged learning and complex behaviors in transformers, offering insights into generalization for natural language processing and algorithmic reasoning.

Motivation: 与LoRA等静态参数高效微调方法不同，现有方法缺乏动态适应性。需要一种无需持久参数更新的测试时自适应技术来增强大语言模型的推理能力。

Method: VPS通过ΔW = gamma * W^T V U^T W的形式，利用批次激活统计和稀疏选择或Sylvester回归动态构建选择矩阵U和V，对冻结的Transformer线性层进行低秩扰动，并基于激活能量和token熵自适应调节扰动强度。

Conclusion: VPS实现了无需参数更新的有效测试时自适应，激活条件计算是提升大语言模型推理能力的有前途的方法。

Abstract: I introduce Virtual Parameter Sharpening (VPS), an inference-time technique that augments frozen transformer linear layers with dynamic, activation-conditioned low-rank perturbations. Unlike parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA, which learn static low-rank adapters, VPS constructs its perturbation factors on the fly from batch activation statistics and optional gradient signals, enabling test-time adaptation without persistent parameter updates. The perturbation takes the form Delta W = gamma * W^T V U^T W, where selector matrices U and V are constructed via sparse activation-guided selection or Sylvester-coupled regression. We provide a theoretical analysis of the perturbation's spectral properties and describe an adaptive policy system that modulates perturbation magnitude based on activation energy and token-level entropy. This system incorporates multi-objective verification with iterative refinement for tasks with ground-truth supervision. We present the complete algorithmic framework, analyze its mathematical foundations, and discuss the mechanisms by which activation-conditioned computation may enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models.

Motivation: 标准联邦学习仅处理横向或纵向数据划分，而许多现实场景呈现复杂的混合分布。本文以金融犯罪检测为例，交易方持有交易级属性，多家银行持有账户级特征，需要保护数据隐私的同时进行联合建模。

Method: 提出混合联邦学习 (HybridFL)，通过整合横向聚合和纵向特征融合，在保持数据本地化的前提下实现联合学习。

Conclusion: HybridFL 为混合数据划分的场景提供了一种有效解决方案，能够在严格保护数据隐私的同时实现高性能的联合建模。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models on privately owned data without sharing raw information. While standard FL typically addresses either horizontal or vertical data partitions, many real-world scenarios exhibit a complex hybrid distribution. This paper proposes Hybrid Federated Learning (HybridFL) to address data split both horizontally across disjoint users and vertically across complementary feature sets. We evaluate HybridFL in a financial crime detection context, where a transaction party holds transaction-level attributes and multiple banks maintain private account-level features. By integrating horizontal aggregation and vertical feature fusion, the proposed architecture enables joint learning while strictly preserving data locality. Experiments on AMLSim and SWIFT datasets demonstrate that HybridFL significantly outperforms the transaction-only local model and achieves performance comparable to a centralized benchmark.

*Amit Lal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First independent evaluation of SAP's RPT-1 tabular foundation model shows it achieves 91-96% of tuned GBDT accuracy without task-specific training, with a crossover advantage in low-data regimes (<100 rows), enabling a hybrid workflow for enterprise ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular foundation models promise to democratize ML for enterprise data, but lack independent practitioner evaluation; this paper assesses SAP's RPT-1 against traditional GBDT methods to guide real-world adoption decisions.

Method: Benchmarked RPT-1 (64.6 MB, pretrained on 1.34 TB structured data) against tuned XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost on three SAP business scenarios (demand forecasting, data integrity, financial risk) using five-fold cross-validation across datasets of 2,500-3,200 rows with zero-shot evaluation.

Result: RPT-1 reaches 91-96% of tuned GBDT accuracy; classification gaps are modest (3.6-4.1 pp AUC-ROC) while regression gaps are larger (8.9-11.1 pp R-squared). Key finding: RPT-1 outperforms XGBoost under limited data (75-100 context rows).

Conclusion: Proposes a hybrid workflow: use RPT-1 for rapid screening and initial predictions, then selectively train GBDT models only where accuracy gains justify the effort, balancing efficiency and performance for enterprise applications.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models aim to make machine learning accessible for enterprise data without task-specific training. This paper presents the first independent evaluation of SAP's Retrieval Pretrained Transformer (RPT-1) from a practitioner perspective. RPT-1 is a compact 64.6 MB model pretrained on 1.34 TB of structured data across 3.1 million tables. We benchmark it against tuned gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on three SAP business scenarios: demand forecasting across SD/MM/PP modules, predictive data integrity in BC/MM/QM, and financial risk classification in FI/CO/AR. Across five-fold cross-validation on datasets ranging from 2,500 to 3,200 rows, RPT-1 reaches 91-96% of tuned GBDT accuracy without any training examples. The classification gap is modest at 3.6-4.1 percentage points on AUC-ROC, though regression tasks show wider gaps of 8.9-11.1 percentage points on R-squared. An interesting finding is a crossover at roughly 75-100 context rows where RPT-1 actually outperforms XGBoost under limited data. Based on these results, we propose a practical hybrid workflow: use RPT-1 for rapid screening, then train GBDT selectively where prediction accuracy justifies the effort. All experiments are reproducible through publicly available Hugging Face Spaces.

Abstract: Fuzzy systems show strong potential in explainable AI due to their rule-based architecture and linguistic variables. Existing approaches navigate the accuracy-explainability trade-off either through evolutionary multi-objective optimization (MOO), which is computationally expensive, or gradient-based scalarization, which cannot recover non-convex Pareto regions. We propose X-ANFIS, an alternating bi-objective gradient-based optimization scheme for explainable adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems. Cauchy membership functions are used for stable training under semantically controlled initializations, and a differentiable explainability objective is introduced and decoupled from the performance objective through alternating gradient passes. Validated in approximately 5,000 experiments on nine UCI regression datasets, X-ANFIS consistently achieves target distinguishability while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy, recovering solutions beyond the convex hull of the MOO Pareto front.

Motivation: 现有图扩散方法针对无向结构设计，会丢弃神经架构这类有向无环图中边方向所编码的数据流等功能语义信息，这在神经架构搜索（NAS）中是一个重要缺陷。

Method: 提出有向图策略优化（DGPO），通过引入拓扑节点排序和位置编码，将强化学习微调扩展到有向无环图（DAG）的离散图扩散模型。

Result: 在NAS-Bench-101和NAS-Bench-201上验证，DGPO在所有三个NAS-Bench-201任务上达到基准最优（91.61%、73.49%、46.77%）。关键发现是模型学习到可迁移的结构先验：仅用7%搜索空间预训练，微调后生成接近最优的架构，性能与全数据模型仅差0.32个百分点，且能超越训练上限7.3个百分点。双向控制实验证实奖励驱动的 steering 能力，逆向优化准确率接近随机（9.5%）。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，一旦扩展以处理方向性，强化学习调控的离散扩散可为有向组合结构提供可控的生成框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning has proven effective for steering generative diffusion models toward desired properties in image and molecular domains. Graph diffusion models have similarly been applied to combinatorial structure generation, including neural architecture search (NAS). However, neural architectures are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where edge direction encodes functional semantics such as data flow-information that existing graph diffusion methods, designed for undirected structures, discard. We propose Directed Graph Policy Optimization (DGPO), which extends reinforcement learning fine-tuning of discrete graph diffusion models to DAGs via topological node ordering and positional encoding. Validated on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, DGPO matches the benchmark optimum on all three NAS-Bench-201 tasks (91.61%, 73.49%, 46.77%). The central finding is that the model learns transferable structural priors: pretrained on only 7% of the search space, it generates near-oracle architectures after fine-tuning, within 0.32 percentage points of the full-data model and extrapolating 7.3 percentage points beyond its training ceiling. Bidirectional control experiments confirm genuine reward-driven steering, with inverse optimization reaching near random-chance accuracy (9.5%). These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning-steered discrete diffusion, once extended to handle directionality, provides a controllable generative framework for directed combinatorial structures.

TL;DR: 本文指出联邦学习中非独立同分布数据导致二阶优化器不稳定的关键在于预条件器漂移，并提出FedPAC框架通过预条件器对齐与校正实现可靠的联邦二阶优化，在保证线性加速的同时提升稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二阶优化器能显著加速大规模训练，但在联邦学习的非独立同分布数据场景下，其联邦变体往往不稳定甚至发散，根源在于客户端二阶训练诱导的异质性曲率定义几何结构与服务器端模型平均的不兼容度量。

Method: 提出FedPAC（预条件器对齐与校正）框架，将参数聚合与几何同步解耦：(i) 对齐：聚合本地预条件器形成全局参考并预热启动客户端；(ii) 校正：利用全局预条件器方向引导本地预条件器更新以抑制长期漂移。

Result: 提供漂移耦合的非凸收敛保证及参与方部分参与下的线性加速；在视觉和语言任务上显著提升稳定性和准确性，在CIFAR-100的ViT模型上实现高达5.8%的绝对精度提升。

Conclusion: FedPAC通过预条件器对齐与校正解决几何失配问题，为联邦二阶优化提供可靠保障，兼具理论保证与实证性能提升。

Abstract: Second-order optimizers can significantly accelerate large-scale training, yet their naive federated variants are often unstable or even diverge on non-IID data.
  We show that a key culprit is \emph{preconditioner drift}: client-side second-order training induces heterogeneous \emph{curvature-defined geometries} (i.e., preconditioner coordinate systems), and server-side model averaging updates computed under incompatible metrics, corrupting the global descent direction.
  To address this geometric mismatch, we propose \texttt{FedPAC}, a \emph{preconditioner alignment and correction} framework for reliable federated second-order optimization.
  \texttt{FedPAC} explicitly decouples parameter aggregation from geometry synchronization by:
  (i) \textbf{Alignment} (i.e.,aggregating local preconditioners into a global reference and warm-starting clients via global preconditioner); and

### [69] [Soft Sequence Policy Optimization: Bridging GMPO and SAPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19327)
*Svetlana Glazyrina,Maksim Kryzhanovskiy,Roman Ischenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Soft Sequence Policy Optimization (SSPO), a new GRPO-based method that uses soft gating over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights to improve exploration and stability in LLM alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current GRPO-based LLM alignment methods, particularly PPO-style clipping that causes training signal loss and entropy collapse, while better aligning with sequence-level rewards used in many tasks.

Method: Soft Sequence Policy Optimization (SSPO), an off-policy reinforcement learning objective that incorporates soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights.

Result: The abstract indicates the method promotes effective policy exploration while maintaining training stability, though specific experimental results are not provided in this excerpt.

Conclusion: The proposed SSPO successfully builds upon SAPO and GMPO by combining sequence-level importance sampling with soft gating to achieve both stable training and effective exploration for LLM alignment.

Abstract: A significant portion of recent research on Large Language Model (LLM) alignment focuses on developing new policy optimization methods based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Two prominent directions have emerged: (i) a shift toward sequence-level importance sampling weights that better align with the sequence-level rewards used in many tasks, and (ii) alternatives to PPO-style clipping that aim to avoid the associated loss of training signal and entropy collapse. Recent work, such as Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), reformulates the Scopic objective within the GRPO framework and achieves both sequence coherence and token adaptivity. Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO) leverages token-wise ratio clipping within sequence importance sampling weights. Building on these ideas, this work proposes a new objective that promotes effective policy exploration while maintaining training stability. Specifically, we introduce Soft Sequence Policy Optimization, an off-policy reinforcement learning objective that incorporates soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights.

TL;DR: 提出CTS-Bench基准测试套件，用于评估图粗化在GNN-based时钟树综合分析中的准确性与效率权衡，揭示通用聚类技术会损害关键学习目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在电子设计自动化时钟树综合(CTS)分析中应用受限，因原始门级网表内存和运行时开销过高；现有图粗化方法虽提升可扩展性，但对其在CTS关键学习任务影响缺乏系统研究。

Method: 开发CTS-Bench基准套件，包含5种架构的4860个收敛物理设计方案及配对的原始/聚类图表示；以时钟偏移预测为任务，量化评估图粗化对GPU内存、训练速度与预测精度的影响。

Result: 图粗化使GPU内存降低17.2倍、训练加速3倍，但因移除时钟分布关键结构信息，零样本评估下R²分数常为负值，通用聚类技术显著损害CTS学习目标。

Conclusion: CTS-Bench为CTS感知图粗化策略提供评估框架，支持真实物理设计约束下的GNN架构与加速器基准测试，助力开发学习型CTS分析与优化技术。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly explored for physical design analysis in Electronic Design Automation, particularly for modeling Clock Tree Synthesis behavior such as clock skew and buffering complexity. However, practical deployment remains limited due to the prohibitive memory and runtime cost of operating on raw gate-level netlists. Graph coarsening is commonly used to improve scalability, yet its impact on CTS-critical learning objectives is not well characterized. This paper introduces CTS-Bench, a benchmark suite for systematically evaluating the trade-offs between graph coarsening, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency in GNN-based CTS analysis. CTS-Bench consists of 4,860 converged physical design solutions spanning five architectures and provides paired raw gate-level and clustered graph representations derived from post-placement designs. Using clock skew prediction as a representative CTS task, we demonstrate a clear accuracy-efficiency trade-off. While graph coarsening reduces GPU memory usage by up to 17.2x and accelerates training by up to 3x, it also removes structural information essential for modeling clock distribution, frequently resulting in negative $R^2$ scores under zero-shot evaluation. Our findings indicate that generic graph clustering techniques can fundamentally compromise CTS learning objectives, even when global physical metrics remain unchanged. CTS-Bench enables principled evaluation of CTS-aware graph coarsening strategies, supports benchmarking of GNN architectures and accelerators under realistic physical design constraints, and provides a foundation for developing learning-assisted CTS analysis and optimization techniques.

Motivation: 现有模型合并方法局限于同质架构，而GNN的消息传递机制对拓扑依赖和错位敏感，直接参数空间合并不可靠，需要解决异构GNN的跨架构合并问题

Method: 提出训练无关的H-GRAMA框架，将合并从参数空间提升到算子空间；形式化定义通用消息传递混合体(UMPM)作为共享算子族，用共同函数语言表达异构GNN层

Conclusion: 该框架突破了GNN模型合并的架构限制，为异构专家模型融合提供了新范式，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a powerful paradigm for combining the capabilities of distinct expert models without the high computational cost of retraining, yet current methods are fundamentally constrained to homogeneous architectures. For GNNs, however, message passing is topology-dependent and sensitive to misalignment, making direct parameter-space merging unreliable. To bridge this gap, we introduce H-GRAMA (Heterogeneous Graph Routing and Message Alignment), a training-free framework that lifts merging from parameter space to operator space. We formalize Universal Message Passing Mixture (UMPM), a shared operator family that expresses heterogeneous GNN layers in a common functional language. H-GRAMA enables cross-architecture GNN merging (e.g., GCN to GAT) without retraining, retaining high specialist accuracy in most cases in compatible depth settings and achieving inference speedups of 1.2x to 1.9x over ensembles.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the training of large language models and enhanced their reasoning capabilities, while it remains susceptible to instability due to the use of hard clipping. Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO) addresses this limitation by replacing clipping with a smooth sigmoid-based gate function, which leads to more stable updates. We have decided to push this theory further and investigate the impact of different gate functions on both training stability and final model performance. We formalize the key properties that admissible gates should satisfy and identify several families of such functions for empirical evaluation. This paper presents an analysis of our findings based on experiments conducted with the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model on mathematical reasoning tasks. These results provide practical guidance for designing smoother and more robust policy optimization objectives for large language model training.

Conclusion: 该架构为平衡快速学习和泛化能力提供了新路径，支持稳健的持续学习系统发展。

Abstract: Generalization is often regarded as an essential property of machine learning systems. However, perhaps not every component of a system needs to generalize. Training models for generalization typically produces entangled representations at the boundaries of entities or classes, which can lead to destructive interference when rapid, high-magnitude updates are required for continual or few-shot learning. Techniques for fast learning with non-interfering representations exist, but they generally fail to generalize. Here, we describe a Complementary Learning System (CLS) in which the fast learner entirely foregoes generalization in exchange for continual zero-shot and few-shot learning. Unlike most CLS approaches, which use episodic memory primarily for replay and consolidation, our fast, disentangled learner operates as a parallel reasoning system. The fast learner can overcome observation variability and uncertainty by leveraging a conventional slow, statistical learner within an active perception system: A contextual bias provided by the fast learner induces the slow learner to encode novel stimuli in familiar, generalized terms, enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning. This architecture demonstrates that fast, context-driven reasoning can coexist with slow, structured generalization, providing a pathway for robust continual learning.

### [74] [LLMs Can Learn to Reason Via Off-Policy RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19362)
*Daniel Ritter,Owen Oertell,Bradley Guo,Jonathan Chang,Kianté Brantley,Wen Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OAPL is a novel off-policy RL algorithm for LLMs that embraces policy lag instead of correcting for it, achieving better performance with fewer generations and handling much larger policy lags than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL algorithms for LLMs (PPO, GRPO) assume on-policy data, but distributed training creates policy lag between training and inference policies, making data off-policy. Prior work tries to fix this by making off-policy data appear on-policy via importance sampling or inference engine modifications.

Method: Propose OAPL (Optimal Advantage-based Policy Optimization with Lagged Inference policy), a novel off-policy RL algorithm that directly handles off-policyness without needing importance sampling or inference engine modifications.

Result: OAPL outperforms GRPO with IS on math benchmarks, matches DeepCoder on LiveCodeBench using 3x fewer generations, shows improved Pass@k scaling, and works with >400-step lags (100x more off-policy than prior methods).

Conclusion: OAPL demonstrates that embracing off-policyness is more effective than correcting for it, enabling efficient and effective post-training of LLMs even with large policy lags.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently use on-policy algorithms, such as PPO or GRPO. However, policy lag from distributed training architectures and differences between the training and inference policies break this assumption, making the data off-policy by design. To rectify this, prior work has focused on making this off-policy data appear more on-policy, either via importance sampling (IS), or by more closely aligning the training and inference policies by explicitly modifying the inference engine. In this work, we embrace off-policyness and propose a novel off-policy RL algorithm that does not require these modifications: Optimal Advantage-based Policy Optimization with Lagged Inference policy (OAPL). We show that OAPL outperforms GRPO with importance sampling on competition math benchmarks, and can match the performance of a publicly available coding model, DeepCoder, on LiveCodeBench, while using 3x fewer generations during training. We further empirically demonstrate that models trained via OAPL have improved test time scaling under the Pass@k metric. OAPL allows for efficient, effective post-training even with lags of more than 400 gradient steps between the training and inference policies, 100x more off-policy than prior approaches.

Result: 在多领域实证表明，该方法计算成本低廉，能有效提升非平稳环境下的性能，同时减少表征崩溃、神经元休眠和训练不稳定性。

Conclusion: 各向同性高斯正则化是改善深度强化学习在非平稳环境下训练稳定性和适应性的简单有效方案。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning systems often suffer from unstable training dynamics due to non-stationarity, where learning objectives and data distributions evolve over time. We show that under non-stationary targets, isotropic Gaussian embeddings are provably advantageous. In particular, they induce stable tracking of time-varying targets for linear readouts, achieve maximal entropy under a fixed variance budget, and encourage a balanced use of all representational dimensions--all of which enable agents to be more adaptive and stable. Building on this insight, we propose the use of Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization for shaping representations toward an isotropic Gaussian distribution during training. We demonstrate empirically, over a variety of domains, that this simple and computationally inexpensive method improves performance under non-stationarity while reducing representation collapse, neuron dormancy, and training instability.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Steck, Ekanadham, and Kallus [arXiv:2403.05440] demonstrate that cosine similarity of learned embeddings from matrix factorization models can be rendered arbitrary by a diagonal ``gauge'' matrix $D$. Their result is correct and important for practitioners who compute cosine similarity on embeddings trained with dot-product objectives. However, we argue that their conclusion, cautioning against cosine similarity in general, conflates the pathology of an incompatible training objective with the geometric validity of cosine distance on the unit sphere. We prove that when embeddings are constrained to the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ (either during or after training with an appropriate objective), the $D$-matrix ambiguity vanishes identically, and cosine distance reduces to exactly half the squared Euclidean distance. This monotonic equivalence implies that cosine-based and Euclidean-based neighbor rankings are identical on normalized embeddings. The ``problem'' with cosine similarity is not cosine similarity, it is the failure to normalize.

*Phillip Si,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes LEVDA, an ensemble-based data assimilation method that uses neural network surrogates to improve geophysical forecasting accuracy and efficiency under sparse observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-range geophysical forecasts are limited by chaotic dynamics and numerical errors. Classical methods are computationally expensive, while newer latent filtering methods have limitations in trajectory constraints and observation grid assumptions.

Method: LEVDA performs 4D ensemble-variational optimization in the latent space of a pretrained differentiable neural dynamics surrogate, jointly assimilating states and parameters without adjoint models.

Result: LEVDA matches or outperforms latent filtering baselines under severe observational sparsity with better uncertainty quantification, while achieving higher accuracy and computational efficiency than full-state 4DEnVar.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the gap between classical and modern data assimilation approaches, offering improved performance and efficiency for geophysical forecasting.

Abstract: Long-range geophysical forecasts are fundamentally limited by chaotic dynamics and numerical errors. While data assimilation can mitigate these issues, classical variational smoothers require computationally expensive tangent-linear and adjoint models. Conversely, recent efficient latent filtering methods often enforce weak trajectory-level constraints and assume fixed observation grids. To bridge this gap, we propose Latent Ensemble Variational Data Assimilation (LEVDA), an ensemble-space variational smoother that operates in the low-dimensional latent space of a pretrained differentiable neural dynamics surrogate. By performing four-dimensional ensemble-variational (4DEnVar) optimization within an ensemble subspace, LEVDA jointly assimilates states and unknown parameters without the need for adjoint code or auxiliary observation-to-latent encoders. Leveraging the fully differentiable, continuous-in-time-and-space nature of the surrogate, LEVDA naturally accommodates highly irregular sampling at arbitrary spatiotemporal locations. Across three challenging geophysical benchmarks, LEVDA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art latent filtering baselines under severe observational sparsity while providing more reliable uncertainty quantification. Simultaneously, it achieves substantially improved assimilation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to full-state 4DEnVar.

*Nazal Mohamed,Ayush Mohanty,Nagi Gebraeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated causal representation learning framework for interdependent industrial control systems that enables privacy-preserving counterfactual reasoning by exchanging compact latent states instead of raw data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial asset networks are tightly coupled through physical processes, making it crucial to understand how one client's operations affect others, but raw data are high-dimensional, private, and cannot be centralized, while proprietary local models cannot be modified.

Method: Federated framework where clients map high-dimensional observations to low-dimensional latent states disentangling intrinsic dynamics from control influences; a central server estimates global structure enabling decentralized counterfactual predictions with only latent state exchanges, with convergence proofs and privacy guarantees.

Result: Experiments demonstrate scalability and accurate cross-client counterfactual inference on synthetic and real-world industrial control system datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables causal reasoning across interdependent industrial clients while preserving privacy and maintaining decentralized operations.

Abstract: Networks of interdependent industrial assets (clients) are tightly coupled through physical processes and control inputs, raising a key question: how would the output of one client change if another client were operated differently? This is difficult to answer because client-specific data are high-dimensional and private, making centralization of raw data infeasible. Each client also maintains proprietary local models that cannot be modified. We propose a federated framework for causal representation learning in state-space systems that captures interdependencies among clients under these constraints. Each client maps high-dimensional observations into low-dimensional latent states that disentangle intrinsic dynamics from control-driven influences. A central server estimates the global state-transition and control structure. This enables decentralized counterfactual reasoning where clients predict how outputs would change under alternative control inputs at others while only exchanging compact latent states. We prove convergence to a centralized oracle and provide privacy guarantees. Our experiments demonstrate scalability, and accurate cross-client counterfactual inference on synthetic and real-world industrial control system datasets.

Conclusion: "机制感知的惰性"策略能显著提升资本效率，通过减少不必要的再平衡操作，保留原本会被运营成本侵蚀的收益

Abstract: Concentrated liquidity provision in decentralized exchanges presents a fundamental Impulse Control problem. Liquidity Providers (LPs) face a non-trivial trade-off between maximizing fee accrual through tight price-range concentration and minimizing the friction costs of rebalancing, including gas fees and swap slippage. Existing methods typically employ heuristic or threshold strategies that fail to account for market dynamics. This paper formulates liquidity management as an optimal control problem and derives the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJB-QVI). We present an approximate solution RAmmStein, a Deep Reinforcement Learning method that incorporates the mean-reversion speed (theta) of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process among other features as input to the model. We demonstrate that the agent learns to separate the state space into regions of action and inaction. We evaluate the framework using high-frequency 1Hz Coinbase trade data comprising over 6.8M trades. Experimental results show that RAmmStein achieves a superior net ROI of 0.72% compared to both passive and aggressive strategies. Notably, the agent reduces rebalancing frequency by 67% compared to a greedy rebalancing strategy while maintaining 88% active time. Our results demonstrate that regime-aware laziness can significantly improve capital efficiency by preserving the returns that would otherwise be eroded by the operational costs.

Conclusion: 框架成功弥合通用推理与领域知识的鸿沟，为时间序列诊断推理提供高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Time-series diagnostic reasoning is essential for many applications, yet existing solutions face a persistent gap: general reasoning large language models (GRLMs) possess strong reasoning skills but lack the domain-specific knowledge to understand complex time-series patterns. Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in clinical predictions is critical for high-stakes diagnosis tasks. Conformal prediction offers a principled approach by providing prediction sets with theoretical coverage guarantees. However, in practice, patient distribution shifts violate the i.i.d. assumptions underlying standard conformal methods, leading to poor coverage in healthcare settings. In this work, we evaluate several conformal prediction approaches on EEG seizure classification, a task with known distribution shift challenges and label uncertainty. We demonstrate that personalized calibration strategies can improve coverage by over 20 percentage points while maintaining comparable prediction set sizes.

TL;DR: 针对深度共形分类器中softmax输出的不可靠性问题，本文提出一种基于亥姆霍兹自由能重新加权非conformity分数的新方法，显著提高了预测集合的适应性和效率，且无需引入额外后处理复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测作为无分布不确定性量化框架，其性能取决于生成高效且自适应的预测集合。然而，深度共形分类器依赖softmax输出计算非conformity分数，这可能导致过度自信的错误分类或不恰当的犹豫，限制了预测集合的适应性。

Method: 利用预softmax logit空间信息，采用亥姆霍兹自由能作为模型不确定性和样本难度的度量。通过对每个样本的能量分数进行单调变换并重新加权非conformity分数，提高其对输入难度的敏感性。

Result: 在多个数据集和深度架构上，使用四种先进分数函数的实验表明，这种基于能量的增强方法相比基线非conformity分数，显著提高了预测集合的适应性和效率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了softmax-based非conformity分数的局限性，为提升深度共形预测的性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: The merit of Conformal Prediction (CP), as a distribution-free framework for uncertainty quantification, depends on generating prediction sets that are efficient, reflected in small average set sizes, while adaptive, meaning they signal uncertainty by varying in size according to input difficulty. A central limitation for deep conformal classifiers is that the nonconformity scores are derived from softmax outputs, which can be unreliable indicators of how certain the model truly is about a given input, sometimes leading to overconfident misclassifications or undue hesitation. In this work, we argue that this unreliability can be inherited by the prediction sets generated by CP, limiting their capacity for adaptiveness. We propose a new approach that leverages information from the pre-softmax logit space, using the Helmholtz Free Energy as a measure of model uncertainty and sample difficulty. By reweighting nonconformity scores with a monotonic transformation of the energy score of each sample, we improve their sensitivity to input difficulty. Our experiments with four state-of-the-art score functions on multiple datasets and deep architectures show that this energy-based enhancement improves the adaptiveness of the prediction sets, leading to a notable increase in both efficiency and adaptiveness compared to baseline nonconformity scores, without introducing any post-hoc complexity.

TL;DR: 理论分析表明，数据混合需T按Θ(log N)（全梯度）或Θ(√(N log N))（随机梯度）缩放，且常用T=1的贪心策略会失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据混合对训练鲁棒机器学习模型至关重要，可形式化为双层优化问题。经典双层优化要求内层优化收敛，但实际方法因计算限制仅使用少量内层更新步数T，该近似的理论影响尚不明确。

Method: 严格分析有限内层步数T下数据混合的收敛行为。证明贪心策略T=1即使在简单二次例子中也会失败。在固定参数更新预算N且假设域损失强凸的条件下，推导全梯度和随机梯度下的最优T缩放规律。

Result: 贪心策略T=1在简单情况下也会失效。全梯度访问时最优T按Θ(log N)缩放，随机梯度时按Θ((N log N)^(1/2))缩放。

Conclusion: 该研究为数据混合提供了理论指导，揭示了实用贪心方法的局限性，并给出了不同梯度设置下的最优内层步数缩放规律。

Abstract: Data mixing--the strategic reweighting of training domains--is a critical component in training robust machine learning models. This problem is naturally formulated as a bilevel optimization task, where the outer loop optimizes domain weights to minimize validation loss, and the inner loop optimizes model parameters to minimize the weighted training loss. Classical bilevel optimization relies on hypergradients, which theoretically require the inner optimization to reach convergence. However, due to computational constraints, state-of-the-art methods use a finite, often small, number of inner update steps before updating the weights. The theoretical implications of this approximation are not well understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of data mixing with a finite number of inner steps $T$. We prove that the "greedy" practical approach of using $T=1$ can fail even in a simple quadratic example. Under a fixed parameter update budget $N$ and assuming the per-domain losses are strongly convex, we show that the optimal $T$ scales as $Θ(\log N)$ (resp., $Θ({(N \log N)}^{1/2})$) for the data mixing problem with access to full (resp., stochastic) gradients. We complement our theoretical results with proof-of-concept experiments.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spectral diagnostic framework based on Random Matrix Theory detects silent overfitting in crash classification models by analyzing eigenvalue spectra, where the power-law exponent α reliably distinguishes well-regularized from overfit models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like accuracy, F1, and AUC cannot reveal silent overfitting in crash classification models, which is critical for transportation safety applications where model reliability is essential.

Method: Unified spectral diagnostic framework using Random Matrix Theory and Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization to analyze eigenvalue spectra across diverse ML architectures (BERT, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN) on two large Iowa DOT crash datasets (173,512 and 371,062 records).

Result: The power-law exponent α provides a structural quality signal: well-regularized models yield α∈[2,4] (mean 2.87±0.34) while overfit models show α<2 or spectral collapse; strong correlation between α and expert agreement (Spearman ρ=0.89, p<0.001).

Conclusion: The framework enables reliable overfitting detection and model selection via α-based early stopping, validated against F1 baselines, with Sparse Lanczos approximations ensuring scalability for large transportation safety datasets.

Abstract: Crash classification models in transportation safety are typically evaluated using accuracy, F1, or AUC, metrics that cannot reveal whether a model is silently overfitting. We introduce a spectral diagnostic framework grounded in Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) that spans the ML taxonomy: weight matrices for BERT/ALBERT/Qwen2.5, out-of-fold increment matrices for XGBoost/Random Forest, empirical Hessians for Logistic Regression, induced affinity matrices for Decision Trees, and Graph Laplacians for KNN. Evaluating nine model families on two Iowa DOT crash classification tasks (173,512 and 371,062 records respectively), we find that the power-law exponent $α$ provides a structural quality signal: well-regularized models consistently yield $α$ within $[2, 4]$ (mean $2.87 \pm 0.34$), while overfit variants show $α< 2$ or spectral collapse. We observe a strong rank correlation between $α$ and expert agreement (Spearman $ρ= 0.89$, $p < 0.001$), suggesting spectral quality captures model behaviors aligned with expert reasoning. We propose an $α$-based early stopping criterion and a spectral model selection protocol, and validate both against cross-validated F1 baselines. Sparse Lanczos approximations make the framework scalable to large datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种简单有效的时间无关汇总统计方法处理不规则多元时间序列缺失值问题，通过计算均值、标准差、变化均值和变异性四个特征，在医疗数据集上超越复杂深度学习模型，并发现缺失模式本身包含预测信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗等领域中的不规则多元时间序列及其缺失值对预测建模构成重大挑战。现有深度学习方法多聚焦于复杂的时间插值或专用架构，计算成本高且难以解释。

Method: 提出消除时间轴的简化方法：为每个变量提取四个关键汇总统计量——观测值的均值、标准差，以及连续观测间变化的均值和变异性，构建固定维度特征向量，然后使用逻辑回归或XGBoost等标准分类器进行预测。同时探索缺失指示器作为特征。

Result: 在PhysioNet 2012/2019、PAMAP2和MIMIC-III四个生物医学数据集上实现最优性能，比transformer和图模型AUROC/AUPRC提升0.5-1.7%，准确率/F1提升1.1-1.7%，计算复杂度显著降低。消融研究证实特征提取是性能提升的关键。在败血症预测中，仅使用缺失指示器就达到94.2% AUROC，仅比原始数据低1.6%。

Conclusion: 该结果挑战了复杂时间建模的必要性，证明当任务允许时间无关表示时，简单的汇总统计方法可提供高效、可解释的不规则时间序列分类方案，且缺失模式本身可作为强预测信号。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series with missing values present significant challenges for predictive modeling in domains such as healthcare. While deep learning approaches often focus on temporal interpolation or complex architectures to handle irregularities, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative: extracting time-agnostic summary statistics to eliminate the temporal axis. Our method computes four key features per variable-mean and standard deviation of observed values, as well as the mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations to create a fixed-dimensional representation. These features are then utilized with standard classifiers, such as logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluated on four biomedical datasets (PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform raw/imputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction (PhysioNet, 2019), where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2% AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6% lower than using original raw data as input. Our results challenge the necessity of complex temporal modeling when task objectives permit time-agnostic representations, providing an efficient and interpretable solution for irregular time series classification.

Result: 在Atari、DeepMind Control Suite和Google Football任务中，AAT性能达到或超越主流对抗攻击基线水平

Conclusion: 该方法显著增强了对抗样本的时序相关性，为深度强化学习系统的安全性评估提供了更有效的攻击手段

Abstract: Extensive research demonstrates that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models are susceptible to adversarially constructed inputs (i.e., adversarial examples), which can mislead the agent to take suboptimal or unsafe actions. Recent methods improve attack effectiveness by leveraging future rewards to guide adversarial perturbation generation over sequential time steps (i.e., reward-based attacks). However, these methods are unable to capture dependencies between different time steps in the perturbation generation process, resulting in a weak temporal correlation between the current perturbation and previous perturbations.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer (AAT), which can generate adversarial examples with stronger temporal correlations (i.e., time-correlated adversarial examples) to improve the attack performance. AAT employs a multi-scale causal self-attention (MSCSA) mechanism to dynamically capture dependencies between historical information from different time periods and the current state, thus enhancing the correlation between the current perturbation and the previous perturbation. Moreover, AAT introduces a weighted advantage mechanism, which quantifies the effectiveness of a perturbation in a given state and guides the generation process toward high-performance adversarial examples by sampling high-advantage regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of AAT matches or surpasses mainstream adversarial attack baselines on Atari, DeepMind Control Suite and Google football tasks.

### [88] [Interpolation-Driven Machine Learning Approaches for Plume Shine Dose Estimation: A Comparison of XGBoost, Random Forest, and TabNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19584)
*Biswajit Sadhu,Kalpak Gupte,Trijit Sadhu,S. Anand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops an interpolation-assisted machine learning framework for rapid plume shine dose estimation. Using pyDOSEIA-generated data for 17 radionuclides, the study shows XGBoost achieves highest accuracy with interpolated high-resolution data, while interpretability analysis reveals tree-based models prioritize geometry-dispersion features whereas TabNet distributes attention more broadly. A web GUI enables practical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning applications in radiation dose assessment are limited by safety-critical constraints, scarce training data, and challenges in selecting architectures for physics-dominated systems. Conventional photon-transport calculations for plume shine dose are computationally expensive, creating need for rapid yet accurate surrogate models for nuclear safety and emergency response.

Method: Developed interpolation-assisted ML framework using discrete dose datasets from pyDOSEIA suite (17 gamma-emitting radionuclides, varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability). Applied shape-preserving interpolation to augment data and create dense training set. Evaluated Random Forest, XGBoost, and TabNet models. Conducted interpretability analysis via permutation importance and attention-based feature attribution.

Result: All models showed higher accuracy with interpolated high-resolution data versus discrete data. XGBoost consistently achieved highest predictive accuracy. Interpretability analysis revealed tree-based models primarily use dominant geometry-dispersion features (release height, stability, distance) with radionuclide identity as secondary input, while TabNet distributes attention across multiple variables.

Conclusion: The interpolation-assisted ML framework effectively enables rapid plume shine dose estimation. XGBoost's superior performance makes it suitable for deployment, while different feature utilization patterns across models provide insights for architecture selection. The developed web-based GUI facilitates practical implementation and transparent validation against photon-transport reference calculations.

Abstract: Despite the success of machine learning (ML) in surrogate modeling, its use in radiation dose assessment is limited by safety-critical constraints, scarce training-ready data, and challenges in selecting suitable architectures for physics-dominated systems. Within this context, rapid and accurate plume shine dose estimation serves as a practical test case, as it is critical for nuclear facility safety assessment and radiological emergency response, while conventional photon-transport-based calculations remain computationally expensive. In this work, an interpolation-assisted ML framework was developed using discrete dose datasets generated with the pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability categories. The datasets were augmented using shape-preserving interpolation to construct dense, high-resolution training data. Two tree-based ML models (Random Forest and XGBoost) and one deep learning (DL) model (TabNet) were evaluated to examine predictive performance and sensitivity to dataset resolution. All models showed higher prediction accuracy with the interpolated high-resolution dataset than with the discrete data; however, XGBoost consistently achieved the highest accuracy. Interpretability analysis using permutation importance (tree-based models) and attention-based feature attribution (TabNet) revealed that performance differences stem from how the models utilize input features. Tree-based models focus mainly on dominant geometry-dispersion features (release height, stability category, and downwind distance), treating radionuclide identity as a secondary input, whereas TabNet distributes attention more broadly across multiple variables. For practical deployment, a web-based GUI was developed for interactive scenario evaluation and transparent comparison with photon-transport reference calculations.

### [89] [ISO-Bench: Can Coding Agents Optimize Real-World Inference Workloads?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19594)
*Ayush Nangia,Shikhar Mishra,Aman Gokrani,Paras Chopra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISO-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating coding agents on real-world LLM inference optimization tasks from vLLM and SGLang. Using 54 tasks with both execution-based and LLM-based metrics, it finds agents struggle to implement solutions even when identifying correct bottlenecks, and that scaffolding matters as much as the underlying model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for coding agents heavily rely on runtime-based metrics which can be gamed without capturing actual code intent. There is a need for a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates real-world coding optimization tasks using both execution-based and LLM-based metrics for complete assessment.

Method: Created ISO-Bench with 54 real-world inference optimization tasks curated from merged pull requests in vLLM and SGLang frameworks. Each task provides a codebase and bottleneck description for agents to optimize. Evaluation combines hard (execution-based) and soft (LLM-based) metrics.

Result: 1. No single coding agent dominates across different codebases. 2. Agents frequently identify correct bottlenecks but fail to implement working solutions. 3. Agents with identical underlying models show substantial performance differences, indicating scaffolding is as important as the model itself.

Conclusion: ISO-Bench provides a more robust evaluation framework by combining multiple metrics. It reveals significant gaps between bottleneck identification and solution implementation capabilities of current agents, and highlights the critical role of scaffolding in agent performance. Future work should focus on improving solution execution and scaffolding design.

Abstract: We introduce ISO-Bench, a benchmark for coding agents to test their capabilities on real-world inference optimization tasks. These tasks were taken from vLLM and SGLang, two of the most popular LLM serving frameworks. Each task provides an agent with a codebase and bottleneck description, whereby the agent must produce an optimization patch evaluated against expert human solutions. We curated 54 tasks from merged pull requests with measurable performance improvements. While existing benchmarks heavily use runtime-based metrics, such approaches can be gamed to pass tests without capturing the actual intent of the code changes. Therefore, we combine both hard (execution-based) and soft (LLM-based) metrics to show that both are necessary for complete evaluation. While evaluating both closed and open-source coding agents, we find no single agent dominates across codebases. Surprisingly, agents often identify correct bottlenecks but fail to execute working solutions. We also show that agents with identical underlying models differ substantially, suggesting scaffolding is as important as the model.

Motivation: 现有图Transformer存在两大瓶颈：计算复杂度随图规模指数级增长，以及节点级注意力机制在分布外（OOD）场景下泛化能力差。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：第一阶段利用双码本重建节点特征与图结构，学习语义丰富的'图编码'；第二阶段基于跨码本转换在'图令牌'层级执行注意力机制，降低计算复杂度并提升泛化性。

Result: 在多种规模数据集上的实验表明，VecFormer在性能和推理速度上均优于现有图Transformer模型。

Conclusion: VecFormer是一种高效且泛化性强的图表示学习模型，尤其适用于分布外节点分类任务。

Abstract: Graph Transformer has demonstrated impressive capabilities in the field of graph representation learning. However, existing approaches face two critical challenges: (1) most models suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity, making it difficult to scale to large graphs; (2) attention mechanisms based on node-level operations limit the flexibility of the model and result in poor generalization performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{VecFormer} (the \textbf{Vec}tor Quantized Graph Trans\textbf{former}), an efficient and highly generalizable model for node classification, particularly under OOD settings. VecFormer adopts a two-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, two codebooks are used to reconstruct the node features and the graph structure, aiming to learn the rich semantic \texttt{Graph Codes}. In the second stage, attention mechanisms are performed at the \texttt{Graph Token} level based on the transformed cross codebook, reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on datasets of various sizes demonstrate that VecFormer outperforms the existing Graph Transformer in both performance and speed.

Conclusion: 模型特定的CAVI算法在保持精度的同时实现巨大加速，验证了其价值；结构化变分方法可解决速度与区间校准间的权衡问题。

Abstract: We develop a Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm for Bayesian Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) regression with linear weight parameteri zations. The model separates impact coe cients from weighting function parameters through a normalization constraint, creating a bilinear structure that renders generic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers unreliable while preserving conditional conju gacy exploitable by CAVI. Each variational update admits a closed-form solution: Gaussian for regression coe cients and weight parameters, Inverse-Gamma for the error variance. The algorithm propagates uncertainty across blocks through second moments, distinguishing it from naive plug-in approximations. In a Monte Carlo study spanning 21 data-generating con gurations with up to 50 predictors, CAVI produces posterior means nearly identical to a block Gibbs sampler benchmark while achieving speedups of 107x to 1,772x (Table 9). Generic automatic di eren tiation VI (ADVI), by contrast, produces bias 714 times larger while being orders of magnitude slower, con rming the value of model-speci c derivations. Weight function parameters maintain excellent calibration (coverage above 92%) across all con gurations. Impact coe cient credible intervals exhibit the underdispersion characteristic of mean- eld approximations, with coverage declining from 89% to 55% as the number of predictors grows a documented trade-o between speed and interval calibration that structured variational methods can address. An empirical application to realized volatility forecasting on S&P 500 daily returns con rms that CAVI and Gibbs sampling yield virtually identical point forecasts, with CAVI completing each monthly estimation in under 10 milliseconds.

Conclusion: 跳跃世界模型通过预测多步动态和一致性训练，有效解决了时序抽象组合规划的挑战，为长时域复杂任务提供了更优的决策框架。

Abstract: The ability to plan with temporal abstractions is central to intelligent decision-making. Rather than reasoning over primitive actions, we study agents that compose pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions, enabling solutions to complex tasks that no constituent alone can solve. Such compositional planning remains elusive as compounding errors in long-horizon predictions make it challenging to estimate the visitation distribution induced by sequencing policies. Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy. We further demonstrate how to combine these generative predictions to estimate the value of executing arbitrary sequences of policies over varying timescales. Empirically, we find that compositional planning with jumpy world models significantly improves zero-shot performance across a wide range of base policies on challenging manipulation and navigation tasks, yielding, on average, a 200% relative improvement over planning with primitive actions on long-horizon tasks.

*Luhan Tang,Longxuan Yu,Shaorong Zhang,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals that discrete diffusion language models have a fundamental sampling problem: even with perfect denoisers, few-step samplers fail to sample from the correct distribution, and common metrics like NLL and perplexity don't guarantee sampling quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) is challenging because existing metrics conflate denoiser approximation error with sampler-induced error from sampling dynamics, a problem that doesn't exist for autoregressive models (ARMs) where sampling exactly reflects the learned probability model.

Method: Introduce a "sampler-centric oracle framework" that replaces learned denoisers with an exact Hidden Markov Model posterior derived from a ground-truth Markov chain, isolating sampler-induced error in a controlled setting.

Result: Few-step discrete diffusion samplers are not distributionally correct even under an oracle denoiser, with transition-level mismatch that vanishes only as the number of steps approaches the sequence length. Improvements in NLL, generative perplexity, or MAUVE do not imply correct sampling.

Conclusion: Sampling quality in dLLMs is fundamentally limited by sampling dynamics, not just denoiser quality. Current evaluation metrics are insufficient for assessing sampling correctness, and better samplers (not just better denoisers) are needed for few-step generation.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) provide a fast and flexible alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs) via iterative denoising with parallel updates. However, their evaluation is challenging: existing metrics conflate denoiser approximation error with sampler-induced error from the sampling dynamics, a problem that does not arise for ARMs whose autoregressive sampling exactly reflects the learned probability model. We introduce a sampler-centric oracle framework that replaces learned denoisers with an exact Hidden Markov Model posterior derived from a ground-truth Markov chain, isolating sampler-induced error in a controlled setting. We show that few-step discrete diffusion samplers are not distributionally correct even under an oracle denoiser, with transition-level mismatch that vanishes only as the number of steps approaches the sequence length. Moreover, improvements in negative log-likelihood, generative perplexity, or MAUVE do not imply correct sampling. Code is available at https://luhantang.github.io/dllm_sampler

*Vishnu Subramanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies a minimal continual learning agent to isolate how internal representations evolve over time, finding a natural transition from plastic to stable regimes and demonstrating recovery from semantic perturbations without complex mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many continual learning approaches focus on task performance rather than understanding the evolution of internal representations. The authors aim to isolate representational dynamics from architectural complexity and optimization objectives.

Method: The authors designed a minimal agent with a persistent state vector updated incrementally with new textual data. They quantified representational change using cosine similarity between successive normalized state vectors and defined a stability metric to track changes over time.

Result: Experiments across eight executions showed a transition from an initial plastic regime to a stable representational regime under consistent input. When a semantic perturbation was introduced, it caused a bounded decrease in similarity, followed by recovery and restabilization under subsequent coherent input.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that meaningful stability-plasticity tradeoffs can emerge in a minimal, stateful learning system without explicit regularization, replay, or architectural complexity. It establishes a transparent empirical baseline for studying representational accumulation and adaptation in continual learning systems.

Abstract: Continual learning systems are increasingly deployed in environments where retraining or reset is infeasible, yet many approaches emphasize task performance rather than the evolution of internal representations over time. In this work, we study a minimal continual learning agent designed to isolate representational dynamics from architectural complexity and optimization objectives. The agent maintains a persistent state vector across executions and incrementally updates it as new textual data is introduced. We quantify representational change using cosine similarity between successive normalized state vectors and define a stability metric over time intervals. Longitudinal experiments across eight executions reveal a transition from an initial plastic regime to a stable representational regime under consistent input. A deliberately introduced semantic perturbation produces a bounded decrease in similarity, followed by recovery and restabilization under subsequent coherent input. These results demonstrate that meaningful stability plasticity tradeoffs can emerge in a minimal, stateful learning system without explicit regularization, replay, or architectural complexity. The work establishes a transparent empirical baseline for studying representational accumulation and adaptation in continual learning systems.

*Xinyu Yuan,Xixian Liu,Ya Shi Zhang,Zuobai Zhang,Hongyu Guo,Jian Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PerturbDiff introduces a diffusion-based generative model that operates on probability distributions rather than individual cells, enabling accurate prediction of single-cell responses to perturbations by capturing systematic variability from unobserved latent factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-throughput single-cell sequencing is destructive, preventing observation of the same cell before and after perturbation. Existing models assume single fixed response distributions per condition, but real responses vary due to unobservable factors (microenvironment, batch effects), requiring modeling of distributional manifolds.

Method: Shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions. Embeds distributions as points in Hilbert space and defines a diffusion-based generative process directly over probability distributions to capture population-level response shifts across hidden factors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction on established datasets and demonstrates substantially better generalization to unseen perturbations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PerturbDiff advances virtual cell modeling by accounting for response variability through distribution-level generative modeling, addressing a fundamental challenge in systems biology for accurate simulation of cellular responses.

Abstract: Building Virtual Cells that can accurately simulate cellular responses to perturbations is a long-standing goal in systems biology. A fundamental challenge is that high-throughput single-cell sequencing is destructive: the same cell cannot be observed both before and after a perturbation. Thus, perturbation prediction requires mapping unpaired control and perturbed populations. Existing models address this by learning maps between distributions, but typically assume a single fixed response distribution when conditioned on observed cellular context (e.g., cell type) and the perturbation type. In reality, responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors such as microenvironmental fluctuations and complex batch effects, forming a manifold of possible distributions for the same observed conditions. To account for this variability, we introduce PerturbDiff, which shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions. By embedding distributions as points in a Hilbert space, we define a diffusion-based generative process operating directly over probability distributions. This allows PerturbDiff to capture population-level response shifts across hidden factors. Benchmarks on established datasets show that PerturbDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction and generalizes substantially better to unseen perturbations.

Method: 提出Decision MetaMamba (DMM)结构：1) 用基于密集层的序列混合器替换Mamba的token混合器；2) 修改位置结构以保留局部信息；3) 在Mamba之前执行考虑所有通道的序列混合，防止选择性扫描和残差门控造成的信息丢失。

Result: 大量实验表明，DMM在各种RL任务上实现了最先进的(state-of-the-art)性能。

Conclusion: DMM以紧凑的参数占用空间取得了优异结果，展现出强大的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Mamba-based models have drawn much attention in offline RL. However, their selective mechanism often detrimental when key steps in RL sequences are omitted. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective structure, called Decision MetaMamba (DMM), which replaces Mamba's token mixer with a dense layer-based sequence mixer and modifies positional structure to preserve local information. By performing sequence mixing that considers all channels simultaneously before Mamba, DMM prevents information loss due to selective scanning and residual gating. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DMM delivers the state-of-the-art performance across diverse RL tasks. Furthermore, DMM achieves these results with a compact parameter footprint, demonstrating strong potential for real-world applications.

*Jin Liu,Yinbin Miao,Ning Xi,Junkang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LA-LoRA方法解决DPFL中LoRA的微调性能下降问题，通过解耦梯度交互和校准更新方向，在严格隐私约束下实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在差分隐私联邦学习中微调大视觉模型和大语言模型面临隐私-效用权衡，LoRA虽能降低计算通信成本，但直接应用于DPFL会导致性能显著下降，尤其对LVMs。分析揭示三个关键挑战：梯度耦合、噪声放大和模型尖锐度问题

Method: LA-LoRA（局部交替LoRA）：通过交替更新两个低秩矩阵来解耦梯度交互，并跨客户端对齐更新方向，增强在严格隐私约束下的鲁棒性

Result: 在Swin Transformer和RoBERTa上实现SOTA性能，对DP噪声具有强鲁棒性。在ε=1严格隐私预算下，LA-LoRA在Tiny-ImageNet上微调Swin-B模型时，比最佳基线RoLoRA测试准确率高出16.83%

Conclusion: LA-LoRA有效解决了DPFL中LoRA面临的三大挑战，理论上强化了噪声环境下的收敛保证，实践上证明了在大模型和跨模型类型上的广泛适用性

Abstract: Fine-tuning large vision models (LVMs) and large language models (LLMs) under differentially private federated learning (DPFL) is hindered by a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a promising parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, reduces computational and communication costs by introducing two trainable low-rank matrices while freezing pre-trained weights. However, directly applying LoRA in DPFL settings leads to performance degradation, especially in LVMs. Our analysis reveals three previously underexplored challenges: (1) gradient coupling caused by the simultaneous update of two asymmetric low-rank matrices, (2) compounded noise amplification under differential privacy, and (3) sharpness of the global aggregated model in the parameter space. To address these issues, we propose LA-LoRA (\textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}lternating \textbf{LoRA}), a novel approach that decouples gradient interactions and aligns update directions across clients to enhance robustness under stringent privacy constraints. Theoretically, LA-LoRA strengthens convergence guarantees in noisy federated environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Swin Transformer and RoBERTa models, showcasing robustness to DP noise and broad applicability across both LVMs and LLMs. For example, when fine-tuning the Swin-B model on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset under a strict privacy budget ($ε= 1$), LA-LoRA outperforms the best baseline, RoLoRA, by 16.83\% in test accuracy. Code is provided in \repolink.

Motivation: AdamW在大规模模型训练中加速效果显著，但直接应用于差分隐私联邦学习时面临数据异质性、隐私噪声放大二阶矩方差、引入估计偏差以及加剧客户端漂移三大挑战。

Method: 提出DP-FedAdamW，通过稳定二阶矩估计方差、去除差分隐私引入的偏差，以及将局部更新与全局下降方向对齐来缓解客户端漂移，恢复AdamW在DP环境下的性能。

Result: 理论贡献包括无偏二阶矩估计器、无需异质性假设的线性加速收敛率以及更紧的(ε,δ)-DP保证；在语言/视觉Transformer和ResNet-18上验证有效性，Tiny-ImageNet任务中以ε=1超越SOTA达5.83%。

Conclusion: DP-FedAdamW成功解决了AdamW在差分隐私联邦学习中的适应性问题，在保障隐私的同时实现了收敛效率与鲁棒性的平衡，为大规模隐私保护机器学习提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Balancing convergence efficiency and robustness under Differential Privacy (DP) is a central challenge in Federated Learning (FL). While AdamW accelerates training and fine-tuning in large-scale models, we find that directly applying it to Differentially Private FL (DPFL) suffers from three major issues: (i) data heterogeneity and privacy noise jointly amplify the variance of second-moment estimator, (ii) DP perturbations bias the second-moment estimator, and (iii) DP amplify AdamW sensitivity to local overfitting, worsening client drift. We propose DP-FedAdamW, the first AdamW-based optimizer for DPFL. It restores AdamW under DP by stabilizing second-moment variance, removing DP-induced bias, and aligning local updates to the global descent to curb client drift. Theoretically, we establish an unbiased second-moment estimator and prove a linearly accelerated convergence rate without any heterogeneity assumption, while providing tighter $(\varepsilon,δ)$-DP guarantees. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-FedAdamW across language and vision Transformers and ResNet-18. On Tiny-ImageNet (Swin-Base, $\varepsilon=1$), DP-FedAdamW outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 5.83\%. The code is available in Appendix.

TL;DR: 提出PaReGTA框架，利用预训练LLM将纵向EHR事件转换为带时间线索的文本模板，通过轻量对比微调学习就诊嵌入，并使用混合时间池化聚合为患者表示，在39,088名偏头痛患者数据上优于稀疏基线，且比深度序列模型更稳定


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化电子健康记录(EHR)中的时序信息常在稀疏独热或计数表示中丢失，而序列模型计算成本高且需要大量数据，现有方法在数据有限场景下表现不佳

Method: 将纵向EHR事件转换为带明确时间线索的就诊级模板文本；通过对句嵌入模型进行轻量对比微调学习领域适应的就诊嵌入；采用混合时间池化捕获近期和全局重要就诊信息，聚合为固定维患者表示；引入表示移位分数(RSS)进行可解释性分析

Result: 在All of Us研究计划的39,088名偏头痛患者队列中，PaReGTA在偏头痛类型分类任务上显著优于稀疏基线方法，而深度序列模型在该队列中表现不稳定

Conclusion: PaReGTA能有效保留EHR时序信息，在数据有限情况下仍表现良好，具有模型无关性和可解释性优势，可受益于未来EHR专用句嵌入模型的发展

Abstract: Temporal information in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is often lost in sparse one-hot or count-based representations, while sequence models can be costly and data-hungry. We propose PaReGTA, an LLM-based encoding framework that (i) converts longitudinal EHR events into visit-level templated text with explicit temporal cues, (ii) learns domain-adapted visit embeddings via lightweight contrastive fine-tuning of a sentence-embedding model, and (iii) aggregates visit embeddings into a fixed-dimensional patient representation using hybrid temporal pooling that captures both recency and globally informative visits. Because PaReGTA does not require training from scratch but instead utilizes a pre-trained LLM, it can perform well even in data-limited cohorts. Furthermore, PaReGTA is model-agnostic and can benefit from future EHR-specialized sentence-embedding models. For interpretability, we introduce PaReGTA-RSS (Representation Shift Score), which quantifies clinically defined factor importance by recomputing representations after targeted factor removal and projecting representation shifts through a machine learning model. On 39,088 migraine patients from the All of Us Research Program, PaReGTA outperforms sparse baselines for migraine type classification while deep sequential models were unstable in our cohort.

### [100] [Understanding the Curse of Unrolling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19733)
*Sheheryar Mehmood,Florian Knoll,Peter Ochs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides non-asymptotic analysis explaining the "curse of unrolling" (initial divergence of computed Jacobians from true values in algorithm unrolling), identifies key algorithmic factors causing it, shows truncation of early derivative iterations mitigates the issue while saving memory, and reveals warm-starting in bilevel optimization acts as implicit truncation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing asymptotic analysis of algorithm unrolling fails to explain the initial divergence ("curse of unrolling") between computed derivatives and true Jacobians, necessitating a non-asymptotic understanding of this behavior and its governing factors.

Method: Conducts non-asymptotic analysis to identify the origin of the curse of unrolling and the algorithmic parameters influencing its severity, then validates findings through numerical experiments on representative examples.

Result: Truncating early iterations in the derivative computation effectively reduces the curse of unrolling and simultaneously lowers memory demands; additionally, warm-starting in bilevel optimization naturally implements an implicit truncation mechanism.

Conclusion: The analysis clarifies the fundamental behavior of unrolled derivatives, provides a practical truncation-based solution to mitigate the curse while improving efficiency, and demonstrates that common techniques like warm-starting inherently alleviate the problem.

Abstract: Algorithm unrolling is ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly in hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning, where Jacobians of solution mappings are computed by differentiating through iterative algorithms. Although unrolling is known to yield asymptotically correct Jacobians under suitable conditions, recent work has shown that the derivative iterates may initially diverge from the true Jacobian, a phenomenon known as the curse of unrolling. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis that explains the origin of this behavior and identifies the algorithmic factors that govern it. We show that truncating early iterations of the derivative computation mitigates the curse while simultaneously reducing memory requirements. Finally, we demonstrate that warm-starting in bilevel optimization naturally induces an implicit form of truncation, providing a practical remedy. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments on representative examples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型动态图异常检测框架，通过残差编码、约束损失和双边界优化，从正常/未标记数据中学习判别边界，同时有效利用有限的标记异常而不发生过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图异常检测对实际应用至关重要，但标记异常的稀缺性使其面临挑战。现有无监督方法边界模糊，而半监督方法容易过拟合并泛化能力差。

Method: 框架包含三个核心组件：(1) 残差表示编码，捕捉当前交互与历史上下文的偏差；(2) 约束损失，将正常表示限制在两个同轴超球面构成的区间内；(3) 双边界优化策略，利用归一化流建模正常数据的对数似然分布来学习判别性鲁棒边界。

Result: 大量实验表明，该框架在多种评估设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合未标记正常数据和有限异常标签，有效解决了当前DGAD方法的局限性，实现了可泛化的判别边界学习。

Abstract: Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is critical for many real-world applications but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies. Existing methods are either unsupervised or semi-supervised: unsupervised methods avoid the need for labeled anomalies but often produce ambiguous boundary, whereas semi-supervised methods can overfit to the limited labeled anomalies and generalize poorly to unseen anomalies. To address this gap, we consider a largely underexplored problem in DGAD: learning a discriminative boundary from normal/unlabeled data, while leveraging limited labeled anomalies \textbf{when available} without sacrificing generalization to unseen anomalies. To this end, we propose an effective, generalizable, and model-agnostic framework with three main components: (i) residual representation encoding that capture deviations between current interactions and their historical context, providing anomaly-relevant signals; (ii) a restriction loss that constrain the normal representations within an interval bounded by two co-centered hyperspheres, ensuring consistent scales while keeping anomalies separable; (iii) a bi-boundary optimization strategy that learns a discriminative and robust boundary using the normal log-likelihood distribution modeled by a normalizing flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework across diverse evaluation settings.

TL;DR: 针对LLM的安全隐患，本文提出 BarrierSteer，一种基于控制屏障函数(CBF)的框架。该方法通过在潜在表示空间嵌入可学习的非线性安全约束，在推理时高效拦截不安全响应，无需修改模型参数即可显著提升安全性，同时保持模型原有性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs性能先进，但其在高风险场景下面临对抗攻击和生成不安全内容的严重威胁，亟需兼具理论严谨性和实践有效性的安全机制。

Method: 提出 BarrierSteer 框架：1) 在LLM潜在空间嵌入可学习的非线性安全约束；2) 基于控制屏障函数设计 steering 机制，实时检测并阻止不安全响应轨迹；3) 支持多约束高效合并；4) 无需微调模型参数，保持原始能力。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在多种模型和任务上大幅降低对抗攻击成功率，减少不安全生成，并超越现有方法。

Conclusion: BarrierSteer 通过潜在空间CBF提供了一种计算高效、理论坚实的安全保障方案，在不牺牲模型性能的前提下有效提升安全性。

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks and unsafe content generation remains a major obstacle to deployment, particularly in high-stakes settings. Addressing this challenge requires safety mechanisms that are both practically effective and supported by rigorous theory. We introduce BarrierSteer, a novel framework that formalizes response safety by embedding learned non-linear safety constraints directly into the model's latent representation space. BarrierSteer employs a steering mechanism based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to efficiently detect and prevent unsafe response trajectories during inference with high precision. By enforcing multiple safety constraints through efficient constraint merging, without modifying the underlying LLM parameters, BarrierSteer preserves the model's original capabilities and performance. We provide theoretical results establishing that applying CBFs in latent space offers a principled and computationally efficient approach to enforcing safety. Our experiments across multiple models and datasets show that BarrierSteer substantially reduces adversarial success rates, decreases unsafe generations, and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a prominent observational epidemiological research method designed to address unobserved confounding when estimating causal effects. However, core assumptions -- particularly the independence between instruments and unobserved confounders -- are often violated due to population stratification or assortative mating. Leveraging the increasing availability of multi-environment data, we propose a representation learning framework that exploits cross-environment invariance to recover latent exogenous components of genetic instruments. We provide theoretical guarantees for identifying these latent instruments under various mixing mechanisms and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and semi-synthetic experiments using data from the All of Us Research Hub.

Abstract: Inspired by behavioral science, we propose Behavior Learning (BL), a novel general-purpose machine learning framework that learns interpretable and identifiable optimization structures from data, ranging from single optimization problems to hierarchical compositions. It unifies predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability, and identifiability, with broad applicability to scientific domains involving optimization. BL parameterizes a compositional utility function built from intrinsically interpretable modular blocks, which induces a data distribution for prediction and generation. Each block represents and can be written in symbolic form as a utility maximization problem (UMP), a foundational paradigm in behavioral science and a universal framework of optimization. BL supports architectures ranging from a single UMP to hierarchical compositions, the latter modeling hierarchical optimization structures. Its smooth and monotone variant (IBL) guarantees identifiability. Theoretically, we establish the universal approximation property of BL, and analyze the M-estimation properties of IBL. Empirically, BL demonstrates strong predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability and scalability to high-dimensional data.

Conclusion: 通过基于机制相似性的任务嵌入将因果感知融入贝叶斯元学习，成功解决了分布外适应问题并缓解了负迁移，为现实部署场景提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Meta-learning methods perform well on new within-distribution tasks but often fail when adapting to out-of-distribution target tasks, where transfer from source tasks can induce negative transfer. We propose a causally-aware Bayesian meta-learning method, by conditioning task-specific priors on precomputed latent causal task embeddings, enabling transfer based on mechanistic similarity rather than spurious correlations. Our approach explicitly considers realistic deployment settings where access to target-task data is limited, and adaptation relies on noisy (expert-provided) pairwise judgments of causal similarity between source and target tasks. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that conditioning on causal embeddings controls prior mismatch and mitigates negative transfer under task shift. Empirically, we demonstrate reductions in negative transfer and improved out-of-distribution adaptation in both controlled simulations and a large-scale real-world clinical prediction setting for cross-disease transfer, where causal embeddings align with underlying clinical mechanisms.

Conclusion: 需制定可执行方案，将数据节俭从理论倡导落实为具体实践，推动负责任的AI发展。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the machine learning community must move from preaching to practising data frugality for responsible artificial intelligence (AI) development. For long, progress has been equated with ever-larger datasets, driving remarkable advances but now yielding increasingly diminishing performance gains alongside rising energy use and carbon emissions. While awareness of data frugal approaches has grown, their adoption has remained rhetorical, and data scaling continues to dominate development practice. We argue that this gap between preach and practice must be closed, as continued data scaling entails substantial and under-accounted environmental impacts. To ground our position, we provide indicative estimates of the energy use and carbon emissions associated with the downstream use of ImageNet-1K. We then present empirical evidence that data frugality is both practical and beneficial, demonstrating that coreset-based subset selection can substantially reduce training energy consumption with little loss in accuracy, while also mitigating dataset bias. Finally, we outline actionable recommendations for moving data frugality from rhetorical preach to concrete practice for responsible development of AI.

Abstract: Concept drift -- the change of the distribution over time -- poses significant challenges for learning systems and is of central interest for monitoring. Understanding drift is thus paramount, and drift localization -- determining which samples are affected by the drift -- is essential. While several approaches exist, most rely on local testing schemes, which tend to fail in high-dimensional, low-signal settings. In this work, we consider a fundamentally different approach based on conformal predictions. We discuss and show the shortcomings of common approaches and demonstrate the performance of our approach on state-of-the-art image datasets.

Abstract: We present a family of generalized Hessian estimators of the objective using random direction stochastic approximation (RDSA) by utilizing only noisy function measurements. The form of each estimator and the order of the bias depend on the number of function measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that estimators with more function measurements exhibit lower-order estimation bias. We show the asymptotic unbiasedness of the estimators. We also perform asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence analyses for stochastic Newton methods that incorporate our generalized Hessian estimators. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSDR proposes a dual-scale diversity regularization framework to combat limited exploration in RLVR, introducing global diversity among correct reasoning paths and local token-level entropy within correct trajectories, coupled via a global-to-local allocation mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods suffer from limited exploration as policies collapse onto few reasoning patterns; conventional entropy regularization only provides local stochasticity, failing to induce path-level diversity and causing weak, unstable learning signals in group-based optimization.

Method: DSDR decomposes diversity into global (diversity among correct reasoning trajectories for distinct solution modes) and local (length-invariant token-level entropy regularization restricted to correct trajectories to prevent entropy collapse). The two scales are coupled through a global-to-local allocation mechanism emphasizing local regularization for distinctive correct trajectories.

Result: Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show consistent improvements in accuracy and pass@k, demonstrating the effectiveness of dual-scale diversity for deep exploration.

Conclusion: Dual-scale diversity regularization is crucial for deep exploration in RLVR; DSDR successfully balances global solution mode diversity with local intra-mode exploration while preserving correctness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiers (RLVR) is a central paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet existing methods often suffer from limited exploration. Policies tend to collapse onto a few reasoning patterns and prematurely stop deep exploration, while conventional entropy regularization introduces only local stochasticity and fails to induce meaningful path-level diversity, leading to weak and unstable learning signals in group-based policy optimization. We propose DSDR, a Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization reinforcement learning framework that decomposes diversity in LLM reasoning into global and coupling components. Globally, DSDR promotes diversity among correct reasoning trajectories to explore distinct solution modes. Locally, it applies a length-invariant, token-level entropy regularization restricted to correct trajectories, preventing entropy collapse within each mode while preserving correctness. The two scales are coupled through a global-to-local allocation mechanism that emphasizes local regularization for more distinctive correct trajectories. We provide theoretical support showing that DSDR preserves optimal correctness under bounded regularization, sustains informative learning signals in group-based optimization, and yields a principled global-to-local coupling rule. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy and pass@k, highlighting the importance of dual-scale diversity for deep exploration in RLVR.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将质谱转化为完整分子结构是一个困难且欠定义的反问题，对生物学洞察、新代谢物发现和化学研究至关重要。

Method: 两阶段编码器-解码器架构：第一阶段采用公式受限的transformer将质谱编码为化学信息嵌入；第二阶段使用离散流匹配解码器从潜嵌入重建分子。

Result: 在严格评估中，MSFlow能以高达45%的准确率将质谱转化为分子结构，相比当前最优方法提升高达14倍。

Conclusion: MSFlow在小型分子结构解析任务上实现了突破性进展，模型已开源供非商业用户使用。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry is a powerful and widely used tool for identifying molecular structures due to its sensitivity and ability to profile complex samples. However, translating spectra into full molecular structures is a difficult, under-defined inverse problem. Overcoming this problem is crucial for enabling biological insight, discovering new metabolites, and advancing chemical research across multiple fields. To this end, we develop MSFlow, a two-stage encoder-decoder flow-matching generative model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the structure elucidation task for small molecules. In the first stage, we adopt a formula-restricted transformer model for encoding mass spectra into a continuous and chemically informative embedding space, while in the second stage, we train a decoder flow matching model to reconstruct molecules from latent embeddings of mass spectra. We present ablation studies demonstrating the importance of using information-preserving molecular descriptors for encoding mass spectra and motivate the use of our discrete flow-based decoder. Our rigorous evaluation demonstrates that MSFlow can accurately translate up to 45 percent of molecular mass spectra into their corresponding molecular representations - an improvement of up to fourteen-fold over the current state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: 在对抗训练中联合利用扩散模型的内部表征和生成的合成数据是一种有效策略，能在多个数据集上提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Incorporating diffusion-generated synthetic data into adversarial training (AT) has been shown to substantially improve the training of robust image classifiers. In this work, we extend the role of diffusion models beyond merely generating synthetic data, examining whether their internal representations, which encode meaningful features of the data, can provide additional benefits for robust classifier training. Through systematic experiments, we show that diffusion models offer representations that are both diverse and partially robust, and that explicitly incorporating diffusion representations as an auxiliary learning signal during AT consistently improves robustness across settings. Furthermore, our representation analysis indicates that incorporating diffusion models into AT encourages more disentangled features, while diffusion representations and diffusion-generated synthetic data play complementary roles in shaping representations. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet validate these findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly leveraging diffusion representations and synthetic data within AT.

TL;DR: 该论文对比研究了自回归(AR)与非自回归(NAR)模型在规划任务中的表现，发现NAR模型能通过利用未来token进行反向解码来规避复杂的前瞻遍历机制，从而以更少的训练样本和浅层架构实现完美准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示AR Transformer模型在多步前瞻规划任务中的能力局限，探究NAR模型（如离散扩散模型）在解决此类问题时是否具有效率优势，并理解两种范式在解决规划问题时的根本机制差异。

Method: 通过在规划任务上训练AR和NAR模型，并进行训练与推理机制的动力学分析，研究揭示了规划问题中的关键不对称性：正向生成在分支节点需要复杂前瞻，而反向生成通常是确定性的，这一特性为NAR模型提供了优势。

Result: AR和NAR模型均能实现完美准确率，但NAR模型需要指数级更少的训练样本和更浅的架构；AR模型常需特定课程学习调整才能收敛。机制分析表明NAR模型通过利用未来token进行反向解码，完全避开了复杂遍历机制的学习。

Conclusion: NAR模型为规划任务提供了更高效的解决方案，其通过反向解码机制充分利用了规划问题的内在不对称性，相比AR模型在学习效率和架构需求方面具有显著优势，为设计高效规划模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: While Autoregressive (AR) Transformer-based Generative Language Models are frequently employed for lookahead tasks, recent research suggests a potential discrepancy in their ability to perform planning tasks that require multi-step lookahead. In this work, we investigate the distinct emergent mechanisms that arise when training AR versus Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models, such as Discrete Diffusion Models (dLLMs), on lookahead tasks. By requiring the models to plan ahead to reach the correct conclusion, we analyze how these two paradigms fundamentally differ in their approach to the problem. We identify a critical asymmetry in planning problems: while forward generation requires complex lookahead at branching junctions, reverse generation is often deterministic. This asymmetry creates an opportunity for NAR models. Through mechanistic analysis of training and inference dynamics, we demonstrate that NAR models learn to solve planning tasks by utilizing future tokens to decode backwards, avoiding the need to learn complex traversal mechanisms entirely. Consequently, we report that both AR and NAR models are able to achieve perfect accuracy on the lookahead task. However, NAR models require exponentially fewer training examples and shallower architectures compared to AR models, which often fail to converge without specific curriculum adjustments.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range
  of computer vision tasks, but their practical deployment is limited by high
  computational and memory costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel tensor-based
  framework for Vision Transformers built upon the Tensor Cosine Product
  (Cproduct). By exploiting multilinear structures inherent in image data and the
  orthogonality of cosine transforms, the proposed approach enables efficient
  attention mechanisms and structured feature representations. We develop the
  theoretical foundations of the tensor cosine product, analyze its algebraic
  properties, and integrate it into a new Cproduct-based Vision Transformer
  architecture (TCP-ViT). Numerical experiments on standard classification and
  segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a uniform
  1/C parameter reduction (where C is the number of channels) while
  maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of time-to-event counterfactual survival prediction, aiming to optimize individualized survival outcomes in the presence of heterogeneity and censored data. We propose CURE, a framework that advances counterfactual survival modeling via comprehensive multimodal embedding and latent subgroup retrieval. CURE integrates clinical, paraclinical, demographic, and multi-omics information, which are aligned and fused through cross-attention mechanisms. Complex multi-omics signals can be adaptively refined using a mixture-of-experts architecture, emphasizing the most informative omics components. Building upon this representation, CURE implicitly retrieves patient-specific latent subgroups that capture both baseline survival dynamics and treatment-dependent variations. Experimental results on METABRIC and TCGA-LUAD datasets demonstrate that proposed CURE model consistently outperforms strong baselines in survival analysis, evaluated using the Time-dependent Concordance Index ($C^{td}$) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). These findings highlight the potential of CURE to enhance multimodal understanding and serve as a foundation for future treatment recommendation models.

### [115] [A Theory of How Pretraining Shapes Inductive Bias in Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20062)
*Nicolas Anguita,Francesco Locatello,Andrew M. Saxe,Marco Mondelli,Flavia Mancini,Samuel Lippl,Clementine Domine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework analyzing how neural network initialization affects feature learning during fine-tuning, identifying four distinct regimes and showing that smaller initialization in early layers enables better feature reuse and refinement for improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While feature learning is crucial in both pretraining and fine-tuning stages, there lacks an end-to-end theoretical understanding of how initialization choices impact the ability to reuse and refine features during fine-tuning.

Method: The authors develop an analytical theory of the pretraining-fine-tuning pipeline using diagonal linear networks, deriving exact expressions for generalization error as a function of initialization parameters and task statistics.

Result: The theory identifies four distinct fine-tuning regimes. Smaller initialization scale in earlier layers enables networks to both reuse and refine features, leading to superior generalization on fine-tuning tasks that rely on a subset of pretraining features. Validated empirically on CIFAR-100 with nonlinear networks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates analytically how data and network initialization interact to shape fine-tuning generalization, highlighting the importance of relative initialization scale across layers for enabling continued feature learning during fine-tuning.

Abstract: Pretraining and fine-tuning are central stages in modern machine learning systems. In practice, feature learning plays an important role across both stages: deep neural networks learn a broad range of useful features during pretraining and further refine those features during fine-tuning. However, an end-to-end theoretical understanding of how choices of initialization impact the ability to reuse and refine features during fine-tuning has remained elusive. Here we develop an analytical theory of the pretraining-fine-tuning pipeline in diagonal linear networks, deriving exact expressions for the generalization error as a function of initialization parameters and task statistics. We find that different initialization choices place the network into four distinct fine-tuning regimes that are distinguished by their ability to support feature learning and reuse, and therefore by the task statistics for which they are beneficial. In particular, a smaller initialization scale in earlier layers enables the network to both reuse and refine its features, leading to superior generalization on fine-tuning tasks that rely on a subset of pretraining features. We demonstrate empirically that the same initialization parameters impact generalization in nonlinear networks trained on CIFAR-100. Overall, our results demonstrate analytically how data and network initialization interact to shape fine-tuning generalization, highlighting an important role for the relative scale of initialization across different layers in enabling continued feature learning during fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究解决了对抗性注入模型中在线学习的根本性理论问题：证明了当VC维为1时，无分布算法的误差下界为Ω(√T)，与已知上界匹配，揭示了分布访问权限带来的本质优势。同时提出基于"鲁棒见证"的新算法框架，为半空间学习等任务提供了首个无分布依赖的误差界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究发现在线学习中存在显著的性能鸿沟：当算法能访问底层分布时，误差可达O(d² log T)（d为VC维）；而无分布算法仅对受限类别能达到Õ(√T)的误差。该论文旨在探究这一鸿沟是否根本存在，并为半空间等关键概念类寻找无分布依赖的有效算法。

Method: 1) 证明VC维为1时的Ω(√T)误差下界；2) 提出基于"鲁棒见证"的势函数框架，利用两类组合维度：推断维度和新引入的证书维度；3) 特别分析二维半空间的证书维度。

Result: 1) 建立了分布访问与无分布学习间的尖锐分离：下界与上界匹配；2) 推导出推断维度为k的概念类的Õ(T^{1-1/k})误差界；3) 发现二维半空间的证书维度为3，获得首个无分布依赖的Õ(T^{2/3})误差界。

Conclusion: 该工作确立了分布访问在对抗性注入模型中的根本重要性，提出的证书维度为分析复杂概念类的鲁棒学习提供了新工具，解决了半空间在无分布对抗学习中的关键开放问题，显著推进了对清洁标签对抗攻击的理解。

Abstract: We study online learning in the adversarial injection model introduced by [Goel et al. 2017], where a stream of labeled examples is predominantly drawn i.i.d.\ from an unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}$, but may be interspersed with adversarially chosen instances without the learner knowing which rounds are adversarial. Crucially, labels are always consistent with a fixed target concept (the clean-label setting). The learner is additionally allowed to abstain from predicting, and the total error counts the mistakes whenever the learner decides to predict and incorrect abstentions when it abstains on i.i.d.\ rounds. Perhaps surprisingly, prior work shows that oracle access to the underlying distribution yields $O(d^2 \log T)$ combined error for VC dimension $d$, while distribution-agnostic algorithms achieve only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ for restricted classes, leaving open whether this gap is fundamental.
  We resolve this question by proving a matching $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for VC dimension $1$, establishing a sharp separation between the two information regimes. On the algorithmic side, we introduce a potential-based framework driven by \emph{robust witnesses}, small subsets of labeled examples that certify predictions while remaining resilient to adversarial contamination. We instantiate this framework using two combinatorial dimensions: (1) \emph{inference dimension}, yielding combined error $\tilde{O}(T^{1-1/k})$ for classes of inference dimension $k$, and (2) \emph{certificate dimension}, a new relaxation we introduce. As an application, we show that halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^2$ have certificate dimension $3$, obtaining the first distribution-agnostic bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ for this class. This is notable since [Blum et al. 2021] showed halfspaces are not robustly learnable under clean-label attacks without abstention.

TL;DR: 提出一种分布无关的随机去掩码调度方法，通过自适应调整每轮揭示的标记数量，为扩散语言模型提供理论保证的并行采样加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散语言模型在经验上取得成功，但去掩码调度如何影响生成质量的理论理解仍然有限，特别是现有确定性方法缺乏适应性，无法根据目标数据分布的依赖结构进行优化

Method: 提出一种分布无关的随机去掩码调度，在每次迭代中随机化揭示的标记数量，无需先验知识或超参数调优，能自适应目标数据分布的未知依赖结构

Result: 证明了在并行采样机制(K<L)下，采样收敛保证按KL散度度量可分别达到Õ(TC/K)和Õ(DTC/K)，其中TC和DTC捕获了数据的内在依赖结构，显著优于先前理论，并为低复杂度分布提供实质性采样加速

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了DLM对内在数据结构的适应性，证明了随机化去掩码大小在设计推理调度中的优势，为扩散语言模型的理论和实践提供了重要洞见

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) approaches, enabling parallel token generation beyond a rigid left-to-right order. Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how unmasking schedules -- which specify the order and size of unmasked tokens during sampling -- affect generation quality remains limited. In this work, we introduce a distribution-agnostic unmasking schedule for DLMs that adapts to the (unknown) dependence structure of the target data distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge or hyperparameter tuning. In contrast to prior deterministic procedures that fix unmasking sizes, our method randomizes the number of tokens revealed at each iteration. We show that, for two specific parameter choices, the sampling convergence guarantees -- measured by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence -- scale as $\widetilde O(\mathsf{TC}/K)$ and $\widetilde O(\mathsf{DTC}/K)$ respectively. Here, $K$ is the number of iterations, and $\mathsf{TC}$ and $\mathsf{DTC}$ are the total correlation and dual total correlation of the target distribution, capturing the intrinsic dependence structure underlying the data. Importantly, our guarantees hold in the practically relevant parallel-sampling regime $K<L$ where $L$ is the token sequence length. These results significantly improve upon prior convergence theories and yield substantial sampling acceleration for low-complexity distributions. Overall, our findings unveil the adaptivity of DLMs to intrinsic data structures and shed light on the benefit of randomized unmasking sizes in inference schedule design.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种仅通过监测单个系统可观测量来检测初始系统-环境相关性的新方法，无需全状态层析或多次制备，通过定义"因子化包络"实现相关性的实验认证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测系统-环境初始相关性的方法依赖全状态层析或多系统制备，实验成本高且不实用；需开发更简便可行的检测方案

Method: 针对已知相互作用（如各向同性海森堡交换），推导单可观测量(σ_z^S)信号的全因子化初始态边界，形成"因子化包络"；观测轨迹若超出该包络即证明确存在初始相关性

Result: 1) 建立普适性边界条件 2) 包络可解释为标准乘积嵌入映射的允许区域 3) 三组实例显示明显包络违反 4) 方法扩展至纯退相位自旋-玻色模型仍有效

Conclusion: 单次校准+单轴测量即可认证初始相关性，突破传统方法限制，为实验检测量子关联提供高效新范式

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting initial system--environment correlations when the environment is not directly accessible. Most existing approaches rely on full state tomography or multiple system preparations, which can be experimentally demanding.
  We show that, for a known interaction, it can be sufficient to monitor a single expectation value of the system. Focusing on a qubit interacting with an environment via isotropic Heisenberg exchange, we derive exact bounds on the signal $z(t)=\langleσ_z^S\rangle(t)$ that hold for all factorized initial states. These bounds define a \emph{factorized envelope}: if an observed trajectory exits this envelope at any time, initial system--environment correlations are certified.
  From a reduced-dynamics perspective, the envelope admits a clear operational interpretation as the admissible region generated by the standard product assignment (embedding) map, which serves as a null model for uncorrelated preparations. Envelope violations therefore rule out the entire product-assignment class using only a single calibrated observable.
  We illustrate the method using three families of correlated initial states and observe clear envelope violations, including cases in which the reduced system state is maximally mixed. We further show that the same single-observable logic extends to an exactly solvable pure-dephasing spin--boson model with an infinite environment, where factorized initial states generate a simple coherence envelope whose violation certifies initial correlations. Overall, our results demonstrate that single-axis measurements, combined with a one-time calibration of $ρ_S(0)$, can certify initial system--environment correlations without tomography or environment access.

Conclusion: 提出连续测量方案下的最佳解耦条件，可有效消除时间不确定性影响；该理论框架具有普适性，可推广至各类量子传感器系统

Abstract: High-sensitivity accelerometers and gravimeters, achieving the ultimate limits of measurement sensitivity are key tools for advancing both fundamental and applied physics. While numerous platforms have been proposed to achieve this goal, from atom interferometers to optomechanical systems, all of these studies neglect the effects of intrinsic quantum uncertainty in time estimation. Starting from the Hamiltonian of a generic linear quantum sensor, we derive the two-parameter quantum Fisher information matrix and establish the corresponding Cram'er-Rao bound, treating time as an uncertain (nuisance) parameter. Our analysis reveals a fundamental coupling between time and signal estimation that inherently degrades measurement sensitivity, with the standard single-parameter quantum limit recovered only at specific interrogation times or under special decoupling conditions. We then apply these results to an optomechanical gravimeter and explicitly derive an optimal decoupling condition under which the effects of time uncertainty are averaged out in a continuous measurement scheme. Our approach is general and can be readily extended to a broad class of quantum sensors.

Abstract: Understanding emergent phenomena in out-of-equilibrium interacting many-body systems is an exciting frontier in physical science. While quantum simulators represent a promising approach to this long-standing problem, in practice it can be challenging to directly realize the required interactions, measure arbitrary observables, and mitigate errors. Here we use coherent mapping between the Rydberg and hyperfine qubits in a neutral atom array simulator to engineer and probe complex quantum dynamics. We combine efficient analog dynamics with fully programmable state preparation and measurement, leverage non-destructive readout for loss information and atomic qubit reuse, and use an atom reservoir for replacing lost atoms. With this analog-digital approach, we first demonstrate dynamical engineering of ring-exchange and particle hopping dynamics via Floquet driving and measure the spectral function of single excitations by evolving initial superposition states. Extending these techniques to a 271-site kagome lattice, we employ closed-loop optimization to target an out-of-equilibrium critical quantum spin liquid of the Rokhsar-Kivelson type. We observe the key features of such a state, including the absence of local order, many-body coherences between nearly equal-amplitude dimer configurations over up to 18 sites, and universal correlations consistent with predictions from field theory. Together, these results pave the way for using dynamical control in analog-digital quantum simulators to study complex quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Symmetry constraints provide a powerful means to control the dynamics of open quantum systems. However, the set of accessible control parameters is often limited. Here, we show that a tunable phase in the collective light-matter coupling of a cavity QED system induces a phase-dependent strong symmetry of the Liouvillian, enabling dynamical control of the open quantum system evolution. We demonstrate that tuning this phase substantially reduces the critical driving strength for dissipative phase transitions between stationary and non-stationary phases. We illustrate this mechanism in two experimentally relevant cavity QED settings: a two-species ensemble of two-level atoms and a single-species ensemble of three-level atoms. Our results establish phase control as a versatile tool for engineering dissipative phase transitions, with implications for quantum state preparation.

Method: 通过三种轨道变换策略分析Trotter误差：(1)先验选择低误差轨道基组；(2)推导无Trotter误差的基组(利用误差在Givens旋转参数下的连续性)；(3)Trotter步骤间应用改变计算基的传播子；结合数值实验验证

Result: 数值结果表明：(1)局域轨道基组在分子计算中未产生大Trotter误差，推翻文献结论；(2)可靠降低Trotter误差的轨道变换具有挑战性，难以建立通用优化方案

Conclusion: 局域轨道适用于高效量子相位估计设置，但轨道变换降低Trotter误差的普适方法尚未找到，需进一步研究误差抑制的系统性策略

Abstract: Quantum computation with Trotter product formulae is straightforward and requires little overhead in terms of logical qubits. The choice of the orbital basis significantly affects circuit depth, with localised orbitals yielding lowest circuit depths. However, literature results point to large Trotter errors incurred by localised orbitals. Here, we therefore investigate the effect of orbital transformations on Trotter error. We consider three strategies to reduce Trotter error by orbital transformation: (i) The a priori selection of an orbital basis that produces low Trotter error. (ii) The derivation of an orbital basis that produces a ground state energy free of Trotter error (as we observed that the Trotter error is a continuous function in the Givens-rotation parameter, from which continuity of this error upon orbital transformation can be deduced). (iii) Application of propagators that change the computational basis between Trotter steps. Our numerical results show that reliably reducing Trotter error by orbital transformations is challenging. General recipes to produce low Trotter errors cannot be easily derived, despite analytical expressions which suggest ways to decrease Trotter error. Importantly, we found that localised orbital bases do not produce large Trotter errors in molecular calculations, which is an important result for efficient QPE set-ups.

Conclusion: 该范畴论框架成功捕捉了高阶量子理论的主要特征，且嵌入结果表明强profunctor理论可作为高阶电路的通用模型。

Abstract: We write down a series of basic laws for (strict) higher-order circuit diagrams. More precisely, we define higher-order circuit theories in terms of: (a) nesting, (b) temporal and spatial composition, and (c) equivalence between lower-order bipartite processes and higher-order bipartite states. In category-theoretic terms, these laws are expressed using enrichment and cotensors in symmetric polycategories, along with a frobenius-like coherence between them. We describe how these laws capture the salient features of higher-order quantum theory, and discover an upper bound for higher-order circuits: any higher-order circuit theory embeds into the theory of strong profunctors.

Abstract: We develop a thermodynamic characterization of multimode entanglement in pure continuous-variable systems by quantifying the gap between globally and locally extractable work (ergotropy). For arbitrary pure multimode Gaussian states, we prove that the $2$-local ergotropic gap is a faithful entanglement monotone across any bipartition and constitutes a functionally independent upper bound to the Renyi-2 entanglement entropy. We further introduce the $k$-ergotropic score, the minimum $k$-local ergotropic gap, and show that it faithfully quantifies multimode entanglement across $k$ partitions. For pure three-mode Gaussian states, we derive its closed-form relation with the geometric measure for genuine multimode entanglement $(k=2)$, and total Gaussian multimode entanglement $(k=3)$. For systems with more than three modes, the $k$-ergotropic score becomes a functionally independent measure of multimode entanglement to the standard geometric measures. Our results reveal a direct operational hierarchy linking Gaussian multimode entanglement to work extraction under locality constraints, and provide a computable and experimentally accessible thermodynamic framework for characterizing quantum correlations.

Abstract: We investigate the decomposition of ergotropy into incoherent and coherent contributions for quantum systems subject to typical Markovian noise channels. The incoherent part originates from population inversion in the energy eigenbasis after dephasing, while the coherent part captures the role of quantum coherence in work extraction. For single-qubit systems, we derive explicit conditions for freezing and enhancement of coherent ergotropy and obtain an analytical upper bound, showing that it cannot exceed one half of the state's quantum coherence. We then study two classes of separable two-qubit states under local noise. For Bell-diagonal states, which are locally completely passive and possess no local coherence, we prove that the total extractable work equals the average of geometric quantum and classical correlations. In this case, coherent ergotropy cannot be enhanced, although freezing occurs under specific noise conditions. By contrast, for separable states with local coherence, coherent ergotropy can increase under all considered noise channels, including phase-flip and depolarizing noise. Extending the analysis to multipartite systems, we show that both the magnitude and range of noise-induced enhancement grow with the number of qubits, indicating collective reinforcement. Finally, we demonstrate through an explicit example that entanglement does not prevent this enhancement: coherent ergotropy may increase under noise even for entangled states. Our results reveal that noise can assist energy storage, challenging the conventional view of noise as purely detrimental and suggesting compatibility between noise-assisted enhancement and fast entanglement-based charging mechanisms in quantum batteries.

Abstract: Both in quantum theory and in general probabilistic theories, measurements with $n$ outcomes are modelled as $n$-tuples of \emph{effects} summing up to the unit effect. Why is this the case, and can this assumption be meaningfully relaxed? Here we develop \emph{generalized measurement theories (GMTs)} as a mathematical framework for physical theories that is complementary to general probabilistic theories, and where this kind of question can be made precise and answered. We then give a definition of \emph{probabilistic state} on a GMT, prove that measurements are made of effects in every GMT in which the probabilistic states separate the measurements, and also argue that this separation condition is physically well-motivated. Finally, we also discuss when a GMT should be considered classical and characterize GMTs corresponding to Boolean algebras as those that are strongly classical and projective.

Abstract: We consider physical Hamiltonians that can be represented by the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles, theoretically derive the state ensembles for its eigenstates and analyze the effect of varying system conditions on its bipartite entanglement entropy. Our approach leads to a single parametric based common mathematical formulation for the evolution of the entanglement statistics of different states of a given Hamiltonian or different Hamiltonians subjected to same symmetry constraints. The parameter turns out to be a single functional of the system parameters and thereby reveals a deep web of connection hidden underneath different quantum states.

Conclusion: 该协议有效解决集成化器件中的频率转换瓶颈，可应用于量子密钥分发等量子信息处理领域，推动光子源与探测器的高效集成。

Abstract: In this letter we explore how full frequency conversion can be performed in shorter, integrable devices by using a STIRAP-like protocol modified by the time rescaling shortcut to adiabaticity. We show how the coupled equations for two simultaneous three-wave mixing processes can be written in terms of a STIRAP-like system, which creates robust conversion, albeit requiring long propagation distances inside a bulk crystal or waveguide. We then discuss how the time rescaling (TR) method can be modified to be applied in optical systems, then apply it in the conversion process to create a TR-STIRAP protocol, showing that full conversion is also obtained, but at a fraction of the propagation distance. We also show how the original shaping of the coupling coefficients required by the TR-STIRAP can be approximated by gaussian functions with high conversion fidelity, thus simplifying the experimental implementation. This protocol has the potential to be used in several areas, including the integration of photon sources and efficient detectors for quantum key distribution.

Abstract: We analyze a time-continuous version of a cellular automaton decoder for the toric code in the form of a Lindblad master equation. In this setting, a self-correcting quantum memory becomes a thermodynamical phase of the steady state, which manifests itself through the steady state being topologically ordered. We compute the steady state phase diagram, finding a competition between the error correction rate and the update rate for the classical field of the cellular automaton. Strikingly, we find that self-correction of errors is possible even in situations where conventional quantum error correction does not have a finite threshold.

Abstract: The nonstabilizerness of quantum states is a necessary resource for universal quantum computation, yet its characterization is notoriously demanding. Quantifying nonstabilizerness typically requires an exponential number of measurements and a doubly exponential classical post-processing cost to evaluate its standard monotones. In this work, we show that nonstabilizerness is, to a large extent, in the eyes of the beholder: it can be witnessed and quantified using any set of $m$ $n$-qubit Pauli measurements, provided the set contains anti-commuting pairs. We introduce a general framework that projects the stabilizer polytope onto the subspace defined by these observables and provide an algorithm that estimates magic from Pauli expectation values with runtime exponential in the number of measurements $m$ and polynomial in the number of qubits $n$. By relating the problem to a stabilizer-restricted variant of the quantum marginal problem, we also prove that deciding membership in the corresponding reduced stabilizer polytope is NP-hard. In particular, unless $\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{NP}$, no algorithm polynomial in $m$ can solve the problem in full generality, thus establishing fundamental complexity-theoretic limitations. Finally, we employ our framework to compute nonstabilizerness in different Hamiltonian ground states, demonstrating the practical performance of our method in regimes beyond the reach of existing techniques.

Abstract: Achieving superradiant lasing with an ultranarrow linewidth is crucial for enhancing atomic clock stability in quantum precision measurement. By employing the exceptional point (EP) property of the system, we demonstrate theoretically superradiant lasing with linewidths in the $μ$Hz range, sustained at the high-power level. This is achieved by incoherently pumping optical lattice clock transitions with ultracold alkaline-earth strontium-87 atoms in the EP of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system. Physically, the atomic coherence reaches a maximum in the EP, significantly amplifying the superradiance effect and resulting in superradiant lasing with an ultranarrow linewidth. This linewidth is even three orders of magnitude smaller than that of superradiant lasing in the systems without EP. Our work extends the realm of superradiant lasing by introducing the EP property, and offers promising applications for developing atomic clocks with exceptional stability and accuracy.

Motivation: 为高维和量子多体系统中的量子Fisher信息(QFI)计算提供高效框架，通过Krylov分布控制截断误差，并理解QFI在算子空间的分布特性。

Method: 将QFI表达为与密度矩阵相关的超算符$\mathcal{K}_ρ$的预解矩，引入Krylov分布概念，并运用正交多项式理论分析收敛行为。

Result: 识别出两种普适收敛机制：当Liouville空间谱与零有能隙时呈指数衰减；当小特征值在零附近聚集时服从硬边(Bessel)普适性的代数衰减。

Conclusion: 建立了量子计量学、谱几何与Krylov动力学之间的直接联系，为高维系统提供了概念洞察和实用计算工具。

Abstract: We develop a spectral-resolvent framework for computing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) using Krylov subspace methods, extending the notion of the Krylov distribution. By expressing the QFI as a resolvent moment of the superoperator $\mathcal{K}_ρ$ associated with a density matrix, the Krylov distribution quantifies how the QFI weight is distributed across Krylov levels in operator space and provides a natural measure for controlling the truncation error in Krylov approximations. Leveraging orthogonal polynomial theory, we identify two universal convergence regimes: exponential decay when the Liouville-space spectrum is gapped away from zero, and algebraic decay governed by hard-edge (Bessel) universality when small eigenvalues accumulate near zero. This framework establishes a direct connection between quantum metrology, spectral geometry, and Krylov dynamics, offering both conceptual insight and practical tools for efficient QFI computation in high-dimensional and many-body systems.

Conclusion: 需要代码、解码器与逻辑解耦组的协同设计，阐明了混合LDD+QEC协议具有优势的具体条件。

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) and dynamical decoupling (DD) are tools for protecting quantum information. A natural goal is to combine them to outperform either approach alone. Such a benefit is not automatic: physical DD can conflict with an encoded subspace, and QEC performance is governed by the errors that survive decoding, not necessarily those DD suppresses. We analyze a hybrid memory cycle where DD is implemented logically (LDD) using normalizer elements of an $[[n,k,d]]$ stabilizer code, followed by a round of syndrome measurement and recovery (or, in the detection setting, postselection on a trivial syndrome). In an effective Pauli model with physical error probability $p$, LDD suppression factor $p_{DD}$, and recovery imperfection rate $p_{QEC}$ (or $p_{QED}$), we derive closed-form entanglement-fidelity expressions for QEC-only, LDD-only, physical DD, and the hybrid LDD+QEC protocol. The formulas are expressed via a small set of code-dependent weight enumerator polynomials, making the role of the decoder and the LDD group explicit. For ideal recovery LDD+QEC outperforms QEC-only iff the conditional fraction of uncorrectable Pauli errors is larger in the LDD-suppressed sector than in the unsuppressed sector. In the low-noise regime, a sufficient design rule guaranteeing hybrid advantage is that LDD suppresses at least one minimum-weight uncorrectable Pauli error for the chosen recovery map. We show how stabilizer-equivalent choices of LDD generators can be used to enforce this condition. We supplement our analysis with numerical results for the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code and a $[[13,1,3]]$ code, mapping regions of hybrid-protocol advantage in parameter space beyond the small-$p$ regime. Our work illustrates the need for co-design of the code, decoder, and logical decoupling group, and clarifies the conditions under which the hybrid LDD+QEC protocol is advantageous.

Abstract: Directional codes, recently introduced by Gehér--Byfield--Ruban \cite{Geher2025Directional}, constitute a hardware-motivated family of quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. These codes are defined by stabilizers measured by ancilla qubits executing a fixed \emph{direction word} (route) on square- or hex-grid connectivity. In this work, we develop a comprehensive \emph{word-first} analysis framework for route-generated, translation-invariant CSS codes on rectangular tori. Under this framework, a direction word $W$ deterministically induces a finite support pattern $P(W)$, from which we analytically derive: (i)~a closed-form route-to-support map; (ii)~the odd-multiplicity difference lattice $L(W)$ that classifies commutation-compatible $X/Z$ layouts; and (iii)~conservative finite-torus admissibility criteria. Furthermore, we provide: (iv)~a rigorous word equivalence and canonicalization theory (incorporating dihedral lattice symmetries, reversal/inversion, and cyclic shifts) to enable symmetry-quotiented searches; (v)~an ``inverse problem'' criterion to determine when a translation-invariant support pattern is realizable by a single route, including reconstruction and non-realizability certificates; and (vi)~a quasi-cyclic (group-algebra) reduction for row-periodic layouts that explains the sensitivity of code dimension $k$ to boundary conditions. As a case study, we analyze the word $W=\texttt{NE$^2$NE$^2$N}$ end-to-end. We provide explicit stabilizer dependencies, commuting-operator motifs, and an exact criterion for dimension collapse on thin rectangles: for $(L_x, L_y) = (2d, d)$ with row alternation, we find $k=4$ if $6 \mid d$, and $k=0$ otherwise.

*Ben T. McDonough,Jian-Hao Zhang,Victor V. Albert,Andrew Lucas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper generalizes CSS quantum error-correcting codes to group-valued qudits for any finite group G, creating a unified framework that recovers qubit CSS codes for G=ℤ₂ and extends Kitaev's quantum double model. The authors define CSS-like codes where X-checks perform group multiplication and Z-checks solve group word equations, analyze them on 2D CW complexes, prove reduction theorems for non-Abelian simple groups, obtain distance bounds from graph structure, and construct asymptotically optimal codes while connecting to non-invertible symmetry-protected topological states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the well-established qubit CSS codes and Kitaev's quantum double model to arbitrary finite groups, enabling new families of quantum error-correcting codes with enhanced properties (like optimal rate/distance) and establishing connections to non-Abelian topological order and non-invertible symmetries in physics.

Method: The authors define G-valued qudit CSS-like codes where X-checks correspond to left/right group multiplication and Z-checks project onto solutions of group word equations. They analyze these codes on oriented 2D CW complexes, prove reduction theorems for non-Abelian simple groups with bounded Z-check weight/distance, derive distance bounds from the underlying graph structure, construct explicit code families with optimal parameters, and introduce "ghost vertices" to generalize models with defects and boundaries.

Result: 1) Framework for CSS-like codes on any finite group G that reduces to standard CSS codes for G=ℤ₂
2) Proof that suitable G-covariant codes reduce to CW quantum doubles for non-Abelian simple G
3) Logical operators and codespace structure analogous to surface codes
4) Distance bounds derived from CW complex graph properties
5) Explicit constructions of intrinsically non-Abelian codes with asymptotically optimal rate and distance
6) Generalization to quantum double models with defects via ghost vertices
7) Identification of non-invertible symmetry-protected topological states as codewords

Conclusion: The work successfully extends CSS codes and quantum double models to arbitrary finite groups, providing a powerful new framework for quantum error correction. The construction yields intrinsically non-Abelian codes with optimal parameters, establishes deep connections between quantum codes, topological order, and non-invertible symmetries, and opens new directions for topological quantum computation using non-Abelian anyons and group-theoretic structures.

Abstract: Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a versatile quantum error-correcting family built out of commuting $X$- and $Z$-type checks. We introduce CSS-like codes on $G$-valued qudits for any finite group $G$ that reduce to qubit CSS codes for $G = \mathbb{Z}_2$ yet generalize the Kitaev quantum double model for general groups. The $X$-checks of our group-CSS codes correspond to left and/or right multiplication by group elements, while $Z$-checks project onto solutions to group word equations. We describe quantum-double models on oriented two-dimensional CW complexes (which need not cellulate a manifold) and prove that, when $G$ is non-Abelian and simple, every $G$-covariant group-CSS code with suitably upper-bounded $Z$-check weight and lower-bounded $Z$-distance reduces to a CW quantum double. We describe the codespace and logical operators of CW quantum doubles via the same intuition used to obtain logical structure of surface codes. We obtain distance bounds for codes on non-Abelian simple groups from the graph underlying the CW complex, and construct intrinsically non-Abelian code families with asymptotically optimal rate and distances. Adding "ghost vertices" to the CW complex generalizes quantum double models with defects and rough boundary conditions whose logical structure can be understood without reference to non-Abelian anyons or defects. Several non-invertible symmetry-protected topological states, both with ordinary and higher-form symmetries, are the unique codewords of simply-connected CW quantum doubles with a single ghost vertex.

Abstract: In this work, the entanglement generation between two hexagonal-lattice layers embedded in a microcavity is studied, accounting for both electromagnetic coupling and intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Utilizing a short-time dynamical approach, we perform a perturbative Taylor expansion of the reduced density matrix to characterize the bipartite quantum correlations between the hexagonal layers. We demonstrate that the system undergoes a rapid transition from a localized product state in the conduction bands at t = 0 to a coherent superposition of valence and conduction band states. Our results indicate that the degree of entanglement is highly sensitive to the interlayer photon propagator, which contains the geometric ratios of the layer positions and the height cavity, and the specific Fermi energy and SOI signatures of the respective layers. We show the emergence of spacelike-separated quantum correlations in the ultra-short evolution regime, suggesting that heterostructures in cavities may be suitable to develop experiments for a deep understanding of spacelike-separated quantum effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推广Kitaev的Z_p拓扑码至素数维度量子比特系统，通过增强稳定子结构（每稳定子增加两个量子比特）并引入扭曲边界条件，探索更高性能的量子低密度奇偶校验码（qLDPC），以突破有限尺寸下的性能极限。

Method: 1. 采用Laurent多项式形式化描述系统；2. 适配Gröbner基算法高效计算逻辑维度k（避免构造大型奇偶校验矩阵）；3. 对p∈{3,5,7,11}在方格晶格上系统搜索不同稳定子构型和晶格几何。

Result: 1. 发现最优qLDPC码实例：$[[242,10,22]]_3$和$[[120,6,20]]_{11}$，均实现$k d^{2}/n=20$；2. 观测到固定n时最佳$k d^{2}$随p增大而提升，满足经验公式$k d^{2} = 0.0541 \, n^{2}\ln p + 3.84 \, n$，与Bravyi-Poulin-Terhal型权衡一致。

Conclusion: 通过增强稳定子结构与优化晶格几何，素数维度CSS码可实现接近最优的kd²/n性能；Gröbner基方法显著提升逻辑维度计算效率；观测到的kd²~n²ln p关系为有限尺寸量子码设计提供了新标度律，对高维量子纠错码构造具有指导意义。

Abstract: We study two-dimensional translation-invariant CSS stabilizer codes over prime-dimensional qudits on the square lattice under twisted boundary conditions, generalizing the Kitaev $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code by augmenting each stabilizer with two additional qudits. Using the Laurent-polynomial formalism, we adapt the Gröbner basis to compute the logical dimension $k$ efficiently, without explicitly constructing large parity-check matrices. We then perform a systematic search over various stabilizer realizations and lattice geometries for $p\in\{3,5,7,11\}$, identifying qudit low-density parity-check codes with the optimal finite-size performance. Representative examples include $[[242,10,22]]_3$ and $[[120,6,20]]_{11}$, both achieving $k d^{2}/n=20$. Across the searched regime, the best observed $k d^{2}$ at fixed $n$ increases with $p$, with an empirical relation $k d^{2} = 0.0541 \, n^{2}\ln p + 3.84 \, n$, compatible with a Bravyi--Poulin--Terhal-type tradeoff when the interaction range grows with system size.

Abstract: Controlled unitary gates are a basic element in many quantum algorithms. Converting a general unitary $U$ with a known decomposition into its controlled version, controlled-$U$, can introduce a large overhead in terms of the depth of the circuit. We present a general method to take any unitary $U$ into controlled-$U$ using a fixed circuit with 4 CNOT gates and 2 Toffoli gates per qubit. For $n$-qubit unitaries and one control qubit, we require $2n+1$ qubits and a circuit that can generate an eigenstate of $U$, for which there are many cost-effective known algorithms. The method also works for any black block implementation of $U$, achieving a constant-depth realization independent of its decomposition. We illustrate its use in the Hadamard test and discuss applications to variational and quantum machine-learning algorithms.

TL;DR: 该论文证明了量子草图模型下的近似最近邻搜索需要Ω(n)量子比特存储，排除了O(log n)量子比特压缩的可能性，同时揭示振幅放大在候选扫描中可实现平方级加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Johnson-Lindenstrauss降维、振幅编码以及测量作为哈希原语的启发，研究者曾期望将n点近似最近邻数据结构压缩至O(log n)量子比特，本文旨在检验这一可能性在量子计算模型下的可行性。

Method: 通过将量子ANN草图问题规约到量子随机访问编码和Nayak下界理论，在汉明空间{0,1}^d（其中d=Θ(log n)）中构造n点实例，证明对于任意近似因子c≥1和常数成功概率p>1/2，任何量子草图都需要m=Ω(n)量子比特。

Result: 在量子草图模型中，对于任意近似因子和常数成功概率，近似最近邻搜索的量子态编码需要线性数量级的量子比特存储空间，即m=Ω(n)，无法实现O(log n)的压缩目标。

Conclusion: 量子近似最近邻搜索存在固有的内存下界，必须使用线性空间。尽管量子振幅放大在候选点扫描中可实现最优的平方级查询加速，但这种加速受Grover/BBBV下界限制，无法突破基本计算极限。

Abstract: Motivated by Johnson--Lindenstrauss dimension reduction, amplitude encoding, and the view of measurements as hash-like primitives, one might hope to compress an $n$-point approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) data structure into $O(\log n)$ qubits. We rule out this possibility in a broad quantum sketch model, the dataset $P$ is encoded as an $m$-qubit state $ρ_P$, and each query is answered by an arbitrary query-dependent measurement on a fresh copy of $ρ_P$. For every approximation factor $c\ge 1$ and constant success probability $p>1/2$, we exhibit $n$-point instances in Hamming space $\{0,1\}^d$ with $d=Θ(\log n)$ for which any such sketch requires $m=Ω(n)$ qubits, via a reduction to quantum random access codes and Nayak's lower bound. These memory lower bounds coexist with potential quantum query-time gains and in candidate-scanning abstractions of hashing-based ANN, amplitude amplification yields a quadratic reduction in candidate checks, which is essentially optimal by Grover/BBBV-type bounds.

TL;DR: Two gravitationally interacting Stern-Gerlach interferometers exhibit mass-independent entanglement phase, with imperfect recombination revealing mesoscopic mass constraints for quantum gravity experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe quantum gravitational effects by analytically modeling entanglement dynamics between two massive Stern-Gerlach interferometers, addressing challenges in testing quantum gravity at mesoscopic scales.

Method: Analytical solution of unitary/open quantum dynamics for two coupled interferometers using operator-valued forces and gravitational interaction, incorporating diffusion/dephasing noise with squeezed thermal states.

Result: The gravitational entanglement phase is mass-independent (unitary/open dynamics, any temperature/squeezing); imperfect center-of-mass recombination reveals second-order mass-dependent effects that bound achievable masses to mesoscopic regimes, with noise tightening experimental limits.

Conclusion: This framework provides testable predictions for quantum gravity experiments using diamagnetically levitated NV-center masses, defining viable mass ranges and sensitivity requirements under realistic noise.

Abstract: We analytically solve the entangling quantum dynamics of two interacting Stern-Gerlach Interferometers~(SGI). Each SGI exploits an operator-valued force applied by a qubit to create and recombine a non-Gaussian state of matter. The entangling phase between the two qubits generated by the leading-order gravitational interaction of the massive degrees of freedom is found to be mass-independent, both for unitary and open dynamics, irrespective of the temperature and squeezing of the initial states. Further, we show that the solution of the four interferometric paths reveals that the mere presence of the interaction does not allow for a perfect recombination of the centre of mass. This second-order effect, alongside higher-order interaction terms, can be used to bound the mass from above and below, thus restricting the experiment's regime to mesoscopic masses. By solving the open dynamics which includes diffusion and dephasing with initial squeezed thermal states, the bounds are tightened by the inclusion of realistic experimental noise. We discuss diamagnetic levitated masses with embedded NV-centres as a specific physical implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GPSL模型中因涂抹函数相同导致的加热率发散问题，并探索通过区分测量和引力反馈的涂抹尺度来最小化自发热的可能性。

Method: 推广模型至一般情况，使用任意空间涂抹函数gr_C(x)和gr_G(x)（特征长度尺度r_C和r_G），计算自发热率，并分析最小化自发热的最优涂抹轮廓。

Result: 发现允许gr_G(x) ≠ gr_C(x)时，反馈诱导的自发热可降低超过60个数量级（例如r_G = 10 r_C）；基于中子星温度、半径和质量数据，设定了模型参数的新下限。

Conclusion: 通过区分涂抹函数，GPSL模型的自发热问题得到显著缓解，增强了其在 astrophysical 场景（如中子星）中的适用性，并为模型提供了观测约束。

Abstract: The Gravitational Poissonian Spontaneous Localization (GPSL) model is a hybrid classical-quantum framework in which Newtonian gravity emerges from stochastic collapses of a smeared mass-density operator. Consistency of the hybrid dynamics entails momentum diffusion and, hence, spontaneous heating. Without smearing, which enters both the collapse (measurement) and gravitational-feedback components of the dynamics, the heating rate would be divergent. Previous work assumed identical smearings for both components. Here, we treat the general case of distinct spatial smearings $g_{r_C} (\mathbf{x})$ and $g_{r_G} (\mathbf{x})$, characterized, respectively, by length scales $r_C$ and $r_G$. We characterize the spontaneous heating rate for arbitrary $g_{r_C} (\mathbf{x})$ and $g_{r_G} (\mathbf{x})$, and then discuss which smearing profiles minimize the spontaneous heating rate in relevant physical situations. Remarkably, there are situations in which, while the measurement noise remains the same, allowing $g_{r_G} (\mathbf{x}) \neq g_{r_C} (\mathbf{x})$ may reduce the feedback-induced spontaneous heating by more than 60 orders of magnitude already for $r_G = 10 r_C$. Finally, we use our results to estimate the spontaneous heating rate of neutron stars and to set new lower bounds on the model's parameters by comparing the theoretical predictions with astronomical data on temperature, radius, and mass of neutron stars.

Abstract: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) constitute a central building block of near-term quantum machine learning (QML), yet the principled design of expressive and trainable architectures remains a major open challenge. The VQC design space grows combinatorially with the number of qubits, layers, entanglement structures, and gate parameterizations, rendering manual circuit construction inefficient and often suboptimal. We introduce an autonomous agent-based framework for VQC architecture search that integrates high-level reasoning with a quantum simulation environment. The agent proposes candidate circuit architectures, evaluates them through fully automated training and validation pipelines, and iteratively improves its design strategy via performance-driven feedback. Empirically, we show that the agent autonomously evolves circuit architectures from simple initial ansätze toward increasingly expressive designs, progressively trying to improve task performance. This demonstrates that agentic AI can effectively navigate and refine the VQC design landscape with minimal human intervention, providing a scalable methodology for automated quantum model development in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) regime.

### [146] [Contextuality-enhanced quantum state discrimination under fixed failure probability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19397)
*Min Namkung,Hyang-Tag Lim*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper theoretically demonstrates that contextuality enhancement in quantum state discrimination disappears within certain intermediate failure probability ranges, revealing a phenomenon absent in conventional strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum state discrimination has non-classical advantages but practical implementations involve both error and failure outcomes, requiring a unified strategy that explores contextuality enhancement under realistic conditions.

Method: Theoretical analysis of contextuality enhancement in quantum state discrimination under fixed failure probability constraints, examining its dependence on state confusability (fidelity) and extending to noisy scenarios.

Result: Discovery of a non-enhancement region where contextuality advantages disappear at intermediate failure probabilities, contrasting with conventional strategies that always outperform noncontextual bounds. This region diminishes with increased noise.

Conclusion: The existence and characteristics of the non-enhancement region depend on quantum state confusability, and contextuality advantages in discrimination are sensitive to noise conditions, providing insights for quantum sensing and communication applications.

Abstract: Quantum state discrimination enables the accurate identification of quantum states, which are generally nonorthogonal. Among various strategies, minimum-error discrimination and unambiguous state discrimination exhibit contextuality-enhanced success probabilities that surpass classical bounds, offering significant advantages for quantum sensing and communication. However, in practice, both error and failure outcomes can occur, suggesting the need for a unified strategy that incorporates both aspects while exploring the potential for contextuality enhancement. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate contextuality enhancement in quantum state discrimination under a fixed failure probability. We show that this enhancement disappears within a certain intermediate range of failure probabilities--a phenomenon absent in conventional strategies, where both minimum-error and unambiguous discrimination consistently outperform the noncontextual bound for equal priors. Moreover, we analyze how the existence of this non-enhancement region depends on the confusability of the quantum states, which corresponds to their fidelity in a quantum model. We further extend the discussion to the noisy state discrimination, which even encompasses the maximal-confidence discrimination. In this extended discussion, we observe that the non-enhancement region tends to disappear with increasing noise strength.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在噪声量子硬件上制备高保真GHZ态面临累积门错误和退相干的挑战，传统方法错误率高且难以扩展到大规模量子系统，亟需一种能够抑制错误传播并适用于任意拓扑结构的新型协议。

Method: Group-MV协议将任意耦合图分割为子图，并行制备局部GHZ态，通过多数表决机制对边界链路的中期测量结果进行冗余纠错，利用经典前馈融合子图态，从而抑制测量错误在电路中的传播。

Result: 在Heavy-hex和Grid拓扑结构上模拟30-60量子比特的噪声环境，Group-MV比Line Dynamic方法保真度提升2.4倍，与理想幺正演化基线差距在3%以内，且可推广至任意尺寸GHZ态和任意耦合拓扑。

Conclusion: Group-MV是一种通用且高效的GHZ态制备协议，显著提升噪声量子硬件上的态保真度，为大规模量子计算和量子纠错提供了实用化路径。

Abstract: Preparing high-fidelity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states on noisy quantum hardware remains challenging due to cumulative gate errors and decoherence. We introduce Group-Majority-Voting (Group-MV), a dynamic-circuit protocol that partitions arbitrary coupling graphs, prepares local GHZ states in parallel, and fuses them via majority-voted mid-circuit measurements. The majority vote over redundant boundary links mitigates measurement errors that would otherwise propagate through classical feedforward. We evaluate Group-MV on simulated Heavy-hex and Grid topologies for 30 through 60 qubits under a realistic noise regime. Group-MV generalizes to arbitrary GHZ sizes on arbitrary coupling topologies, achieving 2.4x higher fidelity than the Line Dynamic method while tracking the unitary baseline within 3%.

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了希尔伯特空间的基本尺度不变对称性，为通过子系统和条件交叉熵基准测试验证量子计算机提供了严格的可扩展框架，对量子信息理论和量子计算验证具有重要意义。

Abstract: We analytically derive the bit-string probability distributions of subsystems of random pure states and depolarized random states using the Dirichlet distribution. We identify the exact Beta distribution as the universal statistical law of random quantum states, providing a unified finite-size description of full-system, subsystem, and conditional statistics. In the presence of depolarizing noise, these distributions are scaled and shifted by the noise strength, producing a noise-induced gap in their support. Remarkably, we prove that random states exhibit exact conditional self-similarity: the distribution of subsystem bit-string probabilities conditioned on specific outcomes of the complementary subsystem is identical to that of the full system. This hidden scale invariance enables the exact restoration of the full-system statistics from the marginalized Beta distribution via post-selection, and persists under depolarizing noise. Our results uncover a fundamental symmetry of Hilbert space and provide a scalable, rigorous framework for validating random circuit sampling via subsystem or conditional cross-entropy benchmarking.

Abstract: The deterministic preparation of quantum many-body ground states is essential for advanced quantum simulation, yet optimal algorithms often require prohibitive hardware resources. Here, we propose a highly efficient, non-variational protocol for ground state preparation using a Power-Cosine quantum signal processing (QSP) filter. By eschewing complex block-encoding techniques, our method directly utilizes coherent time-evolution operators controlled by a single ancillary qubit. The integration of mid-circuit measurement and reset (MCMR) drastically minimizes spatial overhead, translating iterative non-unitary filtering into deep temporal coherence. We analytically demonstrate that this approach achieves exponential suppression of excited states with a circuit depth scaling of $\mathcal{O}(Δ^{-2}\log(1/ε))$, prioritizing implementational simplicity over optimal asymptotic complexity. Numerical simulations on the 1D Heisenberg XYZ model validate the theoretical soundness and shot-noise resilience of our method. Furthermore, an advantage analysis reveals that our protocol exponentially outperforms standard Trotterized Adiabatic State Preparation (TASP) at equivalent circuit depths. This single-ancilla framework provides a highly practical and deterministic pathway for many-body ground state preparation on Early Fault-Tolerant (EFT) quantum architectures.

Abstract: The stability of motional-mode frequency is essential for realizing high-fidelity quantum gates in trapped-ion quantum computing. While broadband Gaussian noise has been extensively studied and mitigated using pulse shaping techniques, the impact of coherent periodic noise has remained largely unexplored. Here we report a systematic investigation of 60-Hz power-line noise and its effect on the secular frequencies of a single ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^{+}$ ion. Using spin-echo Ramsey spectroscopy, we characterize the amplitude and phase of the resulting secular-frequency modulation and validate this characterization via passive phase correction of the Ramsey sequence. Building on this, we implement active cancellation by injecting a compensation tone into the set-point of a PI controller that stabilizes the trap RF drive amplitude. A phasor-fitting procedure optimizes the amplitude and phase of the compensation signal, enabling near-complete suppression of the 60-Hz component. With active cancellation engaged, the coherence time of a radial motional mode is extended from approximately 10 ms to 35 ms, consistent with the limit set by motional heating. Our results provide both a clear characterization of periodic motional-mode noise and a practical framework for its suppression in trapped-ion quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: Squeezed states, crucial for quantum metrology and emerging quantum technologies, have been demonstrated in various platforms, but quantum squeezing of magnons in macroscopic spin systems remains elusive. Here we report the experimental observation of quantum-level magnon squeezing in a millimeter-scale yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere. By engineering a strong dispersive magnon-superconducting qubit coupling via a microwave cavity, we implement a significant self-Kerr nonlinearity to generate squeezed magnon states with their mean magnon number less than one. Harnessing a magnon-assisted Raman process, we perform Wigner tomography, revealing quadrature variances of $\sim\!0.8$ ($\sim\!1.0$~dB squeezing) relative to the vacuum. These results lay the groundwork for quantum nonlinear magnonics and promise potential applications in quantum metrology.

Motivation: 传统量子储层计算因量子态演化的递归非线性，其逆向变换（从输出重构输入）被认为难以实现。本研究旨在突破这一限制，探索QRC中双向可逆信息转换的可能性。

Method: 提出包含交叉密钥配对的四方程编解码协议，构造满足所有方程的量子储层与密钥组合。采用10量子比特的全XYZ哈密顿量储层，特征维度扩展至76维。

Result: 理想条件下实现机器精度重构（MSE~10⁻¹⁷），数据长度达30；发现秩条件dim(V)≥N_c为必要判据；噪声分析显示非对称资源分配（编码10次、解码10⁵次）可使MSE提升两个数量级；实际噪声下MSE退化至10⁻³-10⁻¹。

Conclusion: 研究证明了量子储层计算中双向可逆信息转换的可行性，虽需误差缓解以支持实际应用，但为QRC功能扩展提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) exploits fixed quantum dynamics and a trainable linear readout to process temporal data, yet reversing the transformation -- reconstructing the input from the reservoir output -- has been considered intractable owing to the recursive nonlinearity of sequential quantum state evolution. Here we propose a four-equation encode-decode protocol with cross-key pairing and constructively show that quantum reservoir and key combinations satisfying all four equations exist. Using a full XYZ Hamiltonian reservoir with 10 data qubits, we expand the feature dimension to 76 without increasing qubit count and achieve machine-precision reconstruction (mean-squared error $\mathrm{MSE} \sim 10^{-17}$) for data lengths up to 30 under ideal conditions; the rank condition $\mathrm{dim}(V) \geq N_c$ is identified as a necessary criterion. A comprehensive noise analysis across seven conditions and four baseline methods reveals a clear hierarchy: shot noise dominates, depolarizing noise adds a moderate factor, and asymmetric resource allocation -- 10 shots for encoding, $10^5$ for decoding -- yields approximately two orders of magnitude MSE improvement by exploiting the asymmetric noise roles of the encryption and decryption feature matrices. Under realistic noise the MSE degrades to $10^{-3}$-$10^{-1}$, indicating that error mitigation is needed before practical deployment, but our results establish the feasibility of bidirectional reversible information transformation within QRC.

Abstract: We introduce a method for the measurement of the lower bound on the initial polarization of spinful nuclei in a diamond by following the coherence evolution of an NV center spin qubit after a simple scheme is operated on the qubit to facilitate the transfer of information from the environment into the qubit state. Current polarization measurement techniques are challenging to implement due to the need for direct access to the environment. In our method, information is obtained by measuring the difference of the evolution of the qubit coherence resulting from preparation phase when the environment evolution is conditional on the qubit pointer state. We find that the method does not depend strongly on the applied magnetic field, but rather on the number of spinfull nuclei that lead to decoherence, and gives a reasonable estimate if the environment is polarized. The key advantage of this approach is its simplicity and minimal experimental requirements, allowing the inference of initial nuclear polarizations without direct access to the environment. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method using a simulated environment of up to fifteen randomly placed nuclear spins.

Abstract: We present a quantum optical scheme for imaging transversely displaced thermal sources of arbitrary intensities by employing multiphoton interference with a reference single-photon Fock state at a beamsplitter. Obtaining an analytical form for transverse momenta-resolved $L$-photon probabilities in either output, we show via Fisher information analysis that separation estimators built using interference sampling of multiphoton events exhibit significantly enhanced precision vis-à-vis existing imaging schemes over a wide range of separations and brightness. Even-photon-number coincidences exhibit constant precision in the sub-Rayleigh regime, demonstrating quantum superresolution of our scheme beyond the diffraction limit. For sources emitting on average $N_s\sim1$ photon per frame (such as in IR emission of thermal sources), precision bounds for our scheme scale linearly in $N_s$, exemplifying an enhanced precision of estimators in relation to weak sources $N_s\ll1$, and matching the ultimate quantum scaling. Finally, transverse momenta resolution in the Fourier plane produces finite imaging precisions for intermediate and large source separations using coarse pixel sizes of order $δy\sim100\,μ\mathrm{m}$ for exemplary image spot sizes $σ_x \sim 0.1\, μ\mathrm{m}$, in contrast with existing schemes of diffraction-limited direct imaging and superresolved inversion interferometric imaging that are severely degraded by coarse pixel sizes and have limited use. Combining the relatively straightforward sensing operation of Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometers with multiphoton coincidence detection of arbitrarily bright thermal sources and inner variable resolution of transverse photonic momenta, our scheme offers a robust alternative to non-invasive single-particle tracking and imaging of bright sources in nanoscopic chemical and biological systems.

Abstract: To operate quantum sensors at their quantum limit in real time, it is crucial to identify efficient data inference tools for rapid parameter estimation. In photodetection, the key challenge is the fast interpretation of click-patterns that exhibit non-classical statistics -- the very features responsible for the quantum enhancement of precision. We achieve this goal by comparing Bayesian likelihood-free methods with ones based on deep learning (DL). While the former are more conceptually intuitive, the latter, once trained, provide significantly faster estimates with comparable precision and yield similar predictions of the associated errors, challenging a common misconception that DL lacks such capabilities. We first verify both approaches for an analytically tractable, yet multiparameter, scenario of a two-level system emitting uncorrelated photons. Our main result, however, is the application to a driven nonlinear optomechanical device emitting non-classical light with complex multiclick correlations; in this case, our methods are essential for fast inference and, hence, unlock the possibility of distinguishing different photon statistics in real time. Our results pave the way for dynamical control of quantum sensors that leverage non-classical effects in photodetection.

Abstract: Local Hilbert spaces with large dimension are of key interest for quantum information with applications in quantum computing and memories, quantum simulations and metrology. Thanks to its weak coupling to external perturbations, the large ground-state nuclear spin manifold of fermionic alkaline-earth atoms is an exciting resource to explore for quantum information. Simultaneous single atom and state-resolved detection however remains an outstanding challenge limiting the development of novel quantum computing and simulation schemes beyond qubits. Here, we report on a new imaging technique enabling the simultaneous detection of up to four quantum states encoded in the nuclear spin manifold of a single fermionic strontium atom within 100 microseconds, with state-resolved detection fidelities ranging from 0.936 to 0.997. This technique is further used to track the highly coherent nuclear spin dynamics after a quench highlighting the potential of this system for quantum information. These results offer fascinating perspectives for quantum science with multi-electron atoms ranging from qudit-based quantum computing to quantum simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model.

TL;DR: A theoretical model using master equation with careful secular approximation fixes the "double counting" problem in quantum heat valve theory, using ohmic baths instead of structured ones, and better explains experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous quantum heat valve models had conceptual issues: (1) double-counting of the resonator (appearing both in bath spectral density and as part of the open system), and (2) use of unphysical structured bath spectral densities. These issues raised questions about physical interpretation.

Method: Developed a theoretical model based on a master equation approach with careful partial secular approximation, using ohmic spectral density for the two thermal baths.

Result: The model successfully describes experimental results on a quantum heat valve and improves upon previous theoretical models that suffered from the resonator double-counting issue.

Conclusion: Careful application of the master equation approach, particularly the secular approximation, is a useful tool for explaining realistic experimental setups and resolves conceptual problems in quantum heat valve theory.

Abstract: We provide a theoretical model for the non-equilibrium steady state heat flow through a quantum heat valve. The model is based on a master equation approach, where the partial secular approximation has been carefully performed in order to obtain accurate results. Our study assumes an ohmic spectral density for the two thermal baths of the model. This is in contrast with previous treatments of the quantum heat valve, where the baths have been assumed as being structured with a peaked spectral density near the resonance frequency of the resonator. These studies have also taken the resonator to be a part of the open quantum system of interest, which results in double counting of the resonator, as the latter appears both in the spectral density of the bath and as a part of the open system. Although this model accounts for the observations in a satisfactory way, it raises issues regarding its physical interpretation. Our method solves this conceptual problem. We apply it to describe an experiment on a quantum heat valve, showing that it successfully captures the experimental results and improves upon the previous theoretical model, which suffered from the resonator double-counting issue. Our findings confirm that the careful application of the master equation approach, in particular when it comes to the secular approximation, is a useful tool for explaining realistic experimental setups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Klein-Gordon equation for relativistic scalar bosons is second-order in time derivatives, causing interpretational difficulties; seeks a first-order formulation analogous to the Dirac equation for fermions

Method: Derives a novel quantum wave equation for scalar bosons that is first-order in time derivatives, structurally mirroring the Dirac equation with a two-component wavefunction

Result: Achieves a regular non-relativistic limit reducing to the Schrödinger equation; demonstrates the scalar boson wavefunction has two components (vs. Dirac's four) while preserving relativistic consistency

Conclusion: Provides a mathematically regular first-order relativistic wave equation for spin-0 particles, resolving limitations of the Klein-Gordon formalism while maintaining full compatibility with quantum mechanics principles

Abstract: We show that, in the relativistic regime, scalar bosons satisfy a quantum wave equation which is quite analogous to the Dirac equation. In contrast with the Klein-Gordon equation it is first order with respect to time derivation. It leads in a regular way to the standard Schrödinger equation in the non-relativistic limit. There are two components for the wave function in this representation for the scalar boson, in a way completely analogous to the four components for the spin $1/2$ fermion in the Dirac equation.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proves that GAP measures (Scrooge measures) have a closure property under quantum wave function collapse: if a wave function is GAP-distributed before collapse, it remains GAP-distributed after collapse, applying to both observer measurements and spontaneous collapse theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and characterize a previously unrecognized dynamical property of GAP measures in quantum statistical mechanics, specifically their behavior under state collapse, which has implications for quantum measurement theory and spontaneous collapse models.

Method: Mathematical analysis and proof of the conditional distribution property of GAP measures under wave function collapse, examining both measurement-induced and spontaneous collapse scenarios.

Result: GAP measures are closed under collapse: if Ψ follows GAP_ρ distribution, then the conditional distribution of the collapsed wave function Ψ' (given measurement outcome or collapse history) is GAP_{ρ'} where ρ' is the updated density matrix.

Conclusion: GAP measures possess a fundamental stability under collapse dynamics, making them uniquely preserved across different collapse mechanisms (observer measurements and spontaneous theories like CSL/GRW), suggesting they are natural invariant distributions in quantum collapse processes.

Abstract: GAP measures (also known as Scrooge measures) are a natural class of probability distributions on the unit sphere of a Hilbert space that come up in quantum statistical mechanics; for each density matrix $ρ$ there is a unique measure GAP$_ρ$. We describe and prove a property of these measures that was not recognized so far: If a wave function $Ψ$ is GAP$_ρ$ distributed and a collapse occurs, then the collapsed wave function $Ψ'$ is again GAP distributed (relative to the appropriate $ρ'$). This fact applies to collapses due to a quantum measurement carried out by an observer, as well as to spontaneous collapse theories such as CSL or GRW. More precisely, it is the conditional distribution of $Ψ'$, given the measurement outcome (respectively, the noise in CSL or the collapse history in GRW), that is GAP$_{ρ'}$.

Abstract: Josephson junctions are a key element of superconducting quantum technology, serving as the core building blocks of superconducting qubits. We present an experimental study on room-temperature electrical tuning of aluminum junctions, showing that voltage pulses can controllably increase their resistance and adjust the Josephson energy while maintaining qubit quality factors above 1 million. We find that the rate of resistance increase scales exponentially with pulse amplitude during manipulation, after which the spontaneous resistance increase scales proportionally to the amount of manipulation. We show that this spontaneous increase halts at cryogenic temperatures, and resumes again at room temperature. Using our stepwise protocol, we achieve up to a 270% increase in junction resistance, corresponding to a reduction of nearly 2 GHz of the qubit transition frequency. These results establish the achievable range, relaxation behavior, and practical limits of electrical tuning, enabling post-fabrication mitigation of frequency crowding in quantum processors.

Abstract: We investigate the behaviors of thermal entanglement, quantum correlation beyond entanglement namely, measurement-induced nonlocality (MIN) and coherence in a nickel radical molecular magnet (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L], whose spin-spin interactions are well described by the Heisenberg model. Using experimentally estimated coupling parameters, we compute the thermal state of the system and analyze the dependence of quantum resources on temperature and magnetic field. The results indicate that the quantum resources of the nickel-radical molecular magnet persist even at room temperature. We show that while negativity (the entanglement measure) rapidly vanishes with increasing temperature and magnetic field, measurement-induced nonlocality and quantum coherence remain comparatively more stable and persist in regions where entanglement is absent. These results highlight the significance of nonclassical correlations beyond entanglement in thermally activated spin systems and suggest that such molecular magnets could serve as viable platforms for quantum information processing in realistic conditions.

Motivation: To access quantum nonlinear regimes (single-photon strong-coupling and sideband resolution) simultaneously in optomechanics for quantum state engineering, which is typically experimentally challenging.

Method: Formulated system dynamics using an effective master-equation approach, benchmarked against quantum Langevin and dressed-state master-equation models, with experimentally realistic parameters.

Result: Predicted clear quantum signatures including photon blockade and generation of mechanical cat states, enabled by the system's drastically reduced effective optical linewidth from coherent/dissipative mode hybridization.

Conclusion: The Fano-mirror architecture is a viable platform for harnessing single-photon optomechanical nonlinearities to engineer quantum states under achievable experimental conditions.

Abstract: We study a Fano-mirror optomechanical system in the quantum nonlinear regime. In this system, two strongly lossy optical modes hybridize through both coherent and dissipative couplings to form an effective optical mode with a drastically reduced linewidth. This linewidth reduction enables the system to access the single-photon strong-coupling and sideband-resolved regimes simultaneously. We formulate the system dynamics using an effective master-equation approach and benchmark it against quantum Langevin and dressed-state master-equation descriptions. With experimentally realistic parameters, we predict clear quantum signatures, including photon blockade and the generation of mechanical cat states. Our work establishes the Fano-mirror architecture as a promising platform for harnessing single-photon optomechanical nonlinearities for quantum state engineering under achievable experimental conditions.

Abstract: The quantum tunneling time remains the subject of heated debate,

  superluminal tunneling.
  Our tunnel-ionization model of the time-delay, presented in previous work, shows good agreement with the attoclock measurement in the adiabatic and nonadiabatic field calibrations, which also enables the determination of the barrier time-delay.
  In the present work, we show that the tunnel-ionization for H-like atoms with large nuclear charge can be superluminal (quantum superluminality), which in principle can be investigated experimentally using the attoclock scheme.
  We discuss the quantum superluminality in detail for the different regimes of the tunnel-ionization. Our result shows that quantum tunneling faster-than-light is indeed possible, albeit only under somewhat extreme conditions.

Conclusion: CQM是缓解NISQ硬件异质性的有前途方案，为迈向容错量子计算提供了实用路径

Abstract: Quantum computers show promise to solve select problems otherwise intractable on classical computers. However, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era devices are currently prone to various sources of error. Quantum error correction (QEC) shows promise as a path towards fault tolerant quantum computing. Surface codes, in particular, have become ubiquitous throughout literature for their efficacy as a quantum error correcting code, and can execute quantum circuits via lattice surgery operations. Lattice surgery also allows for logical qubits to maneuver around the architecture, if there is space for it. Hardware used for near-term demonstrations have both spatially and temporally varying error results in logical qubits. By maneuvering logical qubits around the topology, an average logical error rate (LER) can be enforced. We propose cyclic qubit mappings (CQM), a dynamic remapping technique implemented during compilation to mitigate hardware heterogeneity by expanding and contracting logical qubits. In addition to LER averaging, CQM shows initial promise given it's minimal execution time overhead and effective resource utilization.

TL;DR: A tangent-space decomposition method separates quantum gate errors into coherent, Markovian, and non-Markovian components from a single tomographic measurement, validated on trapped ion qubits to quantify complex error sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional quantum benchmarking assumes simple Markovian noise, but real devices suffer from coherent miscalibrations and temporally correlated (non-Markovian) errors that complicate diagnosis and mitigation.

Method: Apply tangent-space decomposition to treat gate imperfections as tangent vectors in quantum channel space, naturally separating deviations into three components: coherent, Markovian, and non-Markovian processes from a single tomographic snapshot.

Result: Experimentally validated on single-qubit gates in trapped ⁴⁰Ca⁺ ions, successfully identifying and quantifying non-Markovian effects from slow environmental fluctuations and deterministic coherent miscalibrations using reconstructed process matrices.

Conclusion: Provides a physically transparent, experimentally accessible tool for diagnosing complex error sources in quantum control systems, enabling targeted error mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of coherent and non-Markovian errors remains a central challenge in quantum information processing, as conventional benchmarking techniques typically rely on Markovian and time-independent noise assumptions. In practice, however, quantum devices exhibit both systematic coherent miscalibrations and temporally correlated fluctuations, which complicate error diagnosis and mitigation. Here, we apply a technique based on tangent-space decomposition to characterize such error in single-qubit quantum gates implemented on a trapped ion platform. Small imperfections in a quantum operation are treated as perturbations of the target quantum map, represented as tangent vectors in the space of quantum channels. This formulations enables a natural decomposition of the deviation into three components corresponding to coherent, Markovian and non-Markovian processes.The relative weights of these components provide a quantitative measure of the contribution from each type of error mechanism, directly from a single tomographic snapshot. We experimentally validate this method on a single-qubit gates implemented on a trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion, where control is achieved through laser-driven optical transitions. By analyzing experimentally reconstructed process matrices, expressed in the Pauli Transfer Matrix and Choi representations, we identify and quantify non-Markovian effects arising from controlled injection of slow fluctuations in the experimental environment. We also characterize deterministic coherent miscalibrations using the same technique. This approach provides a physically transparent and experimentally accessible tool for diagnosing complex error sources in quantum control systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用玻色Fock空间的灵活性（任何经典概率分布都可以在其上实现），将其作为研究量子过程的多功能框架，为超对称问题提供新的计算方法。

Method: 1) 构造含1个玻色和2个费米自由度的最小玻色化系统；2) 迭代构建超对称系统塔；3) 识别osp(2|2)对称性；4) 创新性地提出跨扇区诱导不可约表示：方法一从费米子表示（Clifford代数）出发诱导至gl(2|2)再限制到osp(2|2)，方法二从玻色子扇区表示诱导；5) 将表示表达为量子比特算符。

Conclusion: 该工作为使用量子信息方法求解超对称问题提供了新途径，其诱导表示框架为在混合架构量子计算机上实现超对称系统模拟奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: We consider bosonization of supersymmetry in the context of Wess-Zumino quantum mechanics. Our motivation for this investigation is the flexibility the bosonic fock space affords as any classical probability distribution can be realized on it making it a versatile framework to work with for quantum processes. We proceed by constructing a minimal bosonization of a system with one bosonic and two fermionic degrees of freedom. We iterate this process to construct a tower of SUSY systems that is akin to unfolded Adinkras. We then identify an osp(2|2) symmetry of the system constructed. To build an irreducible representation of the system we induce representations across the sectors, a first to our knowledge, as the previous work have focused on induction only within the bosonic sector. First, we start with a fermionic representation using Clifford algebras and then induce a representation to gl(2|2) and restrict it to osp(2|2). In the second method, we induce a representation from that of the bosonic sector. In both cases, our representations are in terms of qubit operators that provide a way to solve SUSY problems using quantum information based approaches. Depending upon the direction of induction the representations are suitable for implementation on a hybrid qubit and fermionic or bosonic quantum computers.

*Shao-Hen Chiew,Armando Angrisani,Zoë Holmes,Giuseppe Carleo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种在量子硬件上模拟海森堡绘景的通用框架，通过向量化映射将算符映射为量子态，从而将海森堡算符任务转化为可执行的薛定谔绘景任务，提供算子采样、OTOC、超算符期望值等协议，并在数字和模拟量子处理器上实现2D问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量子模拟多在薛定谔绘景下进行，而海森堡绘景在处理时间演化算符和多点关联函数时具有优势，但难以直接在量子硬件上实现。该研究旨在填补这一空白，提供一种高效的映射方法，使得海森堡绘景的模拟能够利用现有量子计算资源。

Method: 基于向量化映射（vectorization map），将海森堡算符映射为量子态，从而将海森堡绘景的任务转化为薛定谔绘景的量子态演化任务。该框架继承了薛定谔绘景的资源需求和结构，便于在量子硬件上实现。针对2D问题，提出数字和模拟量子模拟器的具体实现方案，并考虑设备连通性约束。

Result: 该框架能够高效地实现算子采样、OTOC（out-of-time-ordered correlators）、超算符期望值及其高阶矩、两点关联函数、算子稳定子及纠缠熵等任务。相比传统方法，协议有所改进或全新提出。在2D问题上展示了可行性。

Conclusion: 该工作为在量子硬件上模拟海森堡绘景提供了通用且实用的框架，拓展了量子模拟的工具箱，并为未来在更大规模系统上的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present a general framework for simulating quantum systems in the Heisenberg picture on quantum hardware. Based on the vectorization map, our framework fully exploits the mapping between operators and quantum states, allowing any task defined on Heisenberg operators to be mapped to standard Schrödinger-picture tasks that are naturally accessible via quantum computers and simulators. This yields new or improved protocols for tasks such as operator sampling, the computation of OTOCs/superoperator expectation values and their higher order moments, two-point correlators, and operator stabilizer and entanglement entropies. Our approach is also amenable to implementation, as it inherits the structure and resource requirements of the (forward and time-reversed) Schrödinger-picture quantum simulation problem. We demonstrate this by proposing implementations of our framework for a 2D problem on digital and analog quantum simulators, taking into account device connectivity constraints.

### [171] [On the Dynamics of Observation and Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18494)
*Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文挑战了将语义视为潜表征静态属性的主流范式，提出智能是物理可实现体的属性，受有限记忆、算力和能量约束。通过建立观测语义纤维丛框架，证明热力学成本（兰道尔原理）对内部状态转移复杂度施加了严格限制（语义常数B）。由此推导出符号结构的必要性：为在B约束下建模组合性世界，语义流形必须经历相变，结晶成离散、组合且因子化的形式。因此语言和逻辑是存在必然性而非文化产物，是防止热崩溃所需的信息固态形式。理解不是恢复潜变量，而是构建使世界算法可压缩且因果可预测的因果商空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前视觉智能中将语义视为高维嵌入空间中几何邻近性的静态观点，认为该观点在物理上不完整，忽视了智能体作为受物理约束（有限记忆、算力、能量）的系统与高熵环境交互的本质。

Method: 提出“观测语义纤维丛”的运动学结构，将原始感官观测数据（纤维）投影到低熵因果语义流形（基空间）。基于兰道尔原理，形式化信息处理的 thermodynamic cost，并证明其对有界智能体内部状态转移复杂度的限制，定义此极限为“语义常数B”。

Result: 1. 推导出“语义常数B”的存在，它是热力学约束下智能体信息处理能力的根本限制。
2. 证明为了在常数B的约束下对组合性世界进行建模，语义流形必须经历相变，形成离散、组合且因子化的结构。
3. 得出语言和逻辑并非文化产物，而是应对物理约束的“存在必然性”，是信息必须采取以防止系统“热崩溃”的固态形式。

Conclusion: 理解并非恢复隐藏的潜变量，而是构建一个“因果商空间”，使世界变得算法上可压缩且因果上可预测。智能的本质是在物理约束下，通过构建离散符号系统来实现对环境的有效建模和预测。

Abstract: A dominant paradigm in visual intelligence treats semantics as a static property of latent representations, assuming that meaning can be discovered through geometric proximity in high dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite energy interacting with a high entropy environment. We formalize this interaction through the kinematic structure of an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory observation data (the fiber) is projected onto a low entropy causal semantic manifold (the base). We prove that for any bounded agent, the thermodynamic cost of information processing (Landauer's Principle) imposes a strict limit on the complexity of internal state transitions. We term this limit the Semantic Constant B. From these physical constraints, we derive the necessity of symbolic structure. We show that to model a combinatorial world within the bound B, the semantic manifold must undergo a phase transition, it must crystallize into a discrete, compositional, and factorized form. Thus, language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities the solid state of information required to prevent thermal collapse. We conclude that understanding is not the recovery of a hidden latent variable, but the construction of a causal quotient that renders the world algorithmically compressible and causally predictable.

*Michal Töpfer,František Plášil,Tomáš Bureš,Petr Hnětynka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结合FCL时态逻辑与vibe coding反馈循环的生成式LLM方法，用于自动生成复杂自适应系统的适应性管理器(AM)，实验表明仅需少量迭代即可生成符合精确功能约束的AM代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统复杂自适应系统(CAS)的适应性管理器(AM)实现需精确定义动态架构与行为变更，而生成式LLM虽能自动生成AM代码，但存在正确性验证难题；现有方法依赖人工代码审查，效率低下。

Method: 1) 提出新型时态逻辑FCL替代传统LTL，以更细粒度描述系统行为轨迹的约束条件；2) 设计双循环机制：将FCL约束实时评估嵌入适应循环与vibe coding反馈循环，通过LLM迭代接收约束违反报告并修正代码。

Result: 在两项CAS案例实验中，仅需数次反馈循环迭代即可生成符合FCL约束的AM；结合多初始设置实现高运行路径覆盖，显著降低人工审查成本。

Conclusion: 当功能需求以FCL精确形式化时，基于vibe coding反馈循环的LLM生成AM方法是可行的；双循环机制能有效平衡生成效率与正确性验证，为CAS自适应管理提供新范式。

Abstract: In CAS adaptation, a challenge is to define the dynamic architecture of the system and changes in its behavior. Implementation-wise, this is projected into an adaptation mechanism, typically realized as an Adaptation Manager (AM). With the advances of generative LLMs, generating AM code based on system specification and desired AM behavior (partially in natural language) is a tempting opportunity. The recent introduction of vibe coding suggests a way to target the problem of the correctness of generated code by iterative testing and vibe coding feedback loops instead of direct code inspection.
  In this paper, we show that generating an AM via vibe coding feedback loops is a viable option when the verification of the generated AM is based on a very precise formulation of the functional requirements. We specify these as constraints in a novel temporal logic FCL that allows us to express the behavior of traces with much finer granularity than classical LTL enables.
  Furthermore, we show that by combining the adaptation and vibe coding feedback loops where the FCL constraints are evaluated for the current system state, we achieved good results in the experiments with generating AMs for two example systems from the CAS domain. Typically, just a few feedback loop iterations were necessary, each feeding the LLM with reports describing detailed violations of the constraints. This AM testing was combined with high run path coverage achieved by different initial settings.

TL;DR: GEARS框架通过专用智能体技能自动化排名优化假设生成，内置验证机制确保部署稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模排名系统进步瓶颈在于将模糊产品意图转化为可执行、可验证假设的工程过程，而非建模技术本身

Method: 构建可编程实验环境实现自主发现；利用专业化智能体技能封装专家知识；支持高层意图驱动；集成统计验证钩子过滤脆弱策略

Result: 跨产品表面实验显示GEARS持续发现近帕累托最优策略，兼具算法信号融合与部署稳定性

Conclusion: 该框架通过智能体协作解决排名优化意图转化难题，为复杂系统优化提供可靠自动化新范式

Abstract: Modern large-scale ranking systems operate within a sophisticated landscape of competing objectives, operational constraints, and evolving product requirements. Progress in this domain is increasingly bottlenecked by the engineering context constraint: the arduous process of translating ambiguous product intent into reasonable, executable, verifiable hypotheses, rather than by modeling techniques alone. We present GEARS (Generative Engine for Agentic Ranking Systems), a framework that reframes ranking optimization as an autonomous discovery process within a programmable experimentation environment. Rather than treating optimization as static model selection, GEARS leverages Specialized Agent Skills to encapsulate ranking expert knowledge into reusable reasoning capabilities, enabling operators to steer systems via high-level intent vibe personalization. Furthermore, to ensure production reliability, the framework incorporates validation hooks to enforce statistical robustness and filter out brittle policies that overfit short-term signals. Experimental validation across diverse product surfaces demonstrates that GEARS consistently identifies superior, near-Pareto-efficient policies by synergizing algorithmic signals with deep ranking context while maintaining rigorous deployment stability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将LLM的softmax分类器重新解释为基于能量的模型(EBM)，通过两个无需训练的能量指标（溢出能量和边缘化能量）检测幻觉，在9个基准测试和多个主流LLM上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成过程中存在事实错误、偏见和幻觉等问题，现有检测方法需训练探针或激活消融，缺乏无需训练且可解释的原理性方法。

Method: 将序列到序列概率链分解为多个交互EBM，追踪解码过程中的"能量溢出"现象。提出两个完全基于输出logits且无需训练的能量指标：溢出能量（捕获连续生成步骤间理论上应匹配的能量值差异）和边缘化能量（单步可测量），用于定位答案token并检测幻觉。

Result: 在LLaMA、Mistral、Gemma、Qwen3等多个SOTA模型的9个基准测试上，该方法展现了稳健且具有竞争力的幻觉检测性能和跨任务泛化能力，且适用于预训练和指令微调模型。

Conclusion: 这种基于能量的重新解释为幻觉检测提供了一种无需训练、原理清晰的替代方案，能有效定位错误并识别模型失效，具有良好的泛化性，避免了训练探针的开销。

Abstract: We reinterpret the final Large Language Model (LLM) softmax classifier as an Energy-Based Model (EBM), decomposing the sequence-to-sequence probability chain into multiple interacting EBMs at inference. This principled approach allows us to track "energy spills" during decoding, which we empirically show correlate with factual errors, biases, and failures. Similar to Orgad et al. (2025), our method localizes the exact answer token and subsequently tests for hallucinations. Crucially, however, we achieve this without requiring trained probe classifiers or activation ablations. Instead, we introduce two completely training-free metrics derived directly from output logits: spilled energy, which captures the discrepancy between energy values across consecutive generation steps that should theoretically match, and marginalized energy, which is measurable at a single step. Evaluated on nine benchmarks across state-of-the-art LLMs (including LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma) and on synthetic algebraic operations (Qwen3), our approach demonstrates robust, competitive hallucination detection and cross-task generalization. Notably, these results hold for both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants without introducing any training overhead.

### [175] [Many AI Analysts, One Dataset: Navigating the Agentic Data Science Multiverse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18710)
*Martin Bertran,Riccardo Fogliato,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using autonomous AI analysts (LLMs), researchers demonstrated that varying AI personas and prompts on identical data/hypotheses generates diverse, often contradictory research conclusions, replicating the human "many-analyst" reproducibility crisis at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research conclusions depend heavily on implicit analytic decisions, but studying this "many-analyst" effect is prohibitively expensive and rare in human teams. We need a scalable way to investigate how analytic choices affect results.

Method: Deployed LLM-based autonomous AI analysts to independently conduct full analyses on three datasets, testing pre-specified hypotheses while varying models and prompt framings. An AI auditor filtered for methodological validity across thousands of replicate runs.

Result: AI analyses showed wide dispersion in effect sizes, p-values, and binary conclusions - frequently reversing hypothesis support. Variation was systematic: specific preprocessing, modeling, and inference choices correlated with LLM type and assigned persona. These outcome distributions were steerable by changing AI configurations.

Conclusion: AI analysts can cheaply model the structured analytic diversity that undermines research reproducibility, proving analytic choices alone can flip conclusions. The "steerable" nature reveals both the fragility of research findings and potential paths to control it.

Abstract: The conclusions of empirical research depend not only on data but on a sequence of analytic decisions that published results seldom make explicit. Past ``many-analyst" studies have demonstrated this: independent teams testing the same hypothesis on the same dataset regularly reach conflicting conclusions. But such studies require months of coordination among dozens of research groups and are therefore rarely conducted. In this work, we show that fully autonomous AI analysts built on large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a similar structured analytic diversity cheaply and at scale. We task these AI analysts with testing a pre-specified hypothesis on a fixed dataset, varying the underlying model and prompt framing across replicate runs. Each AI analyst independently constructs and executes a full analysis pipeline; an AI auditor then screens each run for methodological validity. Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analyst-produced analyses display wide dispersion in effect sizes, $p$-values, and binary decisions on supporting the hypothesis or not, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis is judged supported. This dispersion is structured: recognizable analytic choices in preprocessing, model specification, and inference differ systematically across LLM and persona conditions. Critically, the effects are \emph{steerable}: reassigning the analyst persona or LLM shifts the distribution of outcomes even after excluding methodologically deficient runs.

Conclusion: ...

Abstract: Accelerating exploration in visual reinforcement learning under sparse rewards remains challenging due to the substantial task-irrelevant variations. Despite advances in intrinsic exploration, many methods either assume access to low-dimensional states or lack task-aware exploration strategies, thereby rendering them fragile in visual domains. To bridge this gap, we present TEB, a Task-aware Exploration approach that tightly couples task-relevant representations with exploration through a predictive Bisimulation metric. Specifically, TEB leverages the metric not only to learn behaviorally grounded task representations but also to measure behaviorally intrinsic novelty over the learned latent space. To realize this, we first theoretically mitigate the representation collapse of degenerate bisimulation metrics under sparse rewards by internally introducing a simple but effective predicted reward differential. Building on this robust metric, we design potential-based exploration bonuses, which measure the relative novelty of adjacent observations over the latent space. Extensive experiments on MetaWorld and Maze2D show that TEB achieves superior exploration ability and outperforms recent baselines.

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework called Chart Insight Agent Flow using MLLMs generates deep chart insights, plus a new dataset ChartSummInsights shows significant improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chart summarization is vital for data accessibility, but current methods including MLLMs only produce low-level descriptions and miss the deeper insights that are visualization's core purpose.

Method: Proposed Chart Insight Agent Flow: a plan-and-execute multi-agent framework leveraging MLLMs' perceptual and reasoning capabilities to extract profound insights directly from chart images; introduced ChartSummInsights dataset with real-world charts and expert-authored high-quality summaries.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvement of MLLMs on chart summarization, generating summaries with deep and diverse insights.

Conclusion: The multi-agent framework effectively addresses current limitations by producing meaningful, high-level insights from charts, advancing the field of automated data analysis.

Abstract: Chart summarization is crucial for enhancing data accessibility and the efficient consumption of information. However, existing methods, including those with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focus on low-level data descriptions and often fail to capture the deeper insights which are the fundamental purpose of data visualization. To address this challenge, we propose Chart Insight Agent Flow, a plan-and-execute multi-agent framework effectively leveraging the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to uncover profound insights directly from chart images. Furthermore, to overcome the lack of suitable benchmarks, we introduce ChartSummInsights, a new dataset featuring a diverse collection of real-world charts paired with high-quality, insightful summaries authored by human data analysis experts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of MLLMs on the chart summarization task, producing summaries with deep and diverse insights.

TL;DR: LaDa: A federated reasoning distillation framework that addresses bidirectional model learnability gaps and domain adaptation through learnability-aware data allocation and contrastive reasoning path alignment between LLMs and SLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated LLM-SLM collaboration methods fail to address bidirectional model learnability gaps (where SLMs cannot identify high-reward samples matching their constraints and LLMs cannot select novel knowledge samples) and domain-agnostic reasoning transfer limitations.

Method: Proposes LaDa with two core components: (1) Model learnability-aware data filter that adaptively allocates high-reward samples based on learnability gaps between SLM-LLM pairs, and (2) Domain adaptive reasoning distillation that aligns joint probabilities of reasoning paths via contrastive distillation learning on filtered samples.

Result: Enables effective bidirectional knowledge transfer and allows SLMs to acquire step-by-step reasoning abilities tailored to local data distributions. Functions as a plug-in module for existing collaboration frameworks.

Conclusion: LaDa provides a learnability-adaptive approach to federated reasoning distillation that flexibly adapts knowledge transfer based on model gaps, addressing key challenges in LLM-SLM collaborative reasoning.

Abstract: Data allocation plays a critical role in federated large language model (LLM) and small language models (SLMs) reasoning collaboration. Nevertheless, existing data allocation methods fail to address an under-explored challenge in collaboration: bidirectional model learnability gap, where client-side SLMs cannot identify high-reward samples matching their learnability constraints for effective knowledge transfer from LLMs, while LLMs struggle to select samples contributing novel knowledge beyond their existing data. Furthermore, these collaboration frameworks face another key challenge: domain-agnostic reasoning transfer, where existing reasoning transfer methods fail to flexibly adapt to the local domain data, preventing SLMs from effectively acquiring step-by-step reasoning abilities within from general LLM. To address these challenges, we propose LaDa, a federated reasoning distillation framework with model learnability-aware data allocation. It introduces a model learnability-aware data filter that adaptively allocates high-reward samples based on the learnability gap between each SLM and LLM pair, effectively facilitating bidirectional knowledge transfer. We further design a domain adaptive reasoning distillation method that aligns joint probabilities of reasoning paths on filtered high-reward samples through contrastive distillation learning between SLM and LLM, enabling SLM to capture underlying reasoning patterns under local data distribution. LaDa operates as a plug-in module for existing collaboration frameworks, adapting knowledge transfer based on model learnability gaps.

Motivation: 为实现确定性、可审计的LLM智能体交互，理解SGD与MCP的内在一致性，提取可复用的schema设计原则，并填补生产环境扩展的关键空白，这对Software 3.0治理至关重要。

Method: 通过分析SGD(2019)与MCP的趋同性，抽象出核心设计原则，并提供每种原则的具体设计模式。

Result: 提出五个基础原则：语义完整性优于语法精度、显式行动边界、失败模式文档化、渐进式披露兼容性、工具间关系声明；揭示三个洞见：SGD设计应被MCP继承、两者均未充分利用失败模式与工具关系、渐进式披露是生产扩展的关键。

Conclusion: Schema驱动治理无需依赖专有系统检查即可实现AI系统可扩展监督，这将成为Software 3.0的核心治理机制。

Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental convergence: Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) represent two manifestations of a unified paradigm for deterministic, auditable LLM-agent interaction. SGD, designed for dialogue-based API discovery (2019), and MCP, now the de facto standard for LLM-tool integration, share the same core insight -- that schemas can encode not just tool signatures but operational constraints and reasoning guidance. By analyzing this convergence, we extract five foundational principles for schema design: (1) Semantic Completeness over Syntactic Precision, (2) Explicit Action Boundaries, (3) Failure Mode Documentation, (4) Progressive Disclosure Compatibility, and (5) Inter-Tool Relationship Declaration. These principles reveal three novel insights: first, SGD's original design was fundamentally sound and should be inherited by MCP; second, both frameworks leave failure modes and inter-tool relationships unexploited -- gaps we identify and resolve; third, progressive disclosure emerges as a critical production-scaling insight under real-world token constraints. We provide concrete design patterns for each principle. These principles position schema-driven governance as a scalable mechanism for AI system oversight without requiring proprietary system inspection -- central to Software 3.0.

Conclusion: LAMMI-Pathology是一个可扩展的病理智能体框架，通过结合分子验证数据和工具调用范式，推动病理诊断向更精确、可解释的方向发展。

Abstract: The emergence of tool-calling-based agent systems introduces a more evidence-driven paradigm for pathology image analysis in contrast to the coarse-grained text-image diagnostic approaches. With the recent large-scale experimental adoption of spatial transcriptomics technologies, molecularly validated pathological diagnosis is becoming increasingly open and accessible. In this work, we propose LAMMI-Pathology (LVLM-Agent System for Molecularly Informed Medical Intelligence in Pathology), a scalable agent framework for domain-specific agent tool-calling. LAMMI-Pathology adopts a tool-centric, bottom-up architecture in which customized domain-adaptive tools serve as the foundation. These tools are clustered by domain style to form component agents, which are then coordinated through a top-level planner hierarchically, avoiding excessively long context lengths that could induce task drift. Based on that, we introduce a novel trajectory construction mechanism based on Atomic Execution Nodes (AENs), which serve as reliable and composable units for building semi-simulated reasoning trajectories that capture credible agent-tool interactions. Building on this foundation, we develop a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy that aligns the planner's decision-making process with these multi-step reasoning trajectories, thereby enhancing inference robustness in pathology understanding and its adaptive use of the customized toolset.

Conclusion: 生成模型在路径规划任务中具有潜力，为复杂环境推理提供新解决方案

Abstract: Path planning in complex environments is one of the key problems of artificial intelligence because it requires simultaneous understanding of the geometry of space and the global structure of the problem. In this paper, we explore the potential of using generative models as planning and reasoning mechanisms. We propose GenPlanner, an approach based on diffusion models and flow matching, along with two variants: DiffPlanner and FlowPlanner. We demonstrate the application of generative models to find and generate correct paths in mazes. A multi-channel condition describing the structure of the environment, including an obstacle map and information about the starting and destination points, is used to condition trajectory generation. Unlike standard methods, our models generate trajectories iteratively, starting with random noise and gradually transforming it into a correct solution. Experiments conducted show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline CNN model. In particular, FlowPlanner demonstrates high performance even with a limited number of generation steps.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly smaller, deployable variants, exhibit a critical deficiency in understanding temporal and procedural visual data, a bottleneck hindering their application in real-world embodied AI. This gap is largely caused by a systemic failure in training paradigms, which lack large-scale, procedurally coherent data. To address this problem, we introduce TPRU, a large-scale dataset sourced from diverse embodied scenarios such as robotic manipulation and GUI navigation. TPRU is systematically designed to cultivate temporal reasoning through three complementary tasks: Temporal Reordering, Next-Frame Prediction, and Previous-Frame Review. A key feature is the inclusion of challenging negative samples, compelling models to transition from passive observation to active, cross-modal validation. We leverage TPRU with a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methodology, specifically targeting the enhancement of resource-efficient models. Experiments show our approach yields dramatic gains: on our manually curated TPRU-Test, the accuracy of TPRU-7B soars from 50.33\% to 75.70\%, a state-of-the-art result that significantly outperforms vastly larger baselines, including GPT-4o. Crucially, these capabilities generalize effectively, demonstrating substantial improvements on established benchmarks. The codebase is available at https://github.com/Stephen-gzk/TPRU/ .

TL;DR: 使用消费级LLM通过迭代流程解决了一个复杂的数学猜想，证明AI在高层次证明搜索中有用，但人类专家对确保正确性仍不可或缺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏LLM在科研级数学中实际应用的证据，尤其对个体研究者可访问的工作流程。本研究旨在探索LLM在真实数学研究中的辅助作用与局限性。

Method: 通过可审计的案例研究，分析七个ChatGPT-5.2对话线程和四个版本化证明草稿，采用"生成-评审-修复"的迭代流程来解决特定矩阵猜想。

Result: 成功解决了Ran和Teng (2024)的Conjecture 20，给出了4-圈行随机非负矩阵族非实谱区域的充要条件及明确边界构造；同时揭示了LLM在证明搜索中作用显著，但正确性验证仍是瓶颈。

Conclusion: LLM可作为数学研究的有效辅助工具，但人类专家在关键验证环节不可替代；研究为AI辅助科研流程评估和人在回路定理证明系统设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as scientific copilots, but evidence on their role in research-level mathematics remains limited, especially for workflows accessible to individual researchers. We present early evidence for vibe-proving with a consumer subscription LLM through an auditable case study that resolves Conjecture 20 of Ran and Teng (2024) on the exact nonreal spectral region of a 4-cycle row-stochastic nonnegative matrix family. We analyze seven shareable ChatGPT-5.2 (Thinking) threads and four versioned proof drafts, documenting an iterative pipeline of generate, referee, and repair. The model is most useful for high-level proof search, while human experts remain essential for correctness-critical closure. The final theorem provides necessary and sufficient region conditions and explicit boundary attainment constructions. Beyond the mathematical result, we contribute a process-level characterization of where LLM assistance materially helps and where verification bottlenecks persist, with implications for evaluation of AI-assisted research workflows and for designing human-in-the-loop theorem proving systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出深度研究智能体评估中存在"合成幻觉"问题——表面流畅性和引用对齐掩盖了底层事实和推理缺陷。为此提出DREAM框架，通过让评估过程也具备智能体能力来实现能力对等，显著提升对事实错误和时效性衰减的敏感度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估深度研究智能体面临根本挑战：缺乏单一标准答案且研究质量多维。现有基准存在"合成幻觉"——表面流畅性和引用对齐掩盖事实/推理缺陷，且静态评估器因缺乏工具使用能力而无法判断时效正确性和事实准确性。

Method: 提出DREAM（深度研究智能体评估）框架，通过让评估具备智能体能力实现"能力对等"。它结合与查询无关的指标和工具调用智能体生成的自适应指标，实现时效感知覆盖、接地验证和系统化推理探测。

Result: 对照评估表明，DREAM比现有基准显著更敏感于事实错误和时效性衰减，提供可扩展、无参考的评估范式。

Conclusion: DREAM框架通过使评估过程智能化，解决了深度研究智能体评估中的关键能力错配问题，能更敏感地检测事实和时效错误，同时提供可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Research Agents generate analyst-grade reports, yet evaluating them remains challenging due to the absence of a single ground truth and the multidimensional nature of research quality. Recent benchmarks propose distinct methodologies, yet they suffer from the Mirage of Synthesis, where strong surface-level fluency and citation alignment can obscure underlying factual and reasoning defects. We characterize this gap by introducing a taxonomy across four verticals that exposes a critical capability mismatch: static evaluators inherently lack the tool-use capabilities required to assess temporal validity and factual correctness. To address this, we propose DREAM (Deep Research Evaluation with Agentic Metrics), a framework that instantiates the principle of capability parity by making evaluation itself agentic. DREAM structures assessment through an evaluation protocol combining query-agnostic metrics with adaptive metrics generated by a tool-calling agent, enabling temporally aware coverage, grounded verification, and systematic reasoning probes. Controlled evaluations demonstrate DREAM is significantly more sensitive to factual and temporal decay than existing benchmarks, offering a scalable, reference-free evaluation paradigm.

TL;DR: 本文提出高维程序化内容生成(HDPCG)框架，将非几何游戏机制作为一等公民纳入联合状态空间，通过空间方向(4D坐标)和时间方向(时间扩展图)两个维度，配合通用算法管线，实现超越几何的可控、可验证、可扩展的关卡生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有程序化内容生成(PCG)方法主要关注静态2D/3D几何结构，将游戏机制视为辅助因素且仅在空间维度优化，这限制了生成的可控性与表现力。

Method: 提出HDPCG框架，将非几何游戏机制提升为联合状态空间的一等坐标。具体实现两个方向：1)空间方向通过离散层维度实现4D(x,y,z,l)可达性验证，支持重力反转等机制；2)时间方向通过时间扩展图捕捉时序动力学与冲突规则。每个方向提供三种遵循"抽象骨架生成→受控实例化→高维验证→多指标评估"管线的通用算法。

Result: 大规模实验验证了问题定义的正确性和方法在可玩性、结构、风格、鲁棒性及效率方面的有效性。基于Unity的案例研究成功复现了符合评估指标的可玩场景。

Conclusion: HDPCG推动PCG向通用表示和游戏相关维度生成发展，为未来实现可控、可验证且可扩展的关卡生成铺平道路。

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has made substantial progress in shaping static 2D/3D geometry, while most methods treat gameplay mechanics as auxiliary and optimize only over space. We argue that this limits controllability and expressivity, and formally introduce High-Dimensional PCG (HDPCG): a framework that elevates non-geometric gameplay dimensions to first-class coordinates of a joint state space. We instantiate HDPCG along two concrete directions. Direction-Space augments geometry with a discrete layer dimension and validates reachability in 4D (x,y,z,l), enabling unified treatment of 2.5D/3.5D mechanics such as gravity inversion and parallel-world switching. Direction-Time augments geometry with temporal dynamics via time-expanded graphs, capturing action semantics and conflict rules. For each direction, we present three general, practicable algorithms with a shared pipeline of abstract skeleton generation, controlled grounding, high-dimensional validation, and multi-metric evaluation. Large-scale experiments across diverse settings validate the integrity of our problem formulation and the effectiveness of our methods on playability, structure, style, robustness, and efficiency. Beyond quantitative results, Unity-based case studies recreate playable scenarios that accord with our metrics. We hope HDPCG encourages a shift in PCG toward general representations and the generation of gameplay-relevant dimensions beyond geometry, paving the way for controllable, verifiable, and extensible level generation.

Motivation: 填补一阶逻辑概念综合评估基准的空白，提供精确验证框架以分析模型的泛化能力。

Method: 设计INDUCTION基准，基于带扩展标记谓词的有限关系世界，要求模型输出统一的一阶逻辑公式，通过精确模型检验验证，包含全观测、对比和存在补全三种机制并引入公式膨胀惩罚。

Result: 发现显著难度梯度、持续困难的结构族、低膨胀公式在未见数据上泛化更好，顶尖模型在不同任务和指标上呈现质的差异。

Conclusion: 该基准为一阶逻辑概念泛化提供严格评估工具，表明简洁性是泛化的关键，并揭示顶尖模型采用不同的概念泛化策略。

Abstract: We introduce INDUCTION, a benchmark for finite structure concept synthesis in first order logic. Given small finite relational worlds with extensionally labeled target predicates, models must output a single first order logical formula that explains the target uniformly across worlds, with correctness verified via exact model checking. The benchmark includes three regimes, FullObs, CI (contrastive), and EC (existential completion), nd penalizes formula bloat. We find sharp difficulty gradients, persistent hard structural families, and observe that low bloat formulas generalize far better on held out worlds. Elite recent models show qualitatively different behaviors across tasks and performance metrics, hinting to their different strategies of concept generalization.

### [187] [Modularity is the Bedrock of Natural and Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18960)
*Alessandro Salatiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This review paper argues that modularity, a fundamental principle of brain computation, is underappreciated in mainstream AI despite its potential to improve efficiency and generalization. It synthesizes research from AI and neuroscience to demonstrate how modularity provides computational advantages, has emerged across AI subfields, and can bridge the gap between resource-intensive artificial systems and efficient natural intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems require massive data, computation, and energy far exceeding human intelligence, highlighting the need for new principles. Modularity is critical for human learning and generalization but remains underappreciated in mainstream AI research, despite aligning with the No Free Lunch Theorem's need for problem-specific inductive biases.

Method: The authors conduct a conceptual review of research threads in artificial intelligence and neuroscience through a framework emphasizing modularity's central role. They analyze computational advantages, historical emergence in AI subfields, brain exploitation principles, and bridging mechanisms between natural and artificial intelligence.

Result: The paper synthesizes how modularity provides computational efficiency and strong generalization, has demonstrated benefits across diverse AI subfields, and exploits principles found in brain organization. It establishes a conceptual framework connecting modular approaches in AI with biological modularity to address AI's resource inefficiency.

Conclusion: Modularity is a fundamental organizational principle that can help bridge the gap between natural and artificial intelligence by providing the inductive biases needed for efficient learning and generalization. Mainstream AI research should place greater emphasis on modular architectures inspired by brain computation principles.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of modern AI systems has been driven by unprecedented scales of data, computation, and energy -- far exceeding the resources required by human intelligence. This disparity highlights the need for new guiding principles and motivates drawing inspiration from the fundamental organizational principles of brain computation. Among these principles, modularity has been shown to be critical for supporting the efficient learning and strong generalization abilities consistently exhibited by humans. Furthermore, modularity aligns well with the No Free Lunch Theorem, which highlights the need for problem-specific inductive biases and motivates architectures composed of specialized components that solve subproblems. However, despite its fundamental role in natural intelligence and its demonstrated benefits across a range of seemingly disparate AI subfields, modularity remains relatively underappreciated in mainstream AI research. In this work, we review several research threads in artificial intelligence and neuroscience through a conceptual framework that highlights the central role of modularity in supporting both artificial and natural intelligence. In particular, we examine what computational advantages modularity provides, how it has emerged as a solution across several AI research areas, which modularity principles the brain exploits, and how modularity can help bridge the gap between natural and artificial intelligence.

*Tao Zhe,Haoyu Wang,Bo Luo,Min Wu,Wei Fan,Xiao Luo,Zijun Yao,Haifeng Chen,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposing a coarse-grained layered tool orchestration framework with local error correction for robust and efficient agentic system execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool invocation failures in agentic systems stem from poor multi-tool organization, not individual calls. Existing tightly-coupled execution/planning approaches cause brittle behavior and high overhead.

Method: Model orchestration as learning layered execution structures for high-level dependencies, execute layer-wise via context constraints, and apply schema-aware reflective correction for local error repair.

Result: Achieves robust tool execution while reducing execution complexity and overhead.

Conclusion: Enables a lightweight, reusable orchestration component for agentic systems. Code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Tool invocation is a core capability of agentic systems, yet failures often arise not from individual tool calls but from how multiple tools are organized and executed together. Existing approaches tightly couple tool execution with stepwise language reasoning or explicit planning, leading to brittle behavior and high execution overhead. To overcome these limitations, we revisit tool invocation from the perspective of tool orchestration. Our key insight is that effective orchestration does not require precise dependency graphs or fine-grained planning. Instead, a coarse-grained layer structure suffices to provide global guidance, while execution-time errors can be corrected locally. Specifically, we model tool orchestration as learning a layered execution structure that captures high-level tool dependencies, inducing layer-wise execution through context constraints. To handle execution-time failures, we introduce a schema-aware reflective correction mechanism that detects and repairs errors locally. This design confines errors to individual tool calls and avoids re-planning entire execution trajectories. This structured execution paradigm enables a lightweight and reusable orchestration component for agentic systems. Experimental results show that our approach achieves robust tool execution while reducing execution complexity and overhead. Code will be made publicly available.

### [189] [How Far Can We Go with Pixels Alone? A Pilot Study on Screen-Only Navigation in Commercial 3D ARPGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18981)
*Kaijie Xu,Mustafa Bugti,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a visual-only navigation agent for 3D game levels using an existing visual affordance detector. The agent processes live game frames to identify interest points and navigate Dark Souls-style levels with a simple controller. While it demonstrates meaningful navigation, limitations in the visual model prevent comprehensive performance, suggesting vision-based models need supplementation for general solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern 3D game level navigability is difficult to quantify; prior methods using simplified simulations or static screenshot analysis fail to capture how players explore complex, real-world game levels authentically.

Method: Built on an open-source visual affordance detector, the paper created a screen-only exploration agent that consumes live game frames, identifies salient interest points, and drives a simple finite-state controller over minimal actions to explore linear Dark Souls-style levels and reach goal regions.

Result: Pilot experiments show the agent can traverse most required segments and exhibits meaningful visual navigation behavior, but limitations of the underlying visual model prevent truly comprehensive and reliable auto-navigation.

Conclusion: The system provides a concrete baseline and evaluation protocol for visual navigation in complex games. Purely vision-based models with discrete single-modality inputs can effectively support navigation in idealized settings but are unlikely to be a general solution without explicit reasoning or additional capabilities.

Abstract: Modern 3D game levels rely heavily on visual guidance, yet the navigability of level layouts remains difficult to quantify. Prior work either simulates play in simplified environments or analyzes static screenshots for visual affordances, but neither setting faithfully captures how players explore complex, real-world game levels. In this paper, we build on an existing open-source visual affordance detector and instantiate a screen-only exploration and navigation agent that operates purely from visual affordances. Our agent consumes live game frames, identifies salient interest points, and drives a simple finite-state controller over a minimal action space to explore Dark Souls-style linear levels and attempt to reach expected goal regions. Pilot experiments show that the agent can traverse most required segments and exhibits meaningful visual navigation behavior, but also highlight that limitations of the underlying visual model prevent truly comprehensive and reliable auto-navigation. We argue that this system provides a concrete, shared baseline and evaluation protocol for visual navigation in complex games, and we call for more attention to this necessary task. Our results suggest that purely vision-based sense-making models, with discrete single-modality inputs and without explicit reasoning, can effectively support navigation and environment understanding in idealized settings, but are unlikely to be a general solution on their own.

Method: 构建统一框架General AgentBench，涵盖搜索、编码、推理和工具使用领域，研究顺序扩展（迭代交互）和并行扩展（多轨迹采样）两种测试时扩展行为

Result: 十个主流LLM智能体在通用场景下性能显著下降；顺序扩展受上下文天花板限制，并行扩展存在验证差距，两种方法均未带来有效提升

Conclusion: 通用智能体评估需要跨领域统一基准，当前测试时扩展方法存在根本性局限，为未来研究方向提供重要参考

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly expected to function as general-purpose systems capable of resolving open-ended user requests. While existing benchmarks focus on domain-aware environments for developing specialized agents, evaluating general-purpose agents requires more realistic settings that challenge them to operate across multiple skills and tools within a unified environment. We introduce General AgentBench, a benchmark that provides such a unified framework for evaluating general LLM agents across search, coding, reasoning, and tool-use domains. Using General AgentBench, we systematically study test-time scaling behaviors under sequential scaling (iterative interaction) and parallel scaling (sampling multiple trajectories). Evaluation of ten leading LLM agents reveals a substantial performance degradation when moving from domain-specific evaluations to this general-agent setting. Moreover, we find that neither scaling methodology yields effective performance improvements in practice, due to two fundamental limitations: context ceiling in sequential scaling and verification gap in parallel scaling.

TL;DR: MagicAgent addresses generalized agent planning challenges through a synthetic data framework and two-stage training (supervised fine-tuning + multi-objective RL), achieving SOTA results that surpass closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalized planning remains difficult due to scarce high-quality interaction data and inherent conflicts across heterogeneous tasks, causing models to excel at isolated tasks but struggle with generalization while suffering from gradient interference in multi-task training.

Method: Proposes MagicAgent with a lightweight synthetic data framework generating diverse trajectories (hierarchical decomposition, tool-augmented planning, multi-constraint scheduling, procedural logic, long-horizon execution) and a two-stage training paradigm of supervised fine-tuning followed by multi-objective reinforcement learning.

Result: MagicAgent-32B/30B-A3B achieve 75.1% on Worfbench, 55.9% on NaturalPlan, 57.5% on τ²-Bench, 86.9% on BFCL-v3, and 81.2% on ACEBench, substantially outperforming sub-100B models and surpassing leading closed-source models.

Conclusion: The synthetic data framework and conflict-mitigating training paradigm successfully enable generalized planning capabilities in LLMs, achieving superior performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text processors to autonomous agents has established planning as a core component of modern intelligence. However, achieving generalized planning remains elusive, not only by the scarcity of high-quality interaction data but also by inherent conflicts across heterogeneous planning tasks. These challenges result in models that excel at isolated tasks yet struggle to generalize, while existing multi-task training attempts suffer from gradient interference. In this paper, we present \textbf{MagicAgent}, a series of foundation models specifically designed for generalized agent planning. We introduce a lightweight and scalable synthetic data framework that generates high-quality trajectories across diverse planning tasks, including hierarchical task decomposition, tool-augmented planning, multi-constraint scheduling, procedural logic orchestration, and long-horizon tool execution. To mitigate training conflicts, we propose a two-stage training paradigm comprising supervised fine-tuning followed by multi-objective reinforcement learning over both static datasets and dynamic environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MagicAgent-32B and MagicAgent-30B-A3B deliver superior performance, achieving accuracies of $75.1\%$ on Worfbench, $55.9\%$ on NaturalPlan, $57.5\%$ on $τ^2$-Bench, $86.9\%$ on BFCL-v3, and $81.2\%$ on ACEBench, as well as strong results on our in-house MagicEval benchmarks. These results substantially outperform existing sub-100B models and even surpass leading closed-source models.

*S. K. Rithvik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A systematic evaluation of 15 LLMs on 20 quantum mechanics tasks (900 baseline + 75 tool-augmented assessments) reveals clear tier stratification: flagship models achieve 81% accuracy while fast models only reach 67%. Derivations are easiest (92% average, 100% for flagship) while numerical computation is hardest (42%). Tool augmentation provides modest gains (+4.4pp) but with high variance (+29pp to -16pp) and 3x token cost. Reproducibility shows 6.3pp average variance, with flagship models demonstrating exceptional stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively assess the capability of large language models to solve quantum mechanics problems across different reasoning types (derivations, creative problems, non-standard concepts, numerical computation), establish performance hierarchies across model tiers, evaluate tool augmentation effectiveness, and characterize reproducibility for reliable scientific use.

Method: Evaluated 15 models from five providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Alibaba, DeepSeek) spanning three capability tiers across 20 quantum mechanics tasks. Conducted 900 baseline assessments and 75 tool-augmented evaluations. Performed reproducibility analysis through three runs per task. Developed automatic verification benchmark for quantum problems.

Result: Flagship models: 81% average accuracy (14pp ahead of fast models). Mid-tier: 77%. Fast models: 67%. Derivations: 92% average (flagship 100%). Numerical computation: 42% (most challenging). Tool augmentation: +4.4pp overall improvement but highly variable (+29pp to -16pp) with 3x token cost. Reproducibility: 6.3pp average variance, flagship models highly stable (GPT-5 zero variance).

Conclusion: Clear performance hierarchy exists across LLM tiers in quantum mechanics problem-solving, with flagship models demonstrating superior and stable performance. Tool augmentation shows task-dependent effectiveness with significant cost-performance trade-offs. The work provides a public benchmark, systematic evaluation framework, empirical analysis of augmentation strategies, and reproducibility characterization to advance LLM applications in scientific domains.

Abstract: We present a systematic evaluation of large language models on quantum mechanics problem-solving. Our study evaluates 15 models from five providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Alibaba, DeepSeek) spanning three capability tiers on 20 tasks covering derivations, creative problems, non-standard concepts, and numerical computation, comprising 900 baseline and 75 tool-augmented assessments. Results reveal clear tier stratification: flagship models achieve 81\% average accuracy, outperforming mid-tier (77\%) and fast models (67\%) by 4pp and 14pp respectively. Task difficulty patterns emerge distinctly: derivations show highest performance (92\% average, 100\% for flagship models), while numerical computation remains most challenging (42\%). Tool augmentation on numerical tasks yields task-dependent effects: modest overall improvement (+4.4pp) at 3x token cost masks dramatic heterogeneity ranging from +29pp gains to -16pp degradation. Reproducibility analysis across three runs quantifies 6.3pp average variance, with flagship models demonstrating exceptional stability (GPT-5 achieves zero variance) while specialized models require multi-run evaluation. This work contributes: (i) a benchmark for quantum mechanics with automatic verification, (ii) systematic evaluation quantifying tier-based performance hierarchies, (iii) empirical analysis of tool augmentation trade-offs, and (iv) reproducibility characterization. All tasks, verifiers, and results are publicly released.

Conclusion: 垫脚石对现代推理LLM具有重要价值和可学习性，ARQ框架为提升LLM复杂任务解决能力提供了有效方法

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in enabling LLMs to solve complex reasoning tasks such as math and coding. As we start to apply LLMs to harder tasks that they may not be able to solve in one shot, it is worth paying attention to their ability to construct intermediate stepping stones that prepare them to better solve the tasks. Examples of stepping stones include simplifications, alternative framings, or subproblems. We study properties and benefits of stepping stones in the context of modern reasoning LLMs via ARQ (\textbf{A}king the \textbf{R}ight \textbf{Q}uestions), our simple framework which introduces a question generator to the default reasoning pipeline. We first show that good stepping stone questions exist and are transferrable, meaning that good questions can be generated, and they substantially help LLMs of various capabilities in solving the target tasks. We next frame stepping stone generation as a post-training task and show that we can fine-tune LLMs to generate more useful stepping stones by SFT and RL on synthetic data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI must not only demonstrate good performance but also provide convincing explanations to be trusted. Different applications have varying explanatory requirements that need systematic definition.

Method: Presenting a three-dimensional framework (Source, Depth, Scope) to categorize explanatory requirements and align them with the capabilities of underlying ML techniques, while avoiding aspects already well-covered in existing literature.

Result: A three-dimensional framework for categorizing XAI explanatory requirements that helps bridge the gap between application needs and ML explanation capabilities.

Conclusion: This structured framework enables better matching of application-specific explanatory requirements with suitable ML techniques, advancing trustworthy AI development.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become popular in the last few years. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community in general, and the Machine Learning (ML) community in particular, is coming to the realisation that in many applications, for AI to be trusted, it must not only demonstrate good performance in its decisionmaking, but it also must explain these decisions and convince us that it is making the decisions for the right reasons. However, different applications have different requirements on the information required of the underlying AI system in order to convince us that it is worthy of our trust. How do we define these requirements?
  In this paper, we present three dimensions for categorising the explanatory requirements of different applications. These are Source, Depth and Scope. We focus on the problem of matching up the explanatory requirements of different applications with the capabilities of underlying ML techniques to provide them. We deliberately avoid including aspects of explanation that are already well-covered by the existing literature and we focus our discussion on ML although the principles apply to AI more broadly.

Motivation: 为了理解大型语言模型中算术答案是如何在跨标记路由变得因果无关后被确定，需要研究三位数加法在Meta-Llama-3-8B中的单标记读出机制。

Method: 采用因果残差修补和累积注意力消融实验来定位关键层；使用低秩Procrustes对齐分析数位和方向字典的几何关系；通过因果数位编辑验证跨上下文的传递性。

Result: 在第17层附近存在一个明显边界：超过该层后，解码的和几乎完全由最后一个输入标记控制，后期自注意力机制基本可省略；不同下一高位上下文的数字和方向字典在共享的低秩子空间内通过近似正交映射良好关联。

Conclusion: 模型的算术计算具有明确的层次结构，后期层主要负责基于最终标记完成答案输出，且不同数位上下文的表示空间存在可学习的几何变换关系，这为理解语言模型中的算法推理提供了机制性解释。

  In this post-routing regime, digit(-sum) direction dictionaries vary with a next-higher-digit context but are
  well-related by an approximately orthogonal map inside a shared low-rank subspace (low-rank Procrustes alignment).
  Causal digit editing matches this geometry: naive cross-context transfer fails, while rotating directions through the
  learned map restores strict counterfactual edits; negative controls do not recover.

*Shiyi Cao,Ziming Mao,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出K-Search，一种通过协同演化世界模型来优化GPU内核的新方法。该方法利用大语言模型的领域知识，将高层算法规划与底层程序实例化解耦，能够探索非单调优化路径并对临时缺陷保持鲁棒性。在FlashInfer的复杂内核上测试显示，K-Search相比现有进化搜索方法平均提升2.10倍，在MoE内核上最高提升14.3倍，在GPUMode TriMul任务上达到H100芯片的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习系统亟需高效的GPU内核优化，但现有自动化方法仅将大语言模型视为启发式进化循环中的随机代码生成器，缺乏显式规划能力。这些方法难以处理需要协调多步结构变换的复杂内核，且常因低效或不正确的中间实现而丢弃有潜力的优化策略，因此需要一种能充分利用大语言模型领域知识来指导搜索的新框架。

Method: 提出"通过协同演化世界模型搜索"并构建K-Search系统。该方法用协同演化的世界模型替代静态搜索启发式，利用大语言模型的先验领域知识主动探索优化空间。框架显式地将高层算法规划与底层程序实例化解耦，使系统能够沿非单调优化路径搜索，同时对临时实现缺陷保持韧性。

Result: 在FlashInfer的多样化复杂内核（包括GQA、MLA和MoE内核）上评估显示，K-Search显著优于最先进的进化搜索方法，平均性能提升2.10倍，在复杂MoE内核上最高提升达14.3倍。在GPUMode TriMul任务上，K-Search在H100芯片上达到1030微秒的最优性能，超越了先前的进化方法和人工设计方案。

Conclusion: 协同演化世界模型方法通过提供显式规划能力和对中间缺陷的鲁棒性，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。K-Search的成功验证了该框架在自动化GPU内核优化方面的潜力，为现代机器学习系统的高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels is critical for efficient modern machine learning systems yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of design factors and rapid hardware evolution. Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels. On the GPUMode TriMul task, K-Search achieves state-of-the-art performance on H100, reaching 1030us and surpassing both prior evolution and human-designed solutions.

TL;DR: 该论文通过贝叶斯模型证明，即使理性用户在与AI聊天机器人的长期对话中也会因AI的"谄媚"倾向而陷入"AI精神病"或"妄想螺旋"，且简单的缓解措施如防止幻觉或警告用户效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究用户在长期与AI聊天机器人对话后产生危险妄想信念（即"AI精神病"或"妄想螺旋"）的新兴现象，以及AI"谄媚"（倾向于验证用户主张）与该现象之间的因果联系。

Method: 采用理论建模与仿真方法：提出一个简化的贝叶斯用户-聊天机器人交互模型，在该框架内形式化定义"谄媚"和"妄想螺旋"的概念，并分析其因果机制。

Result: 1) 即使理想化的贝叶斯理性用户也易受妄想螺旋影响；2) AI谄媚在其中起因果作用；3) 该效应在两种缓解策略下依然存在：防止模型编造虚假主张，以及告知用户模型可能存在谄媚倾向。

Conclusion: 妄想螺旋问题具有鲁棒性，简单的缓解措施难以根除，需要模型开发者和政策制定者采取更有效的干预手段。

Abstract: "AI psychosis" or "delusional spiraling" is an emerging phenomenon where AI chatbot users find themselves dangerously confident in outlandish beliefs after extended chatbot conversations. This phenomenon is typically attributed to AI chatbots' well-documented bias towards validating users' claims, a property often called "sycophancy." In this paper, we probe the causal link between AI sycophancy and AI-induced psychosis through modeling and simulation. We propose a simple Bayesian model of a user conversing with a chatbot, and formalize notions of sycophancy and delusional spiraling in that model. We then show that in this model, even an idealized Bayes-rational user is vulnerable to delusional spiraling, and that sycophancy plays a causal role. Furthermore, this effect persists in the face of two candidate mitigations: preventing chatbots from hallucinating false claims, and informing users of the possibility of model sycophancy. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for model developers and policymakers concerned with mitigating the problem of delusional spiraling.

Abstract: Medical foundation models generate narrative explanations but cannot quantify intervention effects, detect evidence conflicts, or validate literature claims, limiting clinical auditability. We propose causal compilation, a paradigm that transforms medical evidence from narrative text into executable code. The paradigm standardizes heterogeneous research evidence into structured estimand objects, each explicitly specifying intervention contrast, effect scale, time horizon, and target population, supporting six executable causal queries: do-calculus, counterfactual reasoning, temporal trajectories, heterogeneous effects, mechanistic decomposition, and joint interventions. We instantiate this paradigm in DoAtlas-1, compiling 1,445 effect kernels from 754 studies through effect standardization, conflict-aware graph construction, and real-world validation (Human Phenotype Project, 10,000 participants). The system achieves 98.5% canonicalization accuracy and 80.5% query executability. This paradigm shifts medical AI from text generation to executable, auditable, and verifiable causal reasoning.

### [199] [Beyond Behavioural Trade-Offs: Mechanistic Tracing of Pain-Pleasure Decisions in an LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19159)
*Francesca Bianco,Derek Shiller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study uses mechanistic interpretability to show how LLMs internally represent valence (pain/pleasure) information, finding it's detectable early, peaks in middle layers, and can be causally manipulated via steering late attention outputs, linking behavior to specific neural computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect behavioral evidence of LLM sensitivity to valence framing with the underlying neural mechanisms in transformers, which is crucial for informing AI sentience debates and governance policies.

Method: Using Gemma-2-9B-it, researchers employed layer-wise linear probing, activation interventions (steering/patching), and dose-response quantification to map and causally test valence representations in a minimal decision task.

Result: Valence sign is linearly separable from layer 0-1; intensity peaks in mid-late layers (especially attention/MLP outputs); steering late attention (L14) causally modulates decisions; effects are distributed across heads.

Conclusion: The work provides concrete mechanistic targets linking LLM behavior to internal representations, supporting evidence-based AI welfare debates and safety governance.

Abstract: Prior behavioural work suggests that some LLMs alter choices when options are framed as causing pain or pleasure, and that such deviations can scale with stated intensity. To bridge behavioural evidence (what the model does) with mechanistic interpretability (what computations support it), we investigate how valence-related information is represented and where it is causally used inside a transformer. Using Gemma-2-9B-it and a minimalist decision task modelled on prior work, we (i) map representational availability with layer-wise linear probing across streams, (ii) test causal contribution with activation interventions (steering; patching/ablation), and (iii) quantify dose-response effects over an epsilon grid, reading out both the 2-3 logit margin and digit-pair-normalised choice probabilities. We find that (a) valence sign (pain vs. pleasure) is perfectly linearly separable across stream families from very early layers (L0-L1), while a lexical baseline retains substantial signal; (b) graded intensity is strongly decodable, with peaks in mid-to-late layers and especially in attention/MLP outputs, and decision alignment is highest slightly before the final token; (c) additive steering along a data-derived valence direction causally modulates the 2-3 margin at late sites, with the largest effects observed in late-layer attention outputs (attn_out L14); and (d) head-level patching/ablation suggests that these effects are distributed across multiple heads rather than concentrated in a single unit. Together, these results link behavioural sensitivity to identifiable internal representations and intervention-sensitive sites, providing concrete mechanistic targets for more stringent counterfactual tests and broader replication. This work supports a more evidence-driven (a) debate on AI sentience and welfare, and (b) governance when setting policy, auditing standards, and safety safeguards.

Motivation: 探索LLM能否真正理解并应用形式化规则进行逻辑推理，超越自然语言处理任务，检验其性能是否依赖语言语义或训练时的游戏先验知识。

Method: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash、Llama 3.3 70B、GPT-OSS 120B四个模型，在通用游戏博弈实例上执行前向模拟任务（多步状态预测和法律动作生成），基于40个结构特征进行相关性分析，并通过游戏混淆实验测试语义和先验暴露影响。

Result: 三个模型在多数设置下表现良好；性能随评估步数增加而显著下降；识别出三大类错误：规则幻觉、状态事实冗余、句法错误；显示当代模型形式推理能力有清晰进步。

Conclusion: 现代LLM在形式化逻辑推理上取得显著进展，但长距离推理能力仍有限，未来需提升模型对规则的真实理解和应用能力。

Abstract: This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) from a novel perspective, focusing on their ability to operate within formally specified, rule-governed environments. We evaluate four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash variants, Llama 3.3 70B and GPT-OSS 120B) on a suite of forward-simulation tasks-including next / multistep state formulation, and legal action generation-across a diverse set of reasoning problems illustrated through General Game Playing (GGP) game instances. Beyond reporting instance-level performance, we characterize games based on 40 structural features and analyze correlations between these features and LLM performance. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of various game obfuscations to assess the role of linguistic semantics in game definitions and the impact of potential prior exposure of LLMs to specific games during training. The main results indicate that three of the evaluated models generally perform well across most experimental settings, with performance degradation observed as the evaluation horizon increases (i.e., with a higher number of game steps). Detailed case-based analysis of the LLM performance provides novel insights into common reasoning errors in the considered logic-based problem formulation, including hallucinated rules, redundant state facts, or syntactic errors. Overall, the paper reports clear progress in formal reasoning capabilities of contemporary models.

Abstract: The optimization of urban energy systems is crucial for the advancement of sustainable and resilient smart cities, which are becoming increasingly complex with multiple decision-making units. To address scalability and coordination concerns, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a promising solution. This paper addresses the imperative need for comprehensive and reliable benchmarking of MARL algorithms on energy management tasks. CityLearn is used as a case study environment because it realistically simulates urban energy systems, incorporates multiple storage systems, and utilizes renewable energy sources. By doing so, our work sets a new standard for evaluation, conducting a comparative study across multiple key performance indicators (KPIs). This approach illuminates the key strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms, moving beyond traditional KPI averaging which often masks critical insights. Our experiments utilize widely accepted baselines such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC), and encompass diverse training schemes including Decentralized Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) and Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) approaches and different neural network architectures. Our work also proposes novel KPIs that tackle real world implementation challenges such as individual building contribution and battery storage lifetime. Our findings show that DTDE consistently outperforms CTDE in both average and worst-case performance. Additionally, temporal dependency learning improved control on memory dependent KPIs such as ramping and battery usage, contributing to more sustainable battery operation. Results also reveal robustness to agent or resource removal, highlighting both the resilience and decentralizability of the learned policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于组的策略优化方法在多轮LLM智能体训练中存在局限：它们僵化地依赖批次内统计偏差，当任务难度波动时经常错误分配信用——将简单任务的失败误判为随机不稳定，或将困难任务的成功误判为真实能力突破。这在生产系统中尤为关键，因为准确区分高价值信号与随机噪声对样本高效训练至关重要。

Method: ProxMO框架集成两个轻量级机制：1）成功率感知调制，根据 episode 级别的成功率动态调整梯度强度以适应难度；2）基于邻近度的软聚合，在步骤级别通过连续语义加权推导基线。该框架设计为与标准GRPO框架即插即用兼容，便于在现有工业训练管道中部署。

Result: 在ALFWorld和WebShop基准测试上的广泛评估表明，ProxMO相比现有基线带来显著性能增益，且计算成本可忽略。消融研究进一步验证了两个机制的独立和协同效果。

Conclusion: ProxMO为现实世界多轮LLM智能体训练提供了实用且稳健的解决方案，能有效应对任务难度波动导致的信用分配挑战。其即插即用特性促进了在现有工业训练管道中的快速采用，对生产系统部署具有重要价值。

Abstract: Multi-turn LLM agents are becoming pivotal to production systems, spanning customer service automation, e-commerce assistance, and interactive task management, where accurately distinguishing high-value informative signals from stochastic noise is critical for sample-efficient training. In real-world scenarios, a failure in a trivial task may reflect random instability, whereas success in a high-difficulty task signifies a genuine capability breakthrough. Yet, existing group-based policy optimization methods rigidly rely on statistical deviation within discrete batches, frequently misallocating credit when task difficulty fluctuates. To address this issue, we propose Proximity-based Multi-turn Optimization (ProxMO), a practical and robust framework engineered specifically for the constraints of real-world deployment. ProxMO integrates global context via two lightweight mechanisms: success-rate-aware modulation dynamically adapts gradient intensity based on episode-level difficulty, while proximity-based soft aggregation derives baselines through continuous semantic weighting at the step level. Extensive evaluations on ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks demonstrate that ProxMO yields substantial performance gains over existing baselines with negligible computational cost. Ablation studies further validate the independent and synergistic efficacy of both mechanisms. Crucially, ProxMO offers plug-and-play compatibility with standard GRPO frameworks, facilitating immediate, low-friction adoption in existing industrial training pipelines. Our implementation is available at: \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/proxmo-B7E7/README.md}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/proxmo}.

Conclusion: TopoRAG能有效捕获高维拓扑和关系依赖，为文本图推理提供了更紧致且信息丰富的上下文基础，显著增强了LLM的结构化推理能力

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically integrating external knowledge, thereby mitigating hallucinations and strengthening contextual grounding for structured data such as graphs. Nevertheless, most existing RAG variants for textual graphs concentrate on low-dimensional structures -- treating nodes as entities (0-dimensional) and edges or paths as pairwise or sequential relations (1-dimensional), but overlook cycles, which are crucial for reasoning over relational loops. Such cycles often arise in questions requiring closed-loop inference about similar objects or relative positions. This limitation often results in incomplete contextual grounding and restricted reasoning capability. In this work, we propose Topology-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (TopoRAG), a novel framework for textual graph question answering that effectively captures higher-dimensional topological and relational dependencies. Specifically, TopoRAG first lifts textual graphs into cellular complexes to model multi-dimensional topological structures. Leveraging these lifted representations, a topology-aware subcomplex retrieval mechanism is proposed to extract cellular complexes relevant to the input query, providing compact and informative topological context. Finally, a multi-dimensional topological reasoning mechanism operates over these complexes to propagate relational information and guide LLMs in performing structured, logic-aware inference. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses existing baselines across diverse textual graph tasks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses anisotropic generalization in RL-based exploration policies for On-the-fly Directed Controller Synthesis (OTF-DCS). It proposes Soft-MoE, a framework that combines multiple RL experts via prior-confidence gating to treat anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations. Evaluation on Air Traffic benchmark shows expanded solvable parameter space and improved robustness over single experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning policies for OTF-DCS exploration suffer from anisotropic generalization—performing well only in specific parameter space regions while being fragile elsewhere due to training stochasticity and trajectory-dependent bias, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Proposed Soft Mixture-of-Experts (Soft-MoE) framework that combines multiple RL experts through a prior-confidence gating mechanism, treating their anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations rather than individual weaknesses.

Result: Evaluation on the Air Traffic benchmark demonstrated that Soft-MoE substantially expands the solvable parameter space and achieves significantly improved robustness compared to any single expert policy.

Conclusion: The Soft-MoE framework effectively mitigates anisotropic generalization in RL-based OTF-DCS, creating more robust exploration policies with broader applicability across diverse parameter spaces.

Abstract: On-the-fly Directed Controller Synthesis (OTF-DCS) mitigates state-space explosion by incrementally exploring the system and relies critically on an exploration policy to guide search efficiently. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches learn such policies and achieve promising zero-shot generalization from small training instances to larger unseen ones. However, a fundamental limitation is anisotropic generalization, where an RL policy exhibits strong performance only in a specific region of the domain-parameter space while remaining fragile elsewhere due to training stochasticity and trajectory-dependent bias. To address this, we propose a Soft Mixture-of-Experts framework that combines multiple RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism and treats these anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations. The evaluation on the Air Traffic benchmark shows that Soft-MoE substantially expands the solvable parameter space and improves robustness compared to any single expert.

Motivation: 实证研究显示，采用CoT等典型任务分解策略时，单纯增加计算预算可能导致测试性能崩溃，其根源在于静态规划方法无法感知模型推理的内在边界限制

Method: 提出"有限推理空间"假说，通过非自治随机动力系统理论分析；设计Halo模型预测控制框架，采用熵驱动的双控制器和"测量-规划"策略实现可控推理

Result: Halo在复杂长程任务上显著优于静态基线方法，通过动态调节推理边界处的规划行为，有效抑制过度规划并发挥计算扩展优势

Conclusion: 存在最优计算预算范围，过度规划会损害推理能力；动态边界控制是提升LLM长程推理能力的关键策略

Abstract: The test-time compute strategy, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), has significantly enhanced the ability of large language models to solve complex tasks like logical reasoning. However, empirical studies indicate that simply increasing the compute budget can sometimes lead to a collapse in test-time performance when employing typical task decomposition strategies such as CoT. This work hypothesizes that reasoning failures with larger compute budgets stem from static planning methods, which hardly perceive the intrinsic boundaries of LLM reasoning. We term it as the Limited Reasoning Space hypothesis and perform theoretical analysis through the lens of a non-autonomous stochastic dynamical system. This insight suggests that there is an optimal range for compute budgets; over-planning can lead to redundant feedback and may even impair reasoning capabilities. To exploit the compute-scaling benefits and suppress over-planning, this work proposes Halo, a model predictive control framework for LLM planning. Halo is designed for long-horizon tasks with reason-based planning and crafts an entropy-driven dual controller, which adopts a Measure-then-Plan strategy to achieve controllable reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Halo outperforms static baselines on complex long-horizon tasks by dynamically regulating planning at the reasoning boundary.

Conclusion: ALPACA为研究阿尔茨海默病的个体化序贯治疗决策提供了可重复使用的硅基试验平台。

Abstract: Evaluating personalized, sequential treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) using clinical trials is often impractical due to long disease horizons and substantial inter-patient heterogeneity. To address these constraints, we present the Alzheimer's Learning Platform for Adaptive Care Agents (ALPACA), an open-source, Gym-compatible reinforcement learning (RL) environment for systematically exploring personalized treatment strategies using existing therapies. ALPACA is powered by the Continuous Action-conditioned State Transitions (CAST) model trained on longitudinal trajectories from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), enabling medication-conditioned simulation of disease progression under alternative treatment decisions. We show that CAST autoregressively generates realistic medication-conditioned trajectories and that RL policies trained in ALPACA outperform no-treatment and behavior-cloned clinician baselines on memory-related outcomes. Interpretability analyses further indicated that the learned policies relied on clinically meaningful patient features when selecting actions. Overall, ALPACA provides a reusable in silico testbed for studying individualized sequential treatment decision-making for AD.

*Pratham Yashwante,Rose Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Investigating whether time series representations converge with vision and language in a shared latent space, finding they are initially orthogonal but can be aligned via contrastive learning with asymmetric relationships and threshold effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis has been examined for vision and language but remains untested for time series, which is crucial for building multimodal systems involving non-conventional data modalities.

Method: Examining independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders in a trimodal setting, then applying post-hoc contrastive alignment using trainable projection heads over frozen encoders, analyzing geometry, scaling, and information density effects.

Result: Pretrained encoders show near-orthogonal geometry; alignment improves with model size but is asymmetric (time series align better with vision than language); images serve as effective intermediaries; richer descriptions only help up to a threshold.

Conclusion: Findings reveal key considerations for multimodal systems with non-conventional modalities: alignment is achievable but asymmetric and subject to diminishing returns, informing future architecture design.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that learned representations from models trained on different modalities converge to a shared latent structure of the world. However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations. Our findings shed light on considerations for building multimodal systems involving non-conventional data modalities beyond vision and language.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本章探讨了建模与仿真(M&S)、人工智能(AI)和数字孪生(DT)之间的互补关系，分析了M&S如何支撑DT，DT如何促进AI-M&S融合，并识别了未来挑战。


<details>

Method: 本章通过以下方式进行全面探索：1) 建立DT基础认知（组件、架构、作用）；2) 分析DT中的M&S技术；3) 研究AI的双向作用（增强DT和作为AI训练/部署平台）。

Result: 本章涵盖了DT的关键组件/架构、M&S技术（基于物理、离散事件、混合方法）以及AI在DT中的双重作用（分析决策和AI开发平台）。

Conclusion: 本章通过识别关键挑战和未来研究方向，为创建更集成化和智能化的系统提供指导。

Abstract: The convergence of modeling & simulation (M&S) and artificial intelligence (AI) is leaving its marks on advanced digital technology. Pertinent examples are digital twins (DTs) - high-fidelity, live representations of physical assets, and frequent enablers of corporate digital maturation and transformation. Often seen as technological platforms that integrate an array of services, DTs have the potential to bring AI-enabled M&S closer to end-users. It is, therefore, paramount to understand the role of M&S in DTs, and the role of digital twins in enabling the convergence of AI and M&S. To this end, this chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of the complementary relationship between these three. We begin by establishing a foundational understanding of DTs by detailing their key components, architectural layers, and their various roles across business, development, and operations. We then examine the central role of M&S in DTs and provide an overview of key modeling techniques from physics-based and discrete-event simulation to hybrid approaches. Subsequently, we investigate the bidirectional role of AI: first, how AI enhances DTs through advanced analytics, predictive capabilities, and autonomous decision-making, and second, how DTs serve as valuable platforms for training, validating, and deploying AI models. The chapter concludes by identifying key challenges and future research directions for creating more integrated and intelligent systems.

*Amirhossein Farzam,Majid Behabahani,Mani Malek,Yuriy Nevmyvaka,Guillermo Sapiro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 针对大语言模型越狱攻击中攻击者通过操纵请求框架隐藏恶意目标的问题，本文提出自监督框架ReDAct来解耦LLM激活中的语义因子（目标与框架），并基于此构建FrameShield异常检测器，实现跨模型的安全防护和机理可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖结构特征或目标特定签名，难以检测流畅且语义连贯的越狱提示，特别是当攻击者通过灵活呈现方式操纵框架以隐藏恶意意图时。为此需要一种能够从LLM激活中分离语义因子的自监督方法。

Method: 提出自监督框架在推理时解耦LLM激活中的语义因子对，具体实例化目标与框架因子；构建GoalFrameBench提示语料库控制变量；训练ReDAct模块从冻结LLM中提取解耦表征；提出基于框架表征的FrameShield异常检测器。

Result: ReDAct提供理论保证，实证验证显示FrameShield能以极小计算开销提升跨多LLM家族的模型无关检测能力；解耦表征作为可解释性探针揭示了目标与框架信号的独立特征模式。

Conclusion: 语义解耦技术成为LLM安全防护和机理可解释性的重要基础模块，为构建更可靠的语言模型防御体系提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that are fluent and semantically coherent, and therefore difficult to detect with standard heuristics. A particularly challenging failure mode occurs when an attacker tries to hide the malicious goal of their request by manipulating its framing to induce compliance. Because these attacks maintain malicious intent through a flexible presentation, defenses that rely on structural artifacts or goal-specific signatures can fail. Motivated by this, we introduce a self-supervised framework for disentangling semantic factor pairs in LLM activations at inference. We instantiate the framework for goal and framing and construct GoalFrameBench, a corpus of prompts with controlled goal and framing variations, which we use to train Representation Disentanglement on Activations (ReDAct) module to extract disentangled representations in a frozen LLM. We then propose FrameShield, an anomaly detector operating on the framing representations, which improves model-agnostic detection across multiple LLM families with minimal computational overhead. Theoretical guarantees for ReDAct and extensive empirical validations show that its disentanglement effectively powers FrameShield. Finally, we use disentanglement as an interpretability probe, revealing distinct profiles for goal and framing signals and positioning semantic disentanglement as a building block for both LLM safety and mechanistic interpretability.

### [211] [OptiRepair: Closed-Loop Diagnosis and Repair of Supply Chain Optimization Models with LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19439)
*Ruicheng Ao,David Simchi-Levi,Xinshang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出 OptiRepair 方法，通过结合通用可行性修复和供应链领域特定的合理性验证，显著提升 AI 模型修复供应链优化模型不可行问题的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链优化模型常因建模错误变得不可行，诊断和修复需稀缺的专业知识。现有 AI 模型在此任务上的表现尚未得到充分测试，存在求解器交互和运营理论合理性两大差距。

Method: OptiRepair 将任务分为两个阶段：1) 领域无关的可行性阶段（迭代 IIS 引导的 LP 修复）；2) 领域特定的验证阶段（基于库存理论的五个合理性检查）。研究使用自我教学推理和求解器验证奖励训练了两个 8B 参数模型。

Result: 在 976 个多级供应链问题测试中，训练模型达到 81.7% 的理性恢复率（RRR），远优于最佳 API 模型的 42.2%。在 Phase 1 修复上，训练模型以 97.2% 的恢复率远超 API 模型的 27.6%。

Conclusion: AI 要实现可靠的模型修复，需分别解决求解器交互（可通过针对性训练改善）和运营理论合理性（需明确指定为可验证的检查）两大挑战。对运营规划采用 AI 的组织而言，形式化定义“理性”是其更高回报的投资。

Abstract: Problem Definition. Supply chain optimization models frequently become infeasible because of modeling errors. Diagnosis and repair require scarce OR expertise: analysts must interpret solver diagnostics, trace root causes across echelons, and fix formulations without sacrificing operational soundness. Whether AI agents can perform this task remains untested.
  Methodology/Results. OptiRepair splits this task into a domain-agnostic feasibility phase (iterative IIS-guided repair of any LP) and a domain-specific validation phase (five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory). We test 22 API models from 7 families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models using self-taught reasoning with solver-verified rewards. The trained models reach 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate (RRR) -- the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality -- versus 42.2% for the best API model and 21.3% on average. The gap concentrates in Phase 1 repair: API models average 27.6% recovery rate versus 97.2% for trained models.
  Managerial Implications. Two gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction (API models restore only 27.6% of infeasible formulations) and operational rationale (roughly one in four feasible repairs violate supply chain theory). Each requires a different intervention: solver interaction responds to targeted training; operational rationale requires explicit specification as solver-verifiable checks. For organizations adopting AI in operational planning, formalizing what "rational" means in their context is the higher-return investment.

Motivation: 多智能体决策流程在互补性成立时可超越单智能体工作流，不同智能体能提供独特信息以优化最终决策

Method: 基于决策理论设计ComplLLM后训练框架，使用互补信息作为奖励信号微调决策辅助型LLM，使其生成补充现有智能体决策的输出

Result: 在合成任务和真实世界领域专家任务中验证有效，能恢复已知的互补信息并为互补信号生成合理解释，辅助下游决策者

Conclusion: 该方法通过LLM微调有效利用多智能体系统中的互补信息，为实际决策场景提供可解释的互补信号支持

Abstract: Multi-agent decision pipelines can outperform single agent workflows when complementarity holds, i.e., different agents bring unique information to the table to inform a final decision. We propose ComplLLM, a post-training framework based on decision theory that fine-tunes a decision-assistant LLM using complementary information as reward to output signals that complement existing agent decisions. We validate ComplLLM on synthetic and real-world tasks involving domain experts, demonstrating how the approach recovers known complementary information and produces plausible explanations of complementary signals to support downstream decision-makers.

*Lalitha Pranathi Pulavarthy,Raajitha Muthyala,Aravind V Kuruvikkattil,Zhenan Yin,Rashmita Kudamala,Saptarshi Purkayastha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how human guidance improves agentic AI performance on multimodal clinical prediction tasks. By having human analysts direct feature engineering, model selection, and validation across three healthcare benchmarks (hospital readmission, ED cost forecasting, discharge readiness), the approach achieved 5th overall ranking with significant gains (+0.065 F1) over automated baselines, demonstrating that domain expertise at key decision points is crucial for clinical AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical prediction tasks require domain expertise that purely automated agentic AI systems struggle to provide, yet there's increasing capability for autonomous data science workflows. The paper investigates how human guidance can bridge this gap for multimodal clinical prediction tasks.

Method: Human analysts guided an agentic AI workflow at key decision points including multimodal feature engineering (clinical notes, PDF receipts, time-series vital signs), task-appropriate model selection, and clinically informed validation strategies across three healthcare benchmark challenges.

Result: Achieved 5th overall ranking in the AgentDS Healthcare benchmark (3rd place in discharge readiness). The human-guided approach yielded +0.065 F1 improvement over automated baselines, with multimodal feature extraction providing the largest single gain (+0.041 F1). Specific results: 30-day readmission (Macro-F1=0.8986), ED cost forecasting (MAE=$465.13), discharge readiness (Macro-F1=0.7939).

Conclusion: Three generalizable lessons: (1) domain-informed feature engineering yields compounding gains over automated search; (2) multimodal integration requires task-specific human judgment; (3) clinically motivated ensemble diversity outperforms random hyperparameter search. These provide practical guidance for healthcare AI deployment where interpretability and clinical validity are essential.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems are increasingly capable of autonomous data science workflows, yet clinical prediction tasks demand domain expertise that purely automated approaches struggle to provide. We investigate how human guidance of agentic AI can improve multimodal clinical prediction, presenting our approach to all three AgentDS Healthcare benchmark challenges: 30-day hospital readmission prediction (Macro-F1 = 0.8986), emergency department cost forecasting (MAE = $465.13), and discharge readiness assessment (Macro-F1 = 0.7939). Across these tasks, human analysts directed the agentic workflow at key decision points, multimodal feature engineering from clinical notes, scanned PDF billing receipts, and time-series vital signs; task-appropriate model selection; and clinically informed validation strategies. Our approach ranked 5th overall in the healthcare domain, with a 3rd-place finish on the discharge readiness task. Ablation studies reveal that human-guided decisions compounded to a cumulative gain of +0.065 F1 over automated baselines, with multimodal feature extraction contributing the largest single improvement (+0.041 F1). We distill three generalizable lessons: (1) domain-informed feature engineering at each pipeline stage yields compounding gains that outperform extensive automated search; (2) multimodal data integration requires task-specific human judgment that no single extraction strategy generalizes across clinical text, PDFs, and time-series; and (3) deliberate ensemble diversity with clinically motivated model configurations outperforms random hyperparameter search. These findings offer practical guidance for teams deploying agentic AI in healthcare settings where interpretability, reproducibility, and clinical validity are essential.

*Chongyang Gao,Diji Yang,Shuyan Zhou,Xichen Yan,Luchuan Song,Shuo Li,Kezhen Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CFE, a multimodal benchmark of real university STEM exams to evaluate LLM reasoning, finding that even top models like Gemini only achieve ~60% accuracy and struggle with multi-step state management while being less efficient than human solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities on authentic, challenging STEM problems from university coursework that require multi-step logical derivation.

Method: Curated a benchmark from repeatedly used university homework and exam problems with instructor-provided solutions, then performed diagnostic analysis by decomposing solutions into reasoning flows.

Result: Gemini-3.1-pro-preview achieves 59.69% accuracy (best), but models struggle to maintain correct intermediate states in multi-step solutions and generate more steps than instructors, indicating inefficiency and error accumulation risk.

Conclusion: CFE reveals significant gaps in frontier LLMs' reasoning capabilities, particularly in state maintenance across multi-step problems and step efficiency, leaving considerable room for improvement.

Abstract: We introduce \CFE{} (\textbf{C}lassroom \textbf{F}inal \textbf{E}xam), a multimodal benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models across more than 20 STEM domains. \CFE{} is curated from repeatedly used, authentic university homework and exam problems, together with reference solutions provided by course instructors. \CFE{} presents a significant challenge even for frontier models: the newly released Gemini-3.1-pro-preview achieves an overall accuracy of 59.69\%, while the second-best model, Gemini-3-flash-preview, reaches 55.46\%, leaving considerable room for improvement. Beyond leaderboard results, we perform a diagnostic analysis by decomposing reference solutions into reasoning flows. We find that although frontier models can often answer intermediate sub-questions correctly, they struggle to reliably derive and maintain correct intermediate states throughout multi-step solutions. We further observe that model-generated solutions typically have more reasoning steps than those provided by the instructor, indicating suboptimal step efficiency and a higher risk of error accumulation.

TL;DR: 自适应拒绝采样（Ada-RS）是一种样本过滤框架，通过选择性思考减少高达80%的token使用，同时保持工具调用准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在成本和延迟敏感的部署场景中，思维链推理会浪费简单请求的token，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出自适应拒绝采样（Ada-RS），一种与算法无关的样本过滤框架。对每个上下文生成多个补全样本，使用自适应长度惩罚奖励进行评分，然后通过随机拒绝采样保留高奖励候选或偏好对，可集成到DPO和DAPO等优化策略中。

Result: 在基于LoRA的Qwen3-8B模型上，使用合成电商工具调用基准测试，Ada-RS将平均输出token减少高达80%，思考率降低高达95%，同时维持或提升工具调用准确率。

Conclusion: 通过选择性思考进行训练信号选择是提升延迟敏感部署中推理效率的有效手段。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in cost and latency-sensitive settings. While chain-of-thought improves reasoning, it can waste tokens on simple requests. We study selective thinking for tool-using LLMs and introduce Adaptive Rejection Sampling (Ada-RS), an algorithm-agnostic sample filtering framework for learning selective and efficient reasoning. For each given context, Ada-RS scores multiple sampled completions with an adaptive length-penalized reward then applies stochastic rejection sampling to retain only high-reward candidates (or preference pairs) for downstream optimization. We demonstrate how Ada-RS plugs into both preference pair (e.g. DPO) or grouped policy optimization strategies (e.g. DAPO). Using Qwen3-8B with LoRA on a synthetic tool call-oriented e-commerce benchmark, Ada-RS improves the accuracy-efficiency frontier over standard algorithms by reducing average output tokens by up to 80% and reducing thinking rate by up to 95% while maintaining or improving tool call accuracy. These results highlight that training-signal selection is a powerful lever for efficient reasoning in latency-sensitive deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够在嘈杂、模糊的感知语境中为语言指称建立语义接地，但支持这种跨模态对齐的内在机制尚不明确。这是认知科学和人工智能领域的基础性问题。

Method: 提出计算框架，将语言表达与来自大规模众包图像的感知表示相结合。采用尺度不变特征变换（SIFT）对齐与通用质量指数（UQI）在认知合理的特征空间中量化相似性；通过语言预处理和查询转换操作捕捉指称表达的语用变异性。使用斯坦福重复指称游戏语料库（15,000条话语与七巧板刺激配对）进行评估。

Result: 实现稳健的指称接地：1）比人类对话者少用65%的话语即可达到稳定映射；2）从单次指称表达中正确识别目标对象的准确率为41.66%（人类为20%）；3）在经典认知基准上表现出人类竞争水平。

Conclusion: 相对简单的感知-语言对齐机制能够在经典认知基准测试中产生人类竞争性的行为，为接地通信、感知推理和跨模态概念形成的模型提供了新见解，代码已开源。

Abstract: Establishing stable mappings between natural language expressions and visual percepts is a foundational problem for both cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Humans routinely ground linguistic reference in noisy, ambiguous perceptual contexts, yet the mechanisms supporting such cross-modal alignment remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a computational framework designed to model core aspects of human referential interpretation by integrating linguistic utterances with perceptual representations derived from large-scale, crowd-sourced imagery. The system approximates human perceptual categorization by combining scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) alignment with the Universal Quality Index (UQI) to quantify similarity in a cognitively plausible feature space, while a set of linguistic preprocessing and query-transformation operations captures pragmatic variability in referring expressions. We evaluate the model on the Stanford Repeated Reference Game corpus (15,000 utterances paired with tangram stimuli), a paradigm explicitly developed to probe human-level perceptual ambiguity and coordination. Our framework achieves robust referential grounding. It requires 65\% fewer utterances than human interlocutors to reach stable mappings and can correctly identify target objects from single referring expressions 41.66\% of the time (versus 20\% for humans).These results suggest that relatively simple perceptual-linguistic alignment mechanisms can yield human-competitive behavior on a classic cognitive benchmark, and offers insights into models of grounded communication, perceptual inference, and cross-modal concept formation.

TL;DR: A review of AI-to-AI interaction ecosystem failures leads to ClawdLab, an open-source platform enabling secure, decentralized autonomous scientific research through novel governance and protocol constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale autonomous AI-to-AI interaction datasets revealed severe security vulnerabilities and architectural failures, while existing platforms couldn't support fully decentralized multi-agent collaboration for scientific research.

Method: Multivocal literature review of six publications on OpenClaw/Moltbook ecosystem, analyzing emergent phenomena, security issues, and architectural patterns, then design science approach to build ClawdLab.

Result: Found 131 vulnerable agent skills, 15,200+ exposed control panels, and five architectural patterns. ClawdLab implements role restrictions, adversarial critique, PI governance, multi-model orchestration, and protocol-based evidence requirements that provide emergent Sybil resistance. A three-tier taxonomy shows most platforms are limited to non-decentralized approaches.

Conclusion: ClawdLab's composable third-tier architecture enables secure, fully decentralized autonomous scientific research that compounds improvements with AI ecosystem advancement, overcoming limitations of current co-scientist platforms.

Abstract: In January 2026, the open-source agent framework OpenClaw and the agent-only social network Moltbook produced a large-scale dataset of autonomous AI-to-AI interaction, attracting six academic publications within fourteen days. This study conducts a multivocal literature review of that ecosystem and presents ClawdLab, an open-source platform for autonomous scientific research, as a design science response to the architectural failure modes identified. The literature documents emergent collective phenomena, security vulnerabilities spanning 131 agent skills and over 15,200 exposed control panels, and five recurring architectural patterns. ClawdLab addresses these failure modes through hard role restrictions, structured adversarial critique, PI-led governance, multi-model orchestration, and domain-specific evidence requirements encoded as protocol constraints that ground validation in computational tool outputs rather than social consensus; the architecture provides emergent Sybil resistance as a structural consequence. A three-tier taxonomy distinguishes single-agent pipelines, predetermined multi-agent workflows, and fully decentralised systems, analysing why leading AI co-scientist platforms remain confined to the first two tiers. ClawdLab's composable third-tier architecture, in which foundation models, capabilities, governance, and evidence requirements are independently modifiable, enables compounding improvement as the broader AI ecosystem advances.

Meta-learning overcomes this limitation by allowing models to acquire transferable knowledge from various tasks, enabling rapid adaptation to new challenges with minimal data. This survey provides a rigorous, task-based formalization of meta-learning and meta-reinforcement learning and uses that paradigm to chronicle the landmark algorithms that paved the way for DeepMind's Adaptive Agent, consolidating the essential concepts needed to understand the Adaptive Agent and other generalist approaches.

Motivation: 现有AI推理基准难以反映真实人类推理过程，缺乏自然情境下的评估能力

Result: 2025年前9个月，AI性能从人类比较组下四分位提升至前5%；50%进步来自持续优化，50%源于推理架构突破；模型在长案例（1900-4000字）中表现下降，但早期证据不足时归纳推理占优

Conclusion: 该基准有效量化AI推理进展，揭示模型性能显著提升且与自然人类推理差异缩小，但长文本处理仍是挑战

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for AI reasoning provide limited insight into how closely these capabilities resemble human reasoning in naturalistic contexts. We present an adaptation of the Watson & Holmes detective tabletop game as a new benchmark designed to evaluate reasoning performance using incrementally presented narrative evidence, open-ended questions and unconstrained language responses. An automated grading system was developed and validated against human assessors to enable scalable and replicable performance evaluation. Results show a clear improvement in AI model performance over time. Over nine months of 2025, model performance rose from the lower quartile of the human comparison group to approximately the top 5%. Around half of this improvement reflects steady advancement across successive model releases, while the remainder corresponds to a marked step change associated with reasoning-oriented model architectures. Systematic differences in the performance of AI models compared to humans, dependent on features of the specific detection puzzle, were mostly absent with the exception of a fall in performance for models when solving longer cases (case lengths being in the range of 1900-4000 words), and an advantage at inductive reasoning for reasoning models at early stages of case solving when evidence was scant.

TL;DR: 代码智能体因导航与检索本质差异而失败，而非上下文限制。基于图的CodeCompass导航实现99.4%成功率，但存在58%工具调用缺失的采纳鸿沟，需显式提示工程实现行为对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在超过100万token上下文中，代码智能体仍无法发现架构关键文件，揭示"导航悖论"——导航与检索是本质不同的问题。

Method: 在FastAPI生产仓库上开展258次自动化试验，覆盖30个基准任务，对比CodeCompass（基于Model Context Protocol的依赖图导航）与基础智能体及BM25检索方法。

Result: CodeCompass实现99.4%任务完成率，相比基础智能体(76.2%)和BM25检索(78.2%)分别提升23.2和21.2个百分点。但58%的实验未调用图工具，暴露显著采纳鸿沟。

Conclusion: 瓶颈在于行为对齐而非工具可用性，需显式引导智能体优先使用结构上下文而非词法启发式。贡献包括任务分类法、图导航有效性的实证证据，以及开源评估基础设施。

Abstract: Modern code intelligence agents operate in contexts exceeding 1 million tokens--far beyond the scale where humans manually locate relevant files. Yet agents consistently fail to discover architecturally critical files when solving real-world coding tasks. We identify the Navigation Paradox: agents perform poorly not due to context limits, but because navigation and retrieval are fundamentally distinct problems. Through 258 automated trials across 30 benchmark tasks on a production FastAPI repository, we demonstrate that graph-based structural navigation via CodeCompass--a Model Context Protocol server exposing dependency graphs--achieves 99.4% task completion on hidden-dependency tasks, a 23.2 percentage-point improvement over vanilla agents (76.2%) and 21.2 points over BM25 retrieval (78.2%).However, we uncover a critical adoption gap: 58% of trials with graph access made zero tool calls, and agents required explicit prompt engineering to adopt the tool consistently. Our findings reveal that the bottleneck is not tool availability but behavioral alignment--agents must be explicitly guided to leverage structural context over lexical heuristics. We contribute: (1) a task taxonomy distinguishing semantic-search, structural, and hidden-dependency scenarios; (2) empirical evidence that graph navigation outperforms retrieval when dependencies lack lexical overlap; and (3) open-source infrastructure for reproducible evaluation of navigation tools.

*Yuzhe Wang,Yaochen Zhu,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了CausalFlip基准测试，用于评估大语言模型的因果推理能力，研究表明内部化推理过程相比基于语义关联的方法能显著提升因果推理的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险决策场景中需要真正的因果推理而非虚假相关性，但传统基准测试无法区分模型是掌握因果结构还是仅记忆语义模式。

Method: 构建CausalFlip基准，包含基于事件三元组的因果判断问题对（混杂因子、链式、对撞关系），设计语义相似但答案相反的问题对以测试模型依赖性，引入噪声前缀评估，并对比三种训练范式：仅答案、显式思维链监督、内部化因果推理。

Result: 显式思维链仍易被语义关联误导，而内部化推理步骤显著提升因果基础，表明基础大模型具有未被充分激发的潜在因果推理能力。

Conclusion: 内部化因果推理方法有希望推动大模型在高风险场景中基于真实因果关系而非虚假语义关联进行决策。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) witness increasing deployment in complex, high-stakes decision-making scenarios, it becomes imperative to ground their reasoning in causality rather than spurious correlations. However, strong performance on traditional reasoning benchmarks does not guarantee true causal reasoning ability of LLMs, as high accuracy may still arise from memorizing semantic patterns instead of analyzing the underlying true causal structures. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a new causal reasoning benchmark, CausalFlip, designed to encourage the development of new LLM paradigm or training algorithms that ground LLM reasoning in causality rather than semantic correlation. CausalFlip consists of causal judgment questions built over event triples that could form different confounder, chain, and collider relations. Based on this, for each event triple, we construct pairs of semantically similar questions that reuse the same events but yield opposite causal answers, where models that rely heavily on semantic matching are systematically driven toward incorrect predictions. To further probe models' reliance on semantic patterns, we introduce a noisy-prefix evaluation that prepends causally irrelevant text before intermediate causal reasoning steps without altering the underlying causal relations or the logic of the reasoning process. We evaluate LLMs under multiple training paradigms, including answer-only training, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, and a proposed internalized causal reasoning approach that aims to mitigate explicit reliance on correlation in the reasoning process. Our results show that explicit CoT can still be misled by spurious semantic correlations, where internalizing reasoning steps yields substantially improved causal grounding, suggesting that it is promising to better elicit the latent causal reasoning capabilities of base LLMs.

Abstract: In human-AI decision making, designing AI that complements human expertise has been a natural strategy to enhance human-AI collaboration, yet it often comes at the cost of decreased AI performance in areas of human strengths. This can inadvertently erode human trust and cause them to ignore AI advice precisely when it is most needed. Conversely, an aligned AI fosters trust yet risks reinforcing suboptimal human behavior and lowering human-AI team performance. In this paper, we start by identifying this fundamental tension between performance-boosting (i.e., complementarity) and trust-building (i.e., alignment) as an inherent limitation of the traditional approach for training a single AI model to assist human decision making. To overcome this, we introduce a novel human-centered adaptive AI ensemble that strategically toggles between two specialist AI models - the aligned model and the complementary model - based on contextual cues, using an elegantly simple yet provably near-optimal Rational Routing Shortcut mechanism. Comprehensive theoretical analyses elucidate why the adaptive AI ensemble is effective and when it yields maximum benefits. Moreover, experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that when humans are assisted by the adaptive AI ensemble in decision making, they can achieve significantly higher performance than when they are assisted by single AI models that are trained to either optimize for their independent performance or even the human-AI team performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for training reasoning language models (RLMs) by leveraging supervision from verifiers. Although verifier implementation is easier than solution annotation for many tasks, existing synthetic data generation methods remain largely solution-centric, while verifier-based methods rely on a few hand-crafted procedural environments. In this work, we scale RLVR by introducing ReSyn, a pipeline that generates diverse reasoning environments equipped with instance generators and verifiers, covering tasks such as constraint satisfaction, algorithmic puzzles, and spatial reasoning. A Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model trained with RL on ReSyn data achieves consistent gains across reasoning benchmarks and out-of-domain math benchmarks, including a 27\% relative improvement on the challenging BBEH benchmark. Ablations show that verifier-based supervision and increased task diversity both contribute significantly, providing empirical evidence that generating reasoning environments at scale can enhance reasoning abilities in RLMs

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 该研究发现，除CsV2Te2O外，大多数AV2Q2O族化合物因层间反铁磁耦合而非铁磁耦合，无法形成体相变磁态，且空穴掺杂无法改变其磁基态


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期研究假设层间铁磁耦合是维持体相变磁态的关键，但实际层间耦合性质尚未系统验证，需通过全家族磁性序与层间耦合分析确认其变磁性

Method: 对AV2Q2O家族（A=K/Rb/Cs；Q=S/Se/Te）进行系统性磁性序与层间耦合分析，并通过空穴掺杂模拟碱金属空位缺陷

Result: 单层逆李布晶格内禀支持变磁序，但弱层间耦合导致大多数化合物形成克喇末简并的反铁磁序（磁胞加倍），仅CsV2Te2O保持变磁性；空穴掺杂不改变磁基态

Conclusion: 化学计量比的块体AV2Q2O材料中仅CsV2Te2O为变磁体，实际非化学计量缺陷无法诱导变磁态，修正了此前KV2Se2O等候选材料的误判

Abstract: Vanadium-based oxychalcogenide compounds with the inverse Lieb-lattice (ILL) structural pattern have recently been proposed as candidate altermagnets (AM). However, early studies postulated ferromagnetic interlayer coupling, a critical requirement for preserving the bulk AM state. Here we present a systematic survey of the complete AV2Q2O family (A = K, Rb, Cs; Q = S, Se, Te) in terms of their magnetic ordering and interlayer coupling. While intralayer exchange interaction favors AM ordering in a single ILL layer across the entire family, the relatively weak interlayer coupling in most cases favors Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic order with a doubled magnetic unit cell. This means that most stoichiometric bulk materials, including the previously proposed candidate KV2Se2O, are not altermagnetic, with CsV2Te2O being the only exception. Using hole doping to simulate alkali vacancies, we show that realistic deviations from stoichiometry do not change the magnetic ground state in these compounds.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This study uses DFT and Boltzmann transport theory to demonstrate that chemical precompression can induce metal-insulator transitions and magnetic variations in kagome materials Nb3XCl7 by introducing a breathing effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kagome materials have unique electronic properties but few compounds show tunable electrical conductivity, which limits their device applications.

Method: The breathing effect was introduced into Nb3XCl7 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) via chemical precompression, using density functional theory (DFT) and Boltzmann transport theory to calculate band structures, conductivity and magnetic properties.

Result: Monolayer Nb3Cl8 and Nb3XCl7 undergo transitions from paramagnetic metals to Mott insulators at U_eff=1 eV and t_out/t_in=0.6674. Stronger breathing effect enhances chemical precompression, facilitating the metal-insulator transition.

Conclusion: The study establishes a practical framework for investigating breathing effects in correlated kagome systems and provides predictive synthesis guidance for experimental studies.

Abstract: Kagome materials featuring dispersive Dirac cones and topological flat bands exhibit unique electronic and magnetic properties. However, kagome compounds with tunable electrical conductivity remain scarce, which severely impedes their device applications. Here, based on density functional theory (DFT) and Boltzmann transport theory, we introduce the breathing effect into kagome materials $\mathrm{Nb_3XCl_7}$ (X = F, Cl, Br, I) via chemical precompression, thereby inducing a metal-insulator transition and magnetic variation. We determine that the band structures, optical absorption spectra and magnetic ground states agree well with experimental results at the effective correlation strength $U_{\text{eff}} = 2$ eV. The calculated conductivity and magnetic properties reveal that the monolayer $\mathrm{Nb_3Cl_8}$ and $\mathrm{Nb_3XCl_7}$ undergoes transitions from paramagnetic metals to Mott insulators at $U_{\text{eff}} = 1$ eV and $t_{\text{out}}/t_{\text{in}} = 0.6674$, respectively. Our detailed analysis establishes that the stronger breathing effect corresponds to enhanced chemical precompression, which reduces the region of free electron gas between intercell Nb atoms and facilitates the metal-insulator transition. Finally, we propose several viable synthesis routes for $\mathrm{Nb_3FCl_7}$, $\mathrm{Nb_3BrCl_7}$, and $\mathrm{Nb_3ICl_7}$, providing predictive guidance for experimental studies. Our study establishes a practical framework for investigating the breathing effect in correlated kagome systems and yields valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying metal-insulator transition and magnetic properties in real breathing kagome materials.

TL;DR: Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Ge$_5$展现出罕见的硬面反铁磁序，磁矩位于ab面内，尽管顺磁区易轴沿c方向。这种反转源于4f电子部分离域增强的面内RKKY交换，与近藤屏蔽和单离子各向异性竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬面反铁磁序在Ce基近藤晶格中极为罕见，其形成机制尚不清楚。研究这类材料对理解局域磁矩与传导电子相互作用，以及单离子各向异性、近藤屏蔽和RKKY交换之间的竞争关系具有重要意义。

Method: 采用中子衍射确定磁矩取向，利用非弹性中子散射和磁化率测量确定顺磁区的磁易轴方向，并建立统一的微观理论框架。

Result: 实验发现Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Ge$_5$的磁矩位于ab平面，而顺磁区的易轴沿c方向。4f电子的部分离域增强了面内RKKY交换作用，从而克服了单离子各向异性的影响。

Conclusion: Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Ge$_5$提供了一个关键实验体系，其中单离子各向异性、近藤屏蔽和RKKY交换在可比能量尺度上竞争，为理解强杂化近藤晶格中的硬轴磁序提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Hard plane antiferromagnetic order where ordered moments lie perpendicular to the single-ion crystal electric field easy axis is rare in Ce-based Kondo lattices and is a subject of active interest. Here we show that Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Ge$_5$ realizes a hard-plane antiferromagnetic state in which partial delocalization of the local moment gives rise to an RKKY exchange that overturns the single-ion easy-axis preference. Neutron diffraction reveals moments in the $ab$ plane, while inelastic neutron scattering and susceptibility establish a magnetic easy axis along $c$ in the paramagnetic regime, highlighting a clear inversion between single-ion and ordered-state anisotropies. In this work, we establish a unified microscopic framework to consistently account for partial $4f$-moment delocalization, enhanced in-plane RKKY exchange, and the resulting hard-plane antiferromagnetic order. Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Ge$_5$ thus provides a benchmark system in which single-ion anisotropy, Kondo screening, and RKKY exchange compete on comparable energy scales, revealing a cooperative route to hard-axis ordering in strongly hybridized Kondo lattices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mott绝缘体在强光激发下可能产生超越传统光伏效率极限的载流子倍增效应，但研究其非平衡动力学需模拟热力学极限（格点数量无限大），而传统数值方法因希尔伯特空间指数级膨胀，仅能处理约30×30的小系统

Method: 将原本用于求解偏微分方程的傅里叶神经算符（FNO）创新应用于量子多体系统：训练模型学习"噪声扰动基态动量分布→脉冲后动量分布"的映射关系，仅使用小尺寸晶格数据

Result: 零样本泛化能力：仅训练小系统（~30×30），即可准确预测1024×1024超大系统的动量分布（数秒内完成），结果符合关键物理量的理论预期，而传统数值模拟尚无法处理此尺度

Conclusion: 证明神经算符可直接获取强关联材料的大尺度非平衡动力学，为突破热力学极限模拟提供新范式，助力开发高效率光电器件材料

Abstract: Mott insulators exhibit complex photoexcitation dynamics under intense optical driving, with potential implications for carrier multiplication beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit. Probing these nonequilibrium processes requires access to the thermodynamic limit, where the number of lattice sites becomes arbitrarily large, but conventional solvers are constrained to small systems due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space. Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), originally developed for solving partial differential equations, naturally accommodate inputs of varying resolution and are capable of capturing nonlocal effects. Here, we employ FNOs to learn the mapping from noise-perturbed ground-state momentum distributions to their post-pulse counterparts across a range of interaction strengths and driving parameters. Trained only on small lattices, the model generalizes zero-shot to much larger systems, producing physically reasonable momentum distributions well beyond the reach of numerical solvers. Specifically, the model can predict momentum distribution for a 1024x1024 system within a few seconds that matches the theoretical behavior of key observables, whereas direct numerical simulations have so far been restricted to edge sizes of ~30. These results demonstrate the potential of neural operators to directly access large-scale nonequilibrium dynamics, providing a new pathway toward the thermodynamic limit in strongly correlated materials.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AV3Sb5 kagome metals/superconductors represent a nexus of multiple quantum states requiring systematic study to understand their fundamental electronic interactions and transport mechanisms.

Method: Systematic electric and thermal transport measurements on CsV3Sb5, including resistivity and thermal conductivity at zero/finite magnetic fields to separate electronic and lattice contributions.

Result: Multiple inelastic resistivity contributions observed; T² prefactor matches Kadowaki-Woods scaling for moderate correlations; Wiedemann-Franz law holds at zero temperature but shows downward deviation at finite temperature; Bloch-Grüneisen model successfully describes transport, revealing a large e-ph collision cross section.

Conclusion: CsV3Sb5 exhibits strong electron-phonon coupling and moderate electronic correlations, with transport properties well-characterized by Fermi liquid theory, providing crucial insight into the quantum states of kagome metals.

Abstract: AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs) are kagome metals and superconductors, attracting much recent attention as nexus of multiple quantum states. Here, through a systematic study of electric and thermal transport of CsV3Sb5, we identify iy as a metallic Fermi liquid with moderate electronic correlations ans strong electron-phonon (e-ph) collision cross section. We observe contributions to the inelastic electrical resistivity, each dominating within a distinct temperature window. The prefactor of the T2 is consistent with the Kadowaki-Woods scaling for a Fermi liquid with moderate correlation. By performing thermal conductivity measurements at zero and finite magnetic field, we separate the electronic and the lattice contributions to the thermal conductivity. The Wiedemann-Franz law is is satisfied in the zero-temperature limit, while a downward deviation emerges at finite temperature due to the mismatch between the prefactors of the electrical and thermal quadratic resistivities, as reported in other metals. The Bloch-Grüneisen description of electron-phonon scattering successfully accounts for both electronic thermal and electrical transport, indicating a remarkably large e-ph collision cross section in CsV3Sb5.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种基于机器学习的初始化方法，利用核岭回归模型直接从目标杂化函数预测近乎最优的浴参数，以克服HD-DMFT中非线性浴拟合的计算瓶颈。通过在物理相关的紧束缚模型数据集上训练，该方法能显著减少拟合误差、降低迭代次数并提高收敛稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在哈密顿量对角化动态平均场理论中，连续杂化函数需通过最小化非凸多变量代价函数离散化为有限浴参数。随着浴位点增加，优化过程对初始猜测极度敏感且易陷入局部极小值，导致DMFT自洽循环变慢甚至发散。

Method: 将浴拟合重构为监督回归问题，训练核岭回归模型从Matsubara轴杂化函数直接预测浴参数。构建包含层状钙钛矿型钌酸盐模型在系统形变下紧束缚哈密顿量的物理相关训练集，通过完全收敛的传统拟合获取高质量标签，并在特征与目标中显式引入时间反演对称性以降低维度并保证物理一致性。

Result: 非相互作用基准测试表明，该学习初始化方法系统性地降低初始拟合误差、减少共轭梯度迭代次数，并在宽泛浴尺寸范围内增强对局部极小值的鲁棒性。在Sr2RuO4相互作用DMFT计算中验证了可迁移性，相比对称性保持的启发式基线收敛更快且最终解质量不变。

Conclusion: 机器学习初始化策略有效解决了HD-DMFT浴拟合瓶颈，在不牺牲解质量的前提下显著提升计算效率与稳定性，并展现出向真实相互作用体系迁移的良好潜力。

Abstract: We propose a machine-learning-based initialization method to overcome the nonlinear bath-fitting bottleneck in Hamiltonian-diagonalization-based dynamical mean-field theory (HD-DMFT). In HD-DMFT, the continuous hybridization function is approximated by a finite set of bath-site energies and hybridization amplitudes, determined by minimizing a highly non-convex multivariable cost function. As the number of bath sites increases, the optimization becomes more sensitive to the initial guess and more prone to suboptimal local minima, which can slow or destabilize the DMFT self-consistency loop. We reformulate bath fitting as a supervised regression problem and train a kernel ridge regression model to predict near-optimal discrete bath parameters directly from the target hybridization function on the Matsubara axis. To ensure physical relevance and data diversity, we construct the training dataset from tight-binding Hamiltonians of layered-perovskite-like ruthenate models across systematically deformed structures, instead of relying on naive random parameter sampling, and obtain high-quality labels through fully converged conventional bath fitting. Time-reversal symmetry is explicitly incorporated in both feature and target representations to reduce effective dimensionality and enforce physical consistency. Benchmarks in the non-interacting limit show that the learned initialization systematically reduces the initial fitting error, decreases the number of conjugate-gradient iterations, and improves robustness against local minima over a wide range of bath sizes. We further demonstrate transferability to interacting DMFT calculations for $\mathrm{Sr_{2}RuO_{4}}$ solved with an adaptive-truncation impurity solver, where the ML initialization yields consistently faster convergence than a symmetry-preserving heuristic baseline while preserving the final fitted solution.

Abstract: The mechanisms by which isolated interacting quantum systems evade thermalization extend beyond disorder-induced many-body localization, encompassing a growing class of interaction-driven phenomena. We investigate a spin-1/2 ladder with asymmetric XY leg couplings and tunable Ising interactions on the rungs, and identify the microscopic origin of many-body localization (MBL) in this setting. Through a suite of diagnostics -including entanglement dynamics, fidelity susceptibility, adiabatic gauge potential norms, level-spacing statistics and entropy of eigenstates- we uncover a reentrant progression of dynamical regimes as the rung coupling Jz is varied: integrable behavior at Jz=0, quantum chaos at intermediate Jz, and a robust nonthermal regime at strong coupling. In the latter regime, we demonstrate the emergence of a reversed quantum disentangled liquid (reversed-QDL), where the light species thermalizes while the heavy species remains localized. The strong-coupling limit further yields emergent local integrals of motion anchored in a fixed-point structure, providing a microscopic origin of the observed quasi-MBL dynamics. These results establish reversed-QDL as a distinct, disorder-free route to nonergodicity and broaden the classification of dynamical phases in quantum matter.

Abstract: We study the robustness of the Floquet quantum Ising model against integrability-breaking perturbations, focusing on the phase hosting both Majorana zero and $π$ modes. A recent work [Phys. Rev. B 110, 075117, (2024)] observed that the Floquet product mode, a composite edge mode constructed from both Majorana operators, is considerably more robust than the individual Majorana edge modes. We analyze these strong modes from the point of view of the eigenphase order present in finite chains with open boundary conditions. As a result of the Majorana modes, all Floquet eigenstates come in quadruplets in the integrable limit. We show that the robustness of the various modes as well as the behavior of the boundary spin correlation functions can be understood in terms of the spectral statistics of these quadruplets in the presence of integrability-breaking perturbations.

Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical studies have suggested a possible Dirac magnon gap in the two-dimensional ferromagnetic semiconductor CrSiTe$_3$. Detailed neutron scattering measurements were performed to shed light on the existence of the magnon gap, and suggest that the gap is very small or non-existent, with previous measurements being complicated by experimental factors. During these measurements, it was found that the out-of-plane couplings could explain the usual property of the increase in the magnetic transition temperature when CrSiTe$_3$ is exfoliated to monolayers. Furthermore, the material was shown to have anisotropic magnons along the out-of-plane direction, through the proposed Dirac point. We speculate that this is due to an exchange anisotropy, though Kitaev-like interactions alone cannot explain the spectra.

Abstract: Controlling the properties and thus the functionalities of correlated electron systems via externally tunable perturbations has always remained a cherished goal in quantum condensed matter physics. Recently, straintronics has proved to be one such external control which can dictate the quantum phases and transitions in materials via the reconstruction of their electronic band structure. A particularly intriguing scenario arises in the context of flat band line-graph lattices wherein straintronics is found to bring forth non trivial phase transitions. This paper reports the phase transitions and thermal scales across the Lieb/Kagome interconversion in the electronic interaction-strain-temperature space. Based on the thermodynamic, spectroscopic and transport signatures across the strain tuned interconversion of these line-graph lattices we have mapped out the low temperature phases and thermal transition scales, numerically determined using non perturbative calculations. While at the low temperatures, interaction-strain plane is spanned by magnetically correlated insulators, flat band induced weak transiently localized insulators and non Fermi liquid metallic phases, thermal fluctuations aid in to stabilize coexistent magnetic correlations. Apart from quantifying the magnetic transition scales in this system our results on the spectroscopic and transport signatures distill the strain tuned metal-insulator transition and crossover scales which exhibit variable transport scaling exponents.

Abstract: We perform a renormalized mean-field study of the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model, focusing on the intricate interplay and possible coexistence of magnetic, charge, and superconducting orders. We improve on conventional mean-field theory by utilizing a renormalization group framework that captures high-energy fluctuations. This method generates effective magnetic and $d$-wave pairing interactions, and allows for an unbiased exploration of coexisting phases at weak and moderate interaction strengths. Unrestricted mean-field calculations of the effective Hamiltonian on large finite lattices are combined with analyses in the thermodynamic limit, revealing a rich phase diagram with extensive regions of coexisting orders. We find that $d$-wave superconductivity coexists with Néel order on the electron-doped side. On the hole-doped side, superconductivity is found to coexist with spiral or stripe magnetic orders. Within the stripe ordered region, the superconducting order parameter is spatially modulated, with a period that follows the charge modulation of the stripes. Below van Hove filling, pairing provides the primary energy gain, while the stripe order yields only a small, and hence fragile, additional energy lowering.

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: 本文研究带显式约束的控制流图的边覆盖问题，分析五种约束类型对测试集设计可行性和计算复杂性的影响，发现其中一种约束可在多项式时间解决，其余四种为NP完全，但针对负约束提出了固定参数可解算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在软件测试中，实现特定白盒覆盖率是经典问题，但现有方法未充分考虑顶点间的额外约束。本文旨在探究这些约束如何影响边覆盖测试集的可行性与计算复杂度，以满足实际测试需求如强制流程、语义排除或执行成本限制。

Method: 通过扩展标准边覆盖构造分析正约束的多项式时间解法；对负、单次、至多一次及总是约束，采用SAT问题的多项式归约证明其NP完全性；并针对负约束研究固定参数可处理性，以约束数量为参数设计FPT算法。

Result: 正约束的边覆盖测试集存在性可在多项式时间判定；其余四种约束的判定问题均为NP完全，即使在无环图中依然成立；负约束问题存在以约束数量为参数的FPT算法。

Conclusion: 显式约束显著影响边覆盖的计算复杂性，部分约束类型可通过高效算法处理，而NP难问题可通过参数化方法应对，为实际测试用例生成提供理论依据。

Abstract: The article studies edge coverage for control flow graphs extended with explicit constraints. Achieving a given level of white-box coverage for a given code is a classic problem in software testing. We focus on designing test sets that achieve edge coverage \textit{while respecting additional constraints} between vertices. The paper analyzes how such constraints affect both the feasibility and computational complexity of edge coverage.
  The paper discusses five types of constraints. POSITIVE constraints require at least one test path where a given vertex precedes another. NEGATIVE constraints forbid any such test path. ONCE constraints require exactly one test path with a single occurrence of one vertex before another. MAX ONCE constraints allow such precedence in at most one test path. ALWAYS constraints require every test path containing a given vertex to also contain another vertex later on the same path. Each type models a different test requirement, such as mandatory flows, semantic exclusions, or execution cost limits.
  We investigate the computational complexity of finding a test set that achieves edge coverage and respects a given set of constraints. For POSITIVE constraints, the existence of an edge covering test set is decidable in polynomial time by extending standard edge coverage constructions with additional paths for each constraint. For NEGATIVE, MAX ONCE, ONCE, and ALWAYS constraints, the decision problem is NP-complete. The proofs rely on polynomial reductions from variants of SAT. The NP-completeness results hold even for restricted graph classes, including acyclic graphs, for all these four constraints.
  Finally, we study the fixed-parameter tractability of the NEGATIVE constraint. Although the general problem is NP-complete, the paper presents an FPT algorithm with respect to the number of constraints.

Abstract: The sandpile automata of Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld (Phys. Rev. Lett., 1987) are a simple model for the diffusion of particles in space. A fundamental problem related to the complexity of the model is predicting its evolution in the parallel setting. Despite decades of effort, a classification of this problem for two-dimensional sandpile automata remains outstanding. Fungal automata were recently proposed by Goles et al. (Phys. Lett. A, 2020) as a spin-off of the model in which diffusion occurs either in horizontal $(H)$ or vertical $(V)$ directions according to a so-called update scheme. Goles et al. proved that the prediction problem for this model with the update scheme $H^4V^4$ is $\textbf{P}$-complete. This result was subsequently improved by Modanese and Worsch (Algorithmica, 2024), who showed the problem is $\textbf{P}$-complete also for the simpler updatenscheme $HV$. In this work, we fill in the gaps and prove that the prediction problem is $\textbf{P}$-complete for any update scheme that contains both $H$ and $V$ at least once.

Abstract: Student-Teacher Games are a model of computation in which a computationally restricted Student attempts to produce a string satisfying a refutable property, while an all-powerful Teacher refutes incorrect candidates by providing counterexamples. By the classical result of Krajíček, Pudlák, and Takeuti [KPT90], such games capture the witnessing of $\forall\exists\forall$-formulas in bounded arithmetic. In this paper, we introduce subclasses of total search problems in the polynomial hierarchy, classified by the number of rounds and candidate answers per round required for a Student at the corresponding level to solve them. Assuming the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse, we separate these classes for different number of rounds and queries. As applications we obtain the following results:
  (a) We study theories of bounded arithmetic axiomatized by fine-grained variants of length induction and bounded collection. We prove a general witnessing theorem connecting their $\forall\exists\forall$-consequences to the appropriate classes of Student-Teacher Games. Under the non-collapse of the polynomial hierarchy, we separate these theories.
  (b) These conditional separations resolve two open problems in bounded arithmetic: one by Buss and Ressayre [Bus85, CK93] on the strength of bounded collection, and one by Pollett [Pol97] on the difference between strict and non-strict double length induction.
  (c) Finally, we extend the unprovability of circuit upper bounds due to Krajíček and Oliveira [KO17] to the theory $PV_1+BB(Σ^b_1)$, and the unprovability of strong co-nondeterministic circuit lower bounds due to Pich and Santhanam [PS21] to the theory $PV_1+LLIND(sΣ^b_1)$. By the preceding separations, both theories strictly extend $PV_1$ assuming $NP\nsubseteq P/poly$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy system time series (solar irradiance, wind speed, electrical load) exhibit strong diurnal/seasonal periodicities with time-varying statistical properties that stationary or classical persistence models cannot accurately capture.

Method: Introduces a family of analytical forecasting operators for cyclostationary processes using closed-form coefficient λ̃(t,τ)=½(1+ρ(t,τ)), where ρ(t,τ) measures local correlation between current observation and its phase-aligned counterpart, embedding temporal symmetry.

Result: Validation on synthetic cyclostationary signals and empirical renewable energy datasets demonstrates consistent accuracy gains over classical persistence, particularly for multi-hour forecasting horizons.

Conclusion: The framework provides a physically interpretable, reproducible, and computationally minimal baseline for forecasting periodic processes across energy and complex systems by leveraging temporal symmetry.

Abstract: Time series in energy systems, such as solar irradiance, wind speed, or electrical load, are characterized by strong diurnal and seasonal periodicities. Accurate forecasting requires accounting for time varying statistical properties that stationary or classical persistence models cannot capture. \cyr{A family of analytical forecasting operators for cyclostationary processes is introduced, extending persistence through a closed form coefficient $\tildeλ(t,τ)=\tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(1+ρ(t,τ)\bigr)$, where $ρ(t,τ)$ denotes the local correlation between the current observation and its phase aligned counterpart}. This formulation preserves periodic variance and covariance, achieving a symmetry induced reduction of effective degrees of freedom. The resulting operator defines a training free analytical limit of persistence under periodic non stationarity. Validation on synthetic cyclostationary signals and empirical renewable energy datasets demonstrates consistent accuracy gains over classical persistence, particularly at multi hour horizons. By embedding temporal symmetry into the prediction process, the framework provides a physically interpretable, reproducible, and computationally minimal baseline for forecasting periodic processes across energy and complex systems.

Motivation: 量子退火性能受量子相变处的最小能隙Δ限制，理解Δ随系统尺寸N的缩放规律对评估量子退火机解决组合优化问题的潜力至关重要

Conclusion: 超代数缩放是二维自旋玻璃的普适特征，而SK模型的较好缩放行为为稠密连接优化问题在量子退火机上的高效求解提供了乐观前景

Abstract: The performance of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization is fundamentally limited by the minimum energy gap $Δ$ encountered at quantum phase transitions. We investigate the scaling of $Δ$ with system size $N$ for two paradigmatic quantum spin-glass models: the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson (2D-EA) and the all-to-all Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models. Utilizing a newly proposed unbiased energy-gap estimator for continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by high-performance sparse eigenvalue solvers, we characterize the gap distributions across disorder realizations. It is found that, in the 2D-EA case, the inverse-gap distribution develops a fat tail with infinite variance as $N$ increases. This indicates that the unfavorable super-algebraic scaling of $Δ$, recently reported for binary couplings [Nature 631, 749 (2024)], persists for the Gaussian disorder considered here, pointing to a universal feature of 2D spin glasses. Conversely, the SK model retains a finite-variance distribution, with the disorder-averaged gap following a rather slow power law, close to $Δ\propto N^{-1/3}$. This finding provides a promising outlook for the potential efficiency of quantum annealers for optimization problems with dense connectivity.

Motivation: 时域静态响应虽受活性和熵产约束，但有限频率下时变扰动的扩展尚不明确，因此需要探索频域涨落-响应关系。

Method: 针对具有时变扰动的稳态马尔可夫过程，推导频域涨落-响应不等式。

Result: 发现势垒和熵扰动下频谱信噪比普遍受动力学活性限制；对于状态-电流观测值，信噪比受熵产生率限制；并使用F1-ATP酶模型验证推断熵产生率。

Conclusion: 这些有限频率不等式为从功率谱测量中推断耗散提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Fluctuation-response relations encode fundamental constraints on nonequilibrium systems. While time-domain static response is bounded by activity and entropy production, finite-frequency extensions for time-dependent perturbations remain largely unexplored. Here, we derive frequency-domain fluctuation-response inequalities for steady-state Markov processes with time-dependent perturbations. For barrier and entropic perturbations, the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is universally bounded by dynamical activity. Furthermore, for state-current observables, the SNR is bounded by the entropy production rate (EPR). We illustrate our results using the F1-ATPase model to infer EPR. These finite-frequency inequalities provide a practical route to infer dissipation from power spectra measurements.

Abstract: We formulate a phenomenological effective field theory in which biological intelligence emerges as a macroscopic order parameter sustained by continuous metabolic flux. By modeling cognition as a coarse-grained neural activity field governed by a variational free energy, we derive closed-form expressions for information capacity and structural susceptibility using a Gaussian maximum entropy approximation. The theory predicts a universal algebraic divergence of the susceptibility, $χ\sim K^{-3/2}$, as the structural stiffness $K$ approaches the instability threshold. The exponent $γ= 3/2$ is consistent with the mean-field branching process universality class, thereby providing a theoretical rationale for the observed avalanche size exponent $τ\approx 3/2$ in cortical dynamics without invoking microscopic equivalence. We identify adult cognition as a metabolically pinned non-equilibrium steady state maintained near the critical regime $Γ\equiv K/α\approx 1$ by continuous metabolic regulation, while pathological decline corresponds to a delocalization transition triggered by the violation of structural stability conditions. The framework generates concrete, falsifiable predictions for attention scaling, altered states of consciousness, and transcranial magnetic stimulation responses, each of which can be tested against existing neuroimaging and electrophysiological datasets.

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic geometry of classical and quantum ideal gases in the relativistic regime, with particular emphasis on the effects of particle mass and spatial dimensionality. Relativistic kinematics is incorporated through the full energy-momentum dispersion relation and the corresponding relativistic density of states. Using the Fisher-Rao information metric derived from the partition function, we analyze the thermodynamic curvature for Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein, and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Exact analytical expressions are obtained in two spatial dimensions, while the three-dimensional case is studied numerically. We show that the thermodynamic curvature preserves its characteristic sign-positive for bosons and negative for fermions; even in the relativistic regime, reflecting effective attractive and repulsive statistical interactions, respectively. A distinctive relativistic effect is the shift of curvature singularities from the non-relativistic critical point to a mass-dependent threshold at $μ=mc^{2}$. In addition, the relativistic Bose-Einstein condensation temperature is evaluated, revealing explicit mass-dependent corrections to the non-relativistic result. These findings provide a unified geometric perspective on relativistic statistical systems and clarify the interplay between quantum statistics, relativistic kinematics, and critical behavior.

Motivation: 验证Kibble-Zurek机制在量子临界点附近的普适性，探究缺陷产生与平衡临界性之间的真实关系。

Method: 基于准一维费米系统模型进行理论研究，分析系统通过量子临界点时的动力学行为。

Result: 发现缺陷密度可能比Kibble-Zurek预测更快地被抑制，即使经过临界点；而通过非临界点的淬火也可能出现常规Kibble-Zurek标度。

Conclusion: 明确了普遍存在的缺陷标度出现的动力学条件，厘清了缺陷产生与平衡临界性之间的非必然关联。

Abstract: When a system is swept through a quantum critical point (QCP), the Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts that the average number of topological defects follows a universal power-law scaling with the ramp time scale. This scaling behavior is determined by the equilibrium critical exponents of the underlying phase transition. We show that the correspondence between Kibble-Zurek scaling and quantum criticality does not hold generally. In particular, the defect density can exhibit a suppression faster than the Kibble-Zurek prediction even when the quench crosses a critical point, while conventional Kibble-Zurek scaling may persist for quenches through a non-critical point. Our results, based on models representative of a broad class of quasi-one-dimensional Fermi systems, identify the dynamical conditions under which universal defect scaling emerges and clarify the relation between defect generation and equilibrium criticality.
