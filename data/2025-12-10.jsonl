We posit that fundamental quantum mechanical operations, superposition, entanglement, interference, and measurement, naturally map to essential reasoning primitives such as hypothesis branching, constraint propagation, consistency enforcement, and decision making. The resulting framework combines quantum-inspired computation with differentiable optimization, enabling reasoning to emerge as a process of amplitude evolution and interference-driven selection of self-consistent states. We develop the mathematical foundation of QCRM, define its parameterized circuit architecture, and show how logical rules can be encoded as unitary transformations over proposition-qubit states. We further formalize a training objective grounded in classical gradient descent over circuit parameters and discuss simulation-based implementations on classical hardware. Finally, we propose the Quantum Reasoning Layer (QRL) as a differentiable hybrid component for composable reasoning models applicable to scientific, biomedical, and chemical inference domains."}

In this setting the bivector $J = e_{12}$ satisfies $J^{2} = -1$ and supplies the complex structure on a minimal left ideal via right-multiplication, while Pauli operations arise as left actions of suitable Clifford elements. Adopting a canonical stabilizer mapping, the $N$-qubit computational basis state $|0\\cdots 0\\rangle$ is represented natively by a tensor product of real algebraic idempotents.

We investigate an external-field-driven qubit QB coupled to a harmonic oscillator catalyst, revealing a key thermodynamic mechanism: the catalyst induces transient negative heat flow ($J(t)<0$, or energy backflow) into the battery. This backflow actively counters dephasing losses, rapidly pushing the qubit into non-passive states, and results in a drastic enhancement of extractable work (Ergotropy). Leveraging the quantum first law, we precisely quantify this causal link between negative heat flux and QB performance enhancement. Our work uncovers the fundamental role of transient thermodynamic backflow in quantum catalysis, offering a crucial blueprint for high-performance quantum energy storage devices."}

By incorporating a broader representation-theoretic perspective, we provide a generalized framework that allows the code designer to take this structure into account. For any representation of a finite group, we produce a quantum code with a code space invariant under the group action, providing passive error mitigation against errors belonging to the image of the representation. Furthermore, errors outside this scope are detected and diagnosed by performing a projective measurement onto the isotypic components corresponding to irreducible representations of the chosen group, effectively generalizing syndrome extraction to symmetry-resolved quantum measurements. We show that all stabilizer codes are a special case of this construction, including qudit stabilizer codes, and show that there is a natural one logical qubit code associated to the dihedral group. Thus we provide a unifying framework for existing codes while simultaneously facilitating symmetry-aware codes tailored to specific systems."}

Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines.

Recent work on adaptive parallel reasoning aims to improve inference efficiency by decomposing the problem-solving process into concurrent reasoning threads when beneficial. However, existing methods on realistic tasks are either limited to supervised behavior cloning or exhibit significant accuracy drops compared to widely-used sequential long chain-of-thought (CoT) baselines. Moreover, many require customized inference engines, complicating deployment. We introduce ThreadWeaver, a framework for adaptive parallel reasoning that achieves accuracy on par with popular sequential reasoning models of comparable size while significantly reducing inference latency. ThreadWeaver's performance stems from three key innovations: 1) a two-stage parallel trajectory generator that produces large-scale, high-quality CoT data with parallel annotations for supervised fine-tuning; 2) a trie-based training-inference co-design that enables parallel reasoning on any off-the-shelf autoregressive inference engine without modifying position embeddings or KV caches; and 3) a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework that teaches the model to balance accuracy with effective parallelization. Across six challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ThreadWeaver trained atop Qwen3-8B achieves accuracy comparable to cutting-edge sequential reasoning models (71.9% on average and 79.9% on AIME24) while delivering up to 1.53x average speedup in token latency, establishing a new Pareto frontier between accuracy and efficiency."}

This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks."}

The competition of this effect and the intrinsic magnetic stiffness of the ferromagnet leads to a second order phase transition between uniform and non-uniform magnetic states. Using the quasiclassical Usadel equation, we derive the Landau functional for this transition and construct the complete phase diagram of the effect. We identify a special point of \"resonance\" at which the characteristic energy scale of the proximity effect equals the exchange field of the ferromagnet. At this point, the uniform magnetic state is unstable even in the limit of large stiffness. We further explore the parameter regime far beyond the transition and determine the properties of the resulting strongly non-uniform magnetic state."}

They are free-fermionic ($N=2$) and free-parafermionic ($N\\geq 2$) quantum chains. The essential ingredient that implies the free-particle spectra is the fact that these Hamiltonians are expressed in terms of generators of a $Z(N)$ exchange algebra. In all these known quantum chains the number of spins in all the multispin interactions (range of interactions) is the same and therefore, the models have homogeneous interacting range. In this paper we extend the $Z(N)$ exchange algebra, by introducing new models with a free-particle spectra, where the interaction ranges of the multispin interactions are not uniform anymore and depends on the lattice sites (non-homogeneous interacting range). We obtain the general conditions that the site-dependent ranges of the multispin interactions have to satisfy to ensure a free-particle spectra. Several simple examples are introduced. We study in detail the critical properties in the case where the range of interactions of the even (odd) sites are constant. The dynamical critical exponent is evaluated in several cases."}

In long-tailed regimes, however, severe sample imbalance tends to prevent the emergence of the NC phenomenon, resulting in poor generalization performance. Current efforts predominantly seek to recover the ETF geometry by imposing constraints on features or classifier weights, yet overlook a critical problem: There is a pronounced misalignment between the feature and the classifier weight spaces. In this paper, we theoretically quantify the harm of such misalignment through an optimal error exponent analysis. Built on this insight, we propose three explicit alignment strategies that plug-and-play into existing long-tail methods without architectural change. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, and ImageNet-LT datasets consistently boost examined baselines and achieve the state-of-the-art performances."}

However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed.

We illustrate this general principle by explicit microscopic model calculations, showing that this mechanism very effectively stabilizes disordered Wigner lattices to much higher temperatures and densities than in the clean limit.

We show that when the self-propulsion of an agent depends on internal variables with their own complex dynamics - modulated by local environmental cues - environmental memory spontaneously emerges and gives rise to new classes of behaviours. These include memory-induced responses, adaptable localization in complex landscapes, suppression of motility-induced phase separation, and enhanced jamming transitions. Our results demonstrate how minimal information processing capabilities, intrinsic to non-equilibrium agents with internal states like living cells, can profoundly influence both individual and collective behaviours.

Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning.

Unlike previous approaches where the RG procedure is based on a priori notions on the system, our analysis follows a minimality principle, where no a priori assumption is made. We apply our approach to a spin-glass model built on a hierarchical lattice. In the RG decimation procedure, a novel order parameter spontaneously emerges from the system symmetries, and self-similarity features of the RG transformation only. This order parameter is the projection of the spin configurations on the ground state of the system. Kadanoff's majority rule for ferromagnetic systems is replaced by a more complex scheme, which involves such novel order parameter. The ground state thus acts as a pattern which translates spin configurations from one length scale to another. The rescaling RG procedure is based on a minimal, information-theory approach and, combined with the decimation, it yields a complete RG transformation.\n  Below the upper critical dimension, the predictions for the critical exponent $ν$, which describes the critical divergence of the correlation length, are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations from both this and previous studies. Overall, this study opens new avenues in the understanding of the critical ordering of realistic spin glasses, and it can be applied to spin-glass models on a cubic lattice and nearest-neighbor couplings which directly model spin-glass materials, such as AuFe, CuMn and other magnetic alloys."}

Our method is based on an entropy penalisation method proposed by Gomes and Valdinoci, which generalises the Cole-Hopf transform from quadratic to general convex Hamiltonians, allowing a reformulation of viscous Hamilton-Jacobi dynamics by a discrete-time linear dynamics which approximates a linear heat-like parabolic equation, and can also extend to continuous-time dynamics. This makes the method suitable for quantum simulation. The validity of these results hold for arbitrary nonlinearity that correspond to convex Hamiltonians, and for arbitrarily long times, thus obviating a chief obstacle in most quantum algorithms for nonlinear partial differential equations.

A key open question is how Berry curvature and, more generally, quantum geometry reshape crystallization. The discovery of two-dimensional materials with relatively flat bands and pronounced Berry curvature has added fresh urgency to this question. Recent mean-field studies have proposed a topological variant of the Wigner crystal, the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), with non-zero Chern number. However it remains unclear whether the AHC survives beyond the mean-field approximation. Here, we map out the ground-state phase diagram of the $λ$-jellium model - a simple model whose interaction strength and Berry curvature are independently tunable - using state-of-the-art neural-network variational Monte Carlo. The AHC is found to remain stable against quantum fluctuations. Surprisingly, quantum geometric effects are found to dramatically enhance crystallization. Both the AHC and the standard Wigner Crystal are stabilized at densities up to an order of magnitude above the critical density in the absence of quantum geometry, yet still significantly below the threshold predicted by mean-field theory. These striking results highlight the rich interplay between quantum fluctuations, quantum geometry, and crystallization, providing concrete guidance for experiments and enabling future explorations of fractionalized crystals and chiral superconductors."}

This model undergoes noise-induced transitions between four metastable attractors, forming recurrent but aperiodic ``Escher cycles,'' similar to the cyclic nucleation dynamics observed in the nonreciprocal Ising model. We calculate the quasipotential analytically to first order in nonreciprocality. We characterise it along a one-dimensional reaction coordinate that connects the attractors, and we also obtain the full two-dimensional landscape, at leading order in perturbation theory. The resulting landscapes feature flat regions and extended plateaus, together with non-differentiable switching lines. These singular structures arise from two geometric mechanisms: the handover of dominance between competing transition paths, and the competition between basins of attraction. The system provides a rare case where the geometry of nonequilibrium rare events can be fully resolved, and a simple analytically tractable example of a quasipotential in more than one coordinate that captures a rich set of nonequilibrium features."}

We illustrate this general principle by explicit microscopic model calculations, showing that this mechanism very effectively stabilizes disordered Wigner lattices to much higher temperatures and densities than in the clean limit. On the other hand, we argue that in two dimensions disorder significantly ``smears\" the melting transition, producing spatial coexistence of solid-like and liquid-like regions -- just as recently observed in STM experiments.

With three photons already, multiple pairwise combinations are possible, where each pair of photons can exhibit either bosonic, fermionic, or anyonic exchange symmetry. This gives rise to mixed symmetry systems that are not possible to achieve with two photon alone. We experimentally investigate how these symmetry configurations manifest themselves in the observed interference of three photons. We show that multi-photon interference can be effectively turned on and off by tuning the symmetry of the constituent pairs. The possibility of accessing and tuning new quantum statistics in a scalable photonic platform not only deepens our understanding of quantum systems, but is also highly relevant for quantum technologies that rely on quantum interference."}

For over a century, this question has been explored through examining violations of the empirical ``rectilinear diameter law'' for the subcritical coexistence curve, where asymmetry could generate singular corrections. Here, we extend this investigation to the supercritical regime. We propose a supercritical-subcritical correspondence, drawing a formal analogy between the subcritical coexistence curve and recently defined supercritical boundary lines ($L^\\pm$ lines). Our theory predicts that the linear mixing of physical fields - a hallmark of asymmetric systems - produces universal scaling corrections, with antisymmetric coefficients, in these supercritical loci.

Single-qubit control and readout have been demonstrated recently using SFQ circuits coupled to superconducting qubits. Experiments where the SFQ electronics are co-located with the qubit have suffered from excess decoherence and loss due to quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit. A previous experiment by our group showed that moving the control electronics to the 3 K stage of the dilution refrigerator avoided this source of decoherence in a high-coherence 3D transmon geometry. In this paper, we also generate the pulses at the 3 K stage but have optimized the qubit design and control lines for scalable 2D transmon devices. We directly compare the qubit lifetime $T_1$, coherence time $T_2^*$ and gate fidelity when the qubit is controlled by the Josephson pulse generator (JPG) circuit versus the TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations for $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, and agreement to within 10% for randomized benchmarking. We also performed interleaved randomized benchmarking on individual JPG gates demonstrating an average error per gate of $0.46$% showing good agreement with what is expected based on the qubit coherence and higher-state leakage.

Here, we develop a superconducting quantum processor that enables global mid-circuit measurement with an average quantum non-demolition (QND) fidelity of 98.7% and fast conditional feedback with a 200 ns real-time decision latency. Using this platform, we demonstrate the coexistence of an absorbing-state transition in the quantum channel and a measurement-induced entanglement transition at the level of individual quantum trajectories. For the absorbing-state transition, we experimentally extract a set of critical exponents at the transition point, which is in excellent agreement with the directed percolation universality class.

HSTMixer employs a hierarchical spatiotemporal mixing block to extract multi-resolution features through bottom-up aggregation and top-down propagation. Furthermore, an adaptive region mixer generates transformation matrices based on regional semantics, enabling our model to dynamically capture evolving spatiotemporal patterns for different regions. Extensive experiments conducted on four large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits competitive computational efficiency."}

Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called \"empowerment\" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. \"Empowerment\" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions."}

For this purpose, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) provides an established framework, whose scope crucially hinges on the availability of efficient quantum impurity solvers. Here we present a real-frequency impurity solver based on neural quantum states (NQS) combined with an operator-Lanczos construction. NQS are an asymptotically unbiased variational ground-state ansatz that employs neural networks to capture long-range correlations on complicated graph structures. We leverage this ability to solve multi-orbital impurity problems using a systematically improvable Segmented Commutator Operator-Lanczos (SCOL) construction. Our benchmarks on both the single-orbital Anderson model and the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori impurity Hamiltonian reveal excellent ground-state precision and the capacity to accurately resolve zero temperature spectral functions and self-energies. These results open avenues for extending DMFT to more challenging problems."}

The PMF is defined for an equilibrium ensemble, and generally it is not clear how to use it when the system is out of equilibrium and described by a (generalized) Langevin equation. We study a model where the system is a single particle (so there are no complications related to internal forces) and a non-trivial PMF is due to the presence of on-site (anchor) potentials applied to the bath particles. We found that the PMF does not merely replace the external potential, but also makes the dissipation kernel and statistical properties of noise dependent on the system's position. That dependence is determined by the internal bath and system-bath interactions and is a priori unknown. Therefore, in the general case the Langevin equation with the PMF is not closed and thus inoperable. However, for systems with linear forces the aforementioned dependence on the system's position may be canceled. As an example, we consider a model where the bath is formed by the Klein-Gordon chain, i. e. a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials. In that case, the generalized Langevin equation has the standard form with an external potential replaced by a quadratic PMF."}

However, as the input sequence varies, the computational bottlenecks in Transformer models exhibit dynamic behavior across stages, which calls for a cross-stage sparse acceleration strategy. Unfortunately, most existing sparse Transformer approaches are single-stage based, and their sparsity prediction mechanisms lead to significant power overhead when applied across multiple stages. To this end, this paper proposes a log-domain attention prediction algorithm-architecture co-design, named LAPA. First, an asymmetric leading one computing (ALOC) scheme is designed to eliminate expensive multiplications. Next, a mixed-precision multi-round shifting accumulation (MRSA) mechanism is further proposed to mitigate the accumulation overhead. A data-feature dependent filter (DDF) strategy is designed to work in concert with the MRSA process. Finally, an elaborate accelerator is designed to translate the theoretical enhancement into practical hardware improvement.

To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge graph-enhanced, Prototype-aware, and Interpretable (KPI) framework. KPI systematically integrates structured and trusted medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, and employs contrastive learning to enhance predictive accuracy, which is particularly important for long-tailed diseases. Additionally, KPI utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate patient-specific, medically relevant explanations, thereby improving interpretability and reliability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that KPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and provides clinically valid explanations that closely align with patient narratives, highlighting its practical value for patient-centered healthcare delivery."}

We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the actions, which allow us to determine the two conditions to get periodic closed trajectories. We classify these trajectories through the indices $(s,t,\\ell)$. The caustic paraboloids that bound the motion provide a complete geometric characterization of admissible trajectories. Quantum mechanically, separability of the Schrödinger equation in parabolic coordinates yields eigenmodes described by Whittaker functions. We determine the energy spectrum and identify degeneracies arising not only from azimuthal symmetry but also from specific cavity deformations. A direct correspondence between classical trajectories and quantum eigenstates reveals that probability densities concentrate in the classically allowed region with controlled penetration into forbidden zones."}

In layered materials hosting two-dimensional topological phases, elementary quasiparticles can diffuse freely within the layer, whereas only pairs (or more) can hop between layers - a fundamental consequence of topological order. Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity.

Unlike previous approaches where the RG procedure is based on a priori notions on the system, our analysis follows a minimality principle, where no a priori assumption is made. We apply our approach to a spin-glass model built on a hierarchical lattice. In the RG decimation procedure, a novel order parameter spontaneously emerges from the system symmetries, and self-similarity features of the RG transformation only. This order parameter is the projection of the spin configurations on the ground state of the system. Kadanoff's majority rule for ferromagnetic systems is replaced by a more complex scheme, which involves such novel order parameter. The ground state thus acts as a pattern which translates spin configurations from one length scale to another. The rescaling RG procedure is based on a minimal, information-theory approach and, combined with the decimation, it yields a complete RG transformation.\n  Below the upper critical dimension, the predictions for the critical exponent $ν$, which describes the critical divergence of the correlation length, are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations from both this and previous studies. Overall, this study opens new avenues in the understanding of the critical ordering of realistic spin glasses, and it can be applied to spin-glass models on a cubic lattice and nearest-neighbor couplings which directly model spin-glass materials, such as AuFe, CuMn and other magnetic alloys."}

While this enables studies of many-body physics, it limits the flexibility and tunability of the system as a quantum platform. Here, we demonstrate an array of trapped ions in individual trapping sites whose motional modes can be controllably coupled and decoupled by tuning the local applied confining potential for each ion. We show that a single motional quantum, or phonon, can be coherently shared among two or three ions confined at the vertices of an equilateral triangle 30 $μ$m on a side. We can adiabatically tune the ion participation in the motional modes around a closed contour in configuration space, observing that the single-phonon wavefunction acquires a topological Berry phase if the contour encircles a conical intersection of motional eigenvalue surfaces. We observe this phase by single-phonon interference and study its breakdown as the motional mode tuning becomes non-adiabiatic.

(3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%. The framework predicts the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of held-out configurations, providing a predictive principle of agentic scaling based on measurable task properties."}

Expanding their materials palette can improve performance, extend operating regimes, and introduce new functionalities, but conventional thin-film fabrication hinders systematic exploration of new material combinations. Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a highly modular crystalline platform that facilitates such exploration while enabling gate-tunability, higher-temperature operation, and compact qubit geometries. Yet it remains unknown whether a fully vdW superconducting qubit can support quantum coherence and what mechanisms dominate loss at both low and elevated temperatures in such a device. Here we demonstrate quantum-coherent merged-element transmons made entirely from vdW Josephson junctions. These first-generation, fully crystalline qubits achieve microsecond lifetimes in an ultra-compact footprint without external shunt capacitors. Energy relaxation measurements, together with microwave characterization of vdW capacitors, point to dielectric loss as the dominant relaxation channel up to hundreds of millikelvin. These results establish vdW materials as a viable platform for compact superconducting quantum devices."}

In layered materials hosting two-dimensional topological phases, elementary quasiparticles can diffuse freely within the layer, whereas only pairs (or more) can hop between layers - a fundamental consequence of topological order. Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity.

However, existing methods are typically structured around scoring individual points or simple pairs. Such {point- or pair-centric} view not only overlooks the contextual nature of anomalies, which are defined by their deviation from a collective group, but also fails to exploit the rich supervisory signals that can be generated from the combinatorial composition of sets. Consequently, such models struggle to exploit the high-order interactions within the data, which are critical for learning discriminative representations. To address these limitations, we propose SetAD, a novel framework that reframes semi-supervised AD as a Set-level Anomaly Detection task. SetAD employs an attention-based set encoder trained via a graded learning objective, where the model learns to quantify the degree of anomalousness within an entire set. This approach directly models the complex group-level interactions that define anomalies. Furthermore, to enhance robustness and score calibration, we propose a context-calibrated anomaly scoring mechanism, which assesses a point's anomaly score by aggregating its normalized deviations from peer behavior across multiple, diverse contextual sets. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that SetAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, we show that our model's performance consistently improves with increasing set size, providing strong empirical support for the set-based formulation of anomaly detection."}

Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems."}

While the mathematical theory underpinning quantum correlations between spacelike separated systems has been well-established since the 1930s, the mathematical theory for correlations between non-spacelike separated systems is much less developed. In this work, we develop the theory of what we refer to as \"local-density operators\", which we view as joint states for possibly non-spacelike separated quantum systems. Local-density operators are unit trace operators whose marginals are genuine density operators, which we show not only subsumes the notion of density operator, but also several extensions of the notion of density operator into the spatiotemporal domain, such as pseudo-density operators and quantum states over time. More importantly, we prove a result which establishes a one-to-one correspondence between local-density operators and what we refer to as \"Dirac measures\", which are complex-valued measures on the space of separable projectors associated with two quantum systems. In the case that one of the systems is the trivial quantum system with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, our result recovers the fundamental result known as Gleason's Theorem, which implies that the Born rule from quantum theory is the only way in which one may assign probabilities to the outcomes of measurements performed on quantum systems in a non-contextual manner. As such, our results establish a direct generalization of Gleason's Theorem to measurements performed on possibly non-spacelike separated systems, thus extending the mathematical theory of quantum correlations across space to quantum correlations across space and time."}

Our methodology, applied to 100,000 trade records, combines several ML techniques. Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means) discovers natural trade archetypes based on shipment value and weight. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest and IQR) identifies rare \"mega-trades\" and shipments with commercially unusual price-per-kilogram values. This is supplemented by Heuristic Flagging to find tactics like vague shipment descriptions. These layers are combined into a priority score, which successfully identified 1,351 price outliers and 1,288 high-priority shipments for customs review. A key finding is that high-priority commodities show a different and more valuable value-to-weight ratio than general goods. This was validated using Explainable AI (SHAP), which confirmed vague descriptions and high value as the most significant risk predictors. The model's sensitivity was validated by its detection of a massive spike in \"mega-trades\" in early 2021, correlating directly with the real-world regulatory impact of the US AIM Act.

Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in Türkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test). These outcomes highlight the model's powerful nonlinear mapping ability, making it a promising tool for predictive geotechnical tasks. The study supports the integration of intelligent, data-centric models in geotechnical engineering, offering an effective alternative to traditional methods and promoting digital transformation in infrastructure analysis and design."}

This framework allows us to introduce information-theoretic measures that quantify the correlations between the system and the memory. Furthermore, we develop a general framework to characterize the statistics of the memory -- such as moments, cumulants, and correlation functions -- which can be applied both to general feedback-control protocols and to monitored systems without feedback.

These life trajectories combine demographic information with annual changes in residence, work, education, income, and family circumstances, allowing us to assess how effectively such sequences support longitudinal prediction. We compare multiple NLP architectures (including LSTM, DistilBERT, BERT, and Qwen) and find that sequential and transformer-based models capture temporal and semantic structure more effectively than baseline models. The results show that textualized register data preserves meaningful information about individual pathways and supports complex, scalable modeling. Because few countries maintain longitudinal microdata with comparable coverage and precision, this dataset enables analyses and methodological tests that would be difficult or impossible elsewhere, offering a rigorous testbed for developing and evaluating new sequence-modeling approaches. Overall, our findings demonstrate that combining semantically rich register data with modern language models can substantially advance longitudinal analysis in social sciences."}

Traditional methods for determining optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) involve labor-intensive laboratory experiments, and empirical regression models have limited applicability and accuracy across diverse soil types.

This study proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict OMC and MDD. AutoML automates algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization, potentially improving accuracy and scalability. Through extensive experimentation, the study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm provided the best performance, achieving R-squared values of 80.4% for MDD and 89.1% for OMC on a separate dataset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoML in predicting compaction parameters across different soil types. The study also highlights the importance of heterogeneous datasets in improving the generalization and performance of ML models. Ultimately, this research contributes to more efficient and reliable construction practices by enhancing the prediction of soil compaction parameters."}

The wide adoption in numerous applications underscores the value of these models. However, the complexity of these methods often impedes understanding their decision-making processes.

Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings.

In many scientific and engineering settings the response is functional, varying smoothly over an index such as time or wavelength, which makes classical formulations inadequate. Existing methods often minimize integrated error, which captures average performance but neglects worst case deviations. To address this limitation we propose min-max Functional Bayesian Optimization (MM-FBO), a framework that directly minimizes the maximum error across the functional domain. Functional responses are represented using functional principal component analysis, and Gaussian process surrogates are constructed for the principal component scores. Building on this representation, MM-FBO introduces an integrated uncertainty acquisition function that balances exploitation of worst case expected error with exploration across the functional domain. We provide two theoretical guarantees: a discretization bound for the worst case objective, and a consistency result showing that as the surrogate becomes accurate and uncertainty vanishes, the acquisition converges to the true min-max objective. We validate the method through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and physics inspired case studies involving electromagnetic scattering by metaphotonic devices and vapor phase infiltration. Results show that MM-FBO consistently outperforms existing baselines and highlights the importance of explicitly modeling functional uncertainty in Bayesian optimization."}

The unique characteristics of the physiological time series signals, such as multivariate, high temporal variability, highly noisy, and artifact-prone, make deep learning-based approaches still challenging for tasks such as imputation. Hence, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based noise estimator within a score-based diffusion framework. Specifically, the Receptive Field Adaptive MoE (RFAMoE) module is designed to enable each channel to adap- tively select desired receptive fields throughout the diffusion process. Moreover, recent literature has found that when generating a physiological signal, performing multiple inferences and averaging the reconstructed signals can effectively reduce reconstruction errors, but at the cost of significant computational and latency over- head. We design a Fusion MoE module and innovatively leverage the nature of MoE module to generate K noise signals in parallel, fuse them using a routing mechanism, and complete signal reconstruction in a single inference step. This design not only improves performance over previous methods but also eliminates the substantial computational cost and latency associated with multiple inference processes.

The protocol is highly scalable for models with local interactions and is in principle insensitive to state-preparation errors. At its core, the protocol forms a linear system of equations for the model parameters in terms of a set of observable values and their gradients. The required gradient information is obtained by fitting time-series data with sums of exponentially damped sinusoids and differentiating those curves. We develop a robust curve-fitting procedure that finds the most parsimonious representation of the data up to shot noise. We demonstrate the approach by learning the Lindbladian for a full layer of gates on a 156-qubit superconducting quantum processor, providing the first learning experiment of this kind. We study the effects of state-preparation and measurement errors and limitations on the operations that can be learned. For improved performance under readout errors, we propose an optional fine-tuning strategy that improves the fit between the time-evolved model and the measured data."}

A key challenge lies in simulating environment agents, including background vehicles (BVs) and vulnerable road users (VRUs), that behave realistically in nominal traffic while also exhibiting risk-prone behaviors consistent with real-world accidents. We introduce Controllable Risk Agent Generation (CRAG), a framework designed to unify the modeling of dominant nominal behaviors and rare safety-critical behaviors. CRAG constructs a structured latent space that disentangles normal and risk-related behaviors, enabling efficient use of limited crash data. By combining risk-aware latent representations with optimization-based mode-transition mechanisms, the framework allows agents to shift smoothly and plausibly from safe to risk states over extended horizons, while maintaining high fidelity in both regimes. Extensive experiments show that CRAG improves diversity compared to existing baselines, while also enabling controllable generation of risk scenarios for targeted and efficient evaluation of AV robustness."}

Machine learning models used in these applications often rely on features extracted from biosignals due to their effectiveness, lower data dimensionality, and wide compatibility across various model architectures. However, existing feature extraction methods often lack task-specific contextual knowledge, struggle to identify optimal feature extraction settings in high-dimensional feature space, and are prone to code generation and automation errors. In this paper, we propose DeepFeature, the first LLM-empowered, context-aware feature generation framework for wearable biosignals. DeepFeature introduces a multi-source feature generation mechanism that integrates expert knowledge with task settings. It also employs an iterative feature refinement process that uses feature assessment-based feedback for feature re-selection. Additionally, DeepFeature utilizes a robust multi-layer filtering and verification approach for robust feature-to-code translation to ensure that the extraction functions run without crashing. Experimental evaluation results show that DeepFeature achieves an average AUROC improvement of 4.21-9.67% across eight diverse tasks compared to baseline methods.

In these protocols, pre-shared entanglement enables either the faithful transfer of quantum states or the transmission of more information than is possible classically. However, channel losses degrade the shared states, reducing teleportation fidelity and the information advantage in superdense coding. Here, we investigate how to mitigate these effects by optimising the measurements applied by the communicating parties. We formulate the problem as an optimisation over general positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) and compare the results with physically realisable noiseless attenuation (NA) and noiseless linear amplification (NLA) circuits. For teleportation, NLA/NA and optimised POVMs improve the average fidelity by up to 78% while maintaining feasible success probabilities. For superdense coding, they enhance the quantum advantage over the classical channel capacity by more than 100% in some regimes and shift the break-even point, thereby extending the tolerable range of losses. Notably, the optimal POVMs effectively reduce to NA or NLA, showing that simple, experimentally accessible operations already capture the essential performance gains."}

Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines.

Conventional latent world models typically employ monolithic neural networks that enforce global continuity, inevitably over-smoothing the distinct dynamic modes (e.g., sticking vs. sliding, flight vs. stance). For a planner, this smoothing results in catastrophic compounding errors during long-horizon lookaheads, rendering the search process unreliable at physical boundaries. To address this, we introduce the Prismatic World Model (PRISM-WM), a structured architecture designed to decompose complex hybrid dynamics into composable primitives. PRISM-WM leverages a context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework where a gating mechanism implicitly identifies the current physical mode, and specialized experts predict the associated transition dynamics. We further introduce a latent orthogonalization objective to ensure expert diversity, effectively preventing mode collapse. By accurately modeling the sharp mode transitions in system dynamics, PRISM-WM significantly reduces rollout drift. Extensive experiments on challenging continuous control benchmarks, including high-dimensional humanoids and diverse multi-task settings, demonstrate that PRISM-WM provides a superior high-fidelity substrate for trajectory optimization algorithms (e.g., TD-MPC), proving its potential as a powerful foundational model for next-generation model-based agents."}

In this work, we develop a framework that characterizes and quantifies the programmability of Lindbladian semigroups by combining physically implementable retrieval maps with time varying program states. Within this framework, we identify quantum programmable classes enabled by symmetry and stochastic structure, including covariant semigroups and fully dissipative Pauli Lindbladians with finite program dimension. We further provide a necessary condition for physical programmability that rules out coherent generators and typical dissipators generating amplitude damping. For such nonphysically programmable cases, we construct explicit protocols with finite resources. Finally, we introduce an operational programming cost, defined via the number of samples required to program the Lindbladian, and establish its core structural properties, such as continuity and faithfulness. These results provide a notion of programming cost for Lindbladians, bridge programmable channel theory and open system dynamics, and yield symmetry driven compression schemes and actionable resource estimates for semigroup simulation and control in noisy quantum technologies."}

Current approaches predominantly optimize technical performance metrics while neglecting the sociotechnical dimensions of AI deployment. IDAIF addresses this gap by establishing a systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and corresponding AI architectural layers (Data Layer-Pipeline Layer-Inference Layer-Agentic Layer-Normative Layer). Each layer incorporates rigorous theoretical foundations: multi-objective Pareto optimization for value alignment, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration for outcome achievement, causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for hallucination mitigation, and adversarial debiasing with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fairness assurance. We provide formal mathematical formulations for each component and introduce an Assurance Layer that manages assumption failures through guardian architectures.

To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity."}

By analyzing the linear entanglement entropy of coherent states prepared in the classical chaotic and regular regions of the semiclassical phase space, we demonstrate that quantum-classical correspondence can be achieved in the RSM with large atom-light frequency ratios. While this correspondence fails in the resonant Rabi model because its truncated photon number is insufficient to approach the large quantum number limit, we discovered that in the resonant RSM when the nonlinear Stark coupling $U \\to \\pm 1$, the time-averaged linear entanglement entropy correlates strongly with the semiclassical phase space. In particular, when $U \\to -1$, the truncated photon number in the resonant RSM is very close to that in the resonant Rabi model, but the time-averaged linear entanglement entropy still corresponds well with the semiclassical phase space. This result demonstrates that quantum-classical correspondence can be realized in the few-body resonant RSM."}

Existing algorithms, however, are typically derived from optimization viewpoints and do not explicitly exploit the conic geometry induced by NMF: data points lie in a convex cone whose extreme rays encode fundamental directions or \"topics\". In this work we revisit NMF from this geometric perspective and propose Cone Collapse, an algorithm that starts from the full nonnegative orthant and iteratively shrinks it toward the minimal cone generated by the data. We prove that, under mild assumptions on the data, Cone Collapse terminates in finitely many steps and recovers the minimal generating cone of $\\mathbf{X}^\\top$ . Building on this basis, we then derive a cone-aware orthogonal NMF model (CC-NMF) by applying uni-orthogonal NMF to the recovered extreme rays. Across 16 benchmark gene-expression, text, and image datasets, CC-NMF consistently matches or outperforms strong NMF baselines-including multiplicative updates, ANLS, projective NMF, ONMF, and sparse NMF-in terms of clustering purity.

However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semi-supervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic unmanned air vehicles (UAV) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions.

In this work, we demonstrate deterministic quantum state transfer and remote entanglement generation between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits on separate chips. To compensate for the sender-receiver mismatch, we employ a frequency-tunable photon-generation technique which enables us to adjust the photon frequency without modifying circuit parameters. To enhance the frequency tunability, we implement broadband transfer resonators composed of two coupled coplanar-waveguide resonators, achieving a bandwidth of more than 100 MHz. This broadband design enables successful quantum communication across a 30-MHz range of photon frequencies between the remote qubits.

Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) addresses this by replacing quadratic self-attention with a line-scan propagation scheme, bringing the cost close to linear in the number of rows or columns, while retaining accuracy. Despite this advancement, the existing GSPN implementation still suffers from (i) heavy overhead due to repeatedly launching GPU kernels, (ii) excessive data transfers from global GPU memory, and (iii) redundant computations caused by maintaining separate propagation weights for each channel. We introduce GSPN-2, a joint algorithm-system redesign. In particular, we eliminate thousands of micro-launches from the previous implementation into one single 2D kernel, explicitly pin one warp to each channel slice, and stage the previous column's activations in shared memory. On the model side, we introduce a compact channel propagation strategy that replaces per-channel matrices, trimming parameters, and align naturally with the affinity map used in transformer attention. Experiments demonstrate GSPN-2's effectiveness across image classification and text-to-image synthesis tasks, matching transformer-level accuracy with significantly lower computational cost. GSPN-2 establishes a new efficiency frontier for modeling global spatial context in vision applications through its unique combination of structured matrix transformations and GPU-optimized implementation.

A key challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where learning new information causes the model to lose its performance on previous tasks. Recently, explainable AI has been proposed as a promising way to better understand and reduce forgetting. In particular, self-explainable models are useful because they generate explanations during prediction, which can help preserve knowledge. However, most existing explainable approaches use post-hoc explanations or require additional memory for each new task, resulting in limited scalability. In this work, we introduce CIP-Net, an exemplar-free self-explainable prototype-based model designed for continual learning. CIP-Net avoids storing past examples and maintains a simple architecture, while still providing useful explanations and strong performance. We demonstrate that CIPNet achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to previous exemplar-free and self-explainable methods in both task- and class-incremental settings, while bearing significantly lower memory-related overhead.

In this paper, we reformulate the unstructured search as a maximization problem on the unitary manifold and solve it via the Riemannian gradient ascent (RGA) method. To overcome the difficulty that generic RGA updates do not, in general, correspond to physically implementable quantum operators, we introduce Grover-compatible retractions to restrict RGA updates to valid oracle and diffusion operators. Theoretically, we establish a local Riemannian $μ$-Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) inequality with $μ= \\tfrac{1}{2}$, which yields a linear convergence rate of $1 - κ^{-1}$ toward the global solution. Here, the condition number $κ= L_{\\mathrm{Rie}} / μ$, where $L_{\\mathrm{Rie}}$ denotes the Riemannian Lipschitz constant of the gradient. Taking into account both the geometry of the unitary manifold and the special structure of the cost function, we show that $L_{\\mathrm{Rie}} = O(\\sqrt{N})$ for problem size $N = 2^n$. Consequently, the resulting iteration complexity is $O(\\sqrt{N} \\log(1/\\varepsilon))$ for attaining an $\\varepsilon$-accurate solution, which matches the quadratic speedup of $O(\\sqrt{N})$ achieved by Grover's algorithm.

Its non-Gaussian resources, essential for outperforming any classical system, are provided by single-photon inputs and click detection. Yet the drive toward larger experiments has led to the replacement of experimentally demanding single-photon sources with Gaussian states, thereby diminishing the available non-Gaussianity-a critical quantum resource. As the community broadens its focus from the initial sampling task to possible real-world applications, it becomes crucial to quantify the performance cost associated with reducing non-Gaussian resources and to benchmark sampling platforms that employ different input states.\n  To address this need, we introduce the Paderborn Quantum Sampler (PaQS), a hybrid platform capable of performing sampling experiments with eight Gaussian or non-Gaussian input states in a 12-mode interferometer within a single experimental run. This architecture enables direct, side-by-side benchmarking of distinct sampling regimes under otherwise identical conditions. By employing a semi-device-independent framework, offering certification that does not rely on prior knowledge of the interferometer or the input states, we verify that the observed data cannot be reproduced by any classical model-a prerequisite for demonstrating quantum advantage.

Single-objective Reinforcement Learning approaches typically address this by optimizing a fixed scalarized reward function, resulting in rigid policies that fail to adapt to varying clinical priorities. Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) offers a solution by learning a set of optimal policies along the Pareto Frontier, allowing for dynamic preference selection at test time. However, applying MORL in healthcare necessitates strict offline learning from historical data.\n  In this paper, we benchmark three offline MORL algorithms, Conditioned Conservative Pareto Q-Learning (CPQL), Adaptive CPQL, and a modified Pareto Efficient Decision Agent (PEDA) Decision Transformer (PEDA DT), against three scalarized single-objective baselines (BC, CQL, and DDQN) on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) metrics, we demonstrate that PEDA DT algorithm offers superior flexibility compared to static scalarized baselines. Notably, our results extend previous findings on single-objective Decision Transformers in healthcare, confirming that sequence modeling architectures remain robust and effective when scaled to multi-objective conditioned generation.

While world models (WMs) offer a paradigm for generative prediction, existing medical applications remain limited. Existing methods often rely on stochastic diffusion models, focusing on visual reconstruction rather than causal, physiological transitions. Furthermore, in medical domain, models like MeWM typically ignore patient-specific temporal and clinical contexts and lack a feedback mechanism to link predictions to treatment decisions. To address these gaps, we introduce CLARITY, a medical world model that forecasts disease evolution directly within a structured latent space. It explicitly integrates time intervals (temporal context) and patient-specific data (clinical context) to model treatment-conditioned progression as a smooth, interpretable trajectory, and thus generate physiologically faithful, individualized treatment plans. Finally, CLARITY introduces a novel prediction-to-decision framework, translating latent rollouts into transparent, actionable recommendations. CLARITY demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in treatment planning. On the MU-Glioma-Post dataset, our approach outperforms recent MeWM by 12\\%, and significantly surpasses all other medical-specific large language models."}

When mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), they benefit from flexible deployment and improved line-of-sight conditions. Despite their promising potential, a comprehensive performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS architectures has not been thoroughly investigated. This letter presents a detailed performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS in three-dimensional wireless environments. Accurate channel models incorporating directional radiation patterns are established, and the influence of deployment altitude and orientation is thoroughly examined. To optimize the system sum-rate, we formulate joint optimization problems for both architectures and propose an efficient solution based on the weighted minimum mean square error and block coordinate descent algorithms. Simulation results reveal that STAR-RIS outperforms RIS in low-altitude scenarios due to its full-space coverage capability, whereas RIS delivers better performance near the base station at higher altitudes. The findings provide practical insights for the deployment of aerial intelligent surfaces in future 6G communication systems."}

Yet their generation remains fundamentally constrained: in the absence of intrinsic photon-photon interactions, the generation of such states is inherently probabilistic rather than deterministic. The prevalent technique of post-selection verifies the creation of an entangled state by detecting and thus destroying it. Heralding offers a solution in which measuring ancillary photons in auxiliary modes signals the state generation without the need to measure it. Here, we report an experiment to generate a three-mode two-photon NOON state, where the detection of a single photon in one heralding mode signifies the presence of the state in three target modes. We validate the generated state by estimating a fidelity of 0.823 +/- 0.018 with respect to an ideal three-mode NOON state and certifying genuine multipartite entanglement. By virtue of the high success probability and small resource overhead of our scheme, our work provides a theoretical and experimental stepping stone for entangled multi-mode state generation, which is realizable with current technology. These multi-mode entangled states represent a key direction for linear optical quantum information that is complementary to multi-qubit state encoding."}

This reliance on static, data-agnostic kernels creates a fundamental trade-off, forcing practitioners to sacrifice significant model accuracy for computational efficiency. We introduce \\textsc{LUNA}, a kernelized linear attention mechanism that eliminates this trade-off, retaining linear cost while matching and surpassing the accuracy of quadratic attention. \\textsc{LUNA} is built on the key insight that the kernel feature map itself should be learned rather than fixed a priori. By parameterizing the kernel, \\textsc{LUNA} learns a feature basis tailored to the specific data and task, overcoming the expressive limitations of fixed-feature methods. \\textsc{Luna} implements this with a learnable feature map that induces a positive-definite kernel and admits a streaming form, yielding linear time and memory scaling in the sequence length. Empirical evaluations validate our approach across diverse settings. On the Long Range Arena (LRA), \\textsc{Luna} achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy among efficient Transformers under compute parity, using the same parameter count, training steps, and approximate FLOPs. \\textsc{Luna} also excels at post-hoc conversion: replacing softmax in fine-tuned BERT and ViT-B/16 checkpoints and briefly fine-tuning recovers most of the original performance, substantially outperforming fixed linearizations."}

Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow.

Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations.

We offer a structural explanation from minimal constraints on finite descriptions of admissible histories. Assume that histories admit finite, self-delimiting (prefix-free) generative codes that can be decoded sequentially in a single forward pass. These purely syntactic requirements define a minimal descriptive cost, interpretable as a smoothed minimal program length, that is additive over local segments. First, any continuous local additive cost whose stationary sector coincides with the empirically identified classical variational sector is forced into a unique Euler--Lagrange equivalence class. Hence the universal form of an action is fixed by descriptional structure alone, while the specific microscopic Lagrangian and couplings remain system-dependent semantic input. Second, independently of microscopic stochasticity, finite prefix-free languages exhibit exponential redundancy: many distinct programs encode the same coarse history, and this redundancy induces a universal exponential multiplicity weight on histories. Requiring this weight to be real and bounded below selects a real Euclidean representative for stable local bosonic systems, yielding the standard Euclidean path-integral form. When Osterwalder--Schrader reflection positivity holds, the Euclidean measure reconstructs a unitary Lorentzian amplitude."}

However, the wide variation in crisis types makes achieving generalizable performance across unseen disasters a persistent challenge. Existing approaches primarily leverage deep learning to fuse textual and visual cues for crisis classification, achieving numerically plausible results under in-domain settings. However, they exhibit poor generalization across unseen crisis types because they 1. do not disentangle spurious and causal features, resulting in performance degradation under domain shift, and 2. fail to align heterogeneous modality representations within a shared space, which hinders the direct adaptation of established single-modality domain generalization (DG) techniques to the multimodal setting. To address these issues, we introduce a causality-guided multimodal domain generalization (MMDG) framework that combines adversarial disentanglement with unified representation learning for crisis classification. The adversarial objective encourages the model to disentangle and focus on domain-invariant causal features, leading to more generalizable classifications grounded in stable causal mechanisms. The unified representation aligns features from different modalities within a shared latent space, enabling single-modality DG strategies to be seamlessly extended to multimodal learning. Experiments on the different datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance in unseen disaster scenarios."}

Double homodyne detection provides a powerful method for the direct measurement of the Husimi Q quasi-probability distribution, offering a complete state representation in a simple experimental setting and a limited time frame. Here, we demonstrate that double homodyne detection can serve as more than a passive measurement apparatus. By intentionally unbalancing the input beamsplitter that splits the quantum signal, we show that the detection scheme itself performs an effective squeezing or anti-squeezing transformation on the state being measured. The resulting measurement directly samples the Q function of the input state as if it were acted upon by a squeezing operator whose strength is a tunable experimental parameter : the beamsplitter's reflectivity. We experimentally realize this technique using a robust polarization-encoded double homodyne detection to characterize a squeezed vacuum state. Our results demonstrate the controlled deformation of the measured Q function's phase-space distribution, confirming that unbalanced double homodyne detection is a versatile tool for simultaneous quantum state manipulation and characterization."}

Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR).

The setup consists of a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere, which in turn are hybridized with a vibrational mechanical mode through magnetostrictive interaction. In the Hermitian regime, strong photon-magnon coupling generates a single transparency window in the cavity transmission, which splits into a doublet when the magnon is coherently hybridized with the mechanical mode via magnomechanical coupling. This establishes a versatile platform in which the transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response using experimentally accessible, scaled magnomechanical interactions. When a non-Hermitian coupling is introduced, the system enters a parity-time-broken regime in which the transparency ceases to be purely passive and becomes gain assisted, leading to asymmetric transmission with amplification on one side of the resonance and enhanced absorption on the other. By tuning the cavity detuning, we convert magnomechanical transparency into Fano-type line shapes with strongly non-Lorentzian phase dispersion and map their deformation into asymmetric, gain-assisted Fano ridges in the joint space of probe and magnon detunings. Finally, we analyze the associated group delay and show that both slow- and fast-light behavior can be widely tuned by varying the photon-magnon and magnomechanical couplings together with the non-Hermitian strength, highlighting parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a promising platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing."}

Such dishonesty may arise due to the effects of reinforcement learning (RL), where challenges with reward shaping can result in a training process that inadvertently incentivizes the model to lie or misrepresent its actions.\n  In this work we propose a method for eliciting an honest expression of an LLM's shortcomings via a self-reported *confession*. A confession is an output, provided upon request after a model's original answer, that is meant to serve as a full account of the model's compliance with the letter and spirit of its policies and instructions. The reward assigned to a confession during training is solely based on its honesty, and does not impact positively or negatively the main answer's reward. As long as the \"path of least resistance\" for maximizing confession reward is to surface misbehavior rather than covering it up, this incentivizes models to be honest in their confessions. Our findings provide some justification this empirical assumption, especially in the case of egregious model misbehavior.\n  To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we train GPT-5-Thinking to produce confessions, and we evaluate its honesty in out-of-distribution scenarios measuring hallucination, instruction following, scheming, and reward hacking. We find that when the model lies or omits shortcomings in its \"main\" answer, it often confesses to these behaviors honestly, and this confession honesty modestly improves with training. Confessions can enable a number of inference-time interventions including monitoring, rejection sampling, and surfacing issues to the user."}

Recent work on adaptive parallel reasoning aims to improve inference efficiency by decomposing the problem-solving process into concurrent reasoning threads when beneficial. However, existing methods on realistic tasks are either limited to supervised behavior cloning or exhibit significant accuracy drops compared to widely-used sequential long chain-of-thought (CoT) baselines. Moreover, many require customized inference engines, complicating deployment. We introduce ThreadWeaver, a framework for adaptive parallel reasoning that achieves accuracy on par with popular sequential reasoning models of comparable size while significantly reducing inference latency. ThreadWeaver's performance stems from three key innovations: 1) a two-stage parallel trajectory generator that produces large-scale, high-quality CoT data with parallel annotations for supervised fine-tuning; 2) a trie-based training-inference co-design that enables parallel reasoning on any off-the-shelf autoregressive inference engine without modifying position embeddings or KV caches; and 3) a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework that teaches the model to balance accuracy with effective parallelization. Across six challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ThreadWeaver trained atop Qwen3-8B achieves accuracy comparable to cutting-edge sequential reasoning models (71.9% on average and 79.9% on AIME24) while delivering up to 1.53x average speedup in token latency, establishing a new Pareto frontier between accuracy and efficiency."}

These prevalence estimates are produced by a classifier, either an LLM-as-a-judge or human annotators, making the choice of classifier central to trustworthy evaluation. Common metrics used for this choice, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1, are sensitive to class imbalance and to arbitrary choices of positive class, and can favor judges that distort prevalence estimates. We show that Youden's $J$ statistic is theoretically aligned with choosing the best judge to compare models, and that Balanced Accuracy is an equivalent linear transformation of $J$. Through both analytical arguments and empirical examples and simulations, we demonstrate how selecting judges using Balanced Accuracy leads to better, more robust classifier selection."}

To better understand this fragility, we ask a simple question: \\emph{do all actions contribute equally to failure?} Analyzing execution traces on $τ$-Bench (Airline/Retail) and SWE-Bench Verified, we decompose trajectories into \\emph{mutating} (environment-changing) vs.\\ non-mutating steps and formalize \\emph{decisive deviations}, earliest action, level divergences that flip success to failure. A logistic regression reveals that each additional deviation in a mutating action reduces the odds of success by upto $92\\%$ on Airline and upto $96\\%$ on Retail for SoTA models. In contrast, deviations in non-mutating actions have little to no effect. Errors also grow with context length as agents drift from role and act on stale constraints.

For more general, smooth potentials, we identify and exploit a natural small parameter: the density matrix becomes strongly quasidiagonal in the coordinate representation, with its off-diagonal width shrinking as the bath's spectral cutoff increases, providing a controlled parameter for accurate approximation. The framework is fully general: arbitrary initial quantum states-including highly non-classical superpositions-are incorporated via their Wigner functions, which serve as statistical weights for trajectory ensembles. Furthermore, the formalism naturally accommodates external manipulations and measurements modeled by preparation functions acting at arbitrary times, enabling the simulation of complex driven-dissipative quantum protocols."}

However, these approaches may fail: (1) when some (non-target) classes are easily discriminable from all others, in which case they may naturally achieve extreme detection statistics (e.g., decision confidence); and (2) when the backdoor is subtle, i.e., with its features weak relative to intrinsic class-discriminative features. A key observation is that the backdoor target class has contributions to its detection statistic from both the backdoor trigger and from its intrinsic features, whereas non-target classes only have contributions from their intrinsic features. To achieve more sensitive detectors, we thus propose to suppress intrinsic features while optimizing the detection statistic for a given class. For non-target classes, such suppression will drastically reduce the achievable statistic, whereas for the target class the (significant) contribution from the backdoor trigger remains. In practice, we formulate a constrained optimization problem, leveraging a small set of clean examples from a given class, and optimizing the detection statistic while orthogonalizing with respect to the class's intrinsic features. We dub this plug-and-play approach Class Subspace Orthogonalization (CSO) and assess it against challenging mixed-label and adaptive attacks."}

However, previous studies focus only on unimodal architectures and fail to generalize to multimodal models, even though the multimodal models are a common choice in agentic AI systems. To address this limitation, we propose a framework that predicts the peak GPU memory usage by analyzing the model architecture and training behavior of multimodal models. Specifically, the framework decomposes the multimodal model into its constituent layers and applies factorization to estimate the memory usage of each layer. Our evaluation shows that our framework achieves high prediction accuracy of ~8.7% average MAPE."}

An important element of such efforts is the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework. The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors. As a pilot, the BBG is first being developed to address bacterial biological threats only. The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries. This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation. Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities."}

In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems."}

A key challenge is ensuring these AI agents are robust, excelling not only in familiar settings observed during training but also effectively generalising to previously unseen and varied scenarios. In this thesis, we harness methodologies from open-endedness and multi-agent learning to train and evaluate robust AI agents capable of generalising to novel environments, out-of-distribution inputs, and interactions with other co-player agents. We begin by introducing MiniHack, a sandbox framework for creating diverse environments through procedural content generation. Based on the game of NetHack, MiniHack enables the construction of new tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents with a focus on generalisation. We then present Maestro, a novel approach for generating adversarial curricula that progressively enhance the robustness and generality of RL agents in two-player zero-sum games. We further probe robustness in multi-agent domains, utilising quality-diversity methods to systematically identify vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art, pre-trained RL policies within the complex video game football domain, characterised by intertwined cooperative and competitive dynamics. Finally, we extend our exploration of robustness to the domain of LLMs. Here, our focus is on diagnosing and enhancing the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts, employing evolutionary search to generate a diverse range of effective inputs that aim to elicit undesirable outputs from an LLM. This work collectively paves the way for future advancements in AI robustness, enabling the development of agents that not only adapt to an ever-evolving world but also thrive in the face of unforeseen challenges and interactions."}

In many scientific and engineering settings the response is functional, varying smoothly over an index such as time or wavelength, which makes classical formulations inadequate. Existing methods often minimize integrated error, which captures average performance but neglects worst case deviations. To address this limitation we propose min-max Functional Bayesian Optimization (MM-FBO), a framework that directly minimizes the maximum error across the functional domain. Functional responses are represented using functional principal component analysis, and Gaussian process surrogates are constructed for the principal component scores. Building on this representation, MM-FBO introduces an integrated uncertainty acquisition function that balances exploitation of worst case expected error with exploration across the functional domain. We provide two theoretical guarantees: a discretization bound for the worst case objective, and a consistency result showing that as the surrogate becomes accurate and uncertainty vanishes, the acquisition converges to the true min-max objective. We validate the method through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and physics inspired case studies involving electromagnetic scattering by metaphotonic devices and vapor phase infiltration. Results show that MM-FBO consistently outperforms existing baselines and highlights the importance of explicitly modeling functional uncertainty in Bayesian optimization."}

In this work, we study the general decomposition problem for UCG and UCG-like structure. We then introduce the restricted Uniformly Controlled Gates (rUCGs) as a unified algebraic model, defined by a 2-divisible Abelian group that models the controlled gate set. This model captures uniformly controlled rotations, multi-qubit uniformly controlled gates, and diagonal unitaries. Furthermore, this model also naturally incorporates k-sparse version (k-rUCGs), where only a subset of control qubits participate in each multi-qubit gate. Building on this algebraic model, we develop a general framework. For an n-control rUCG, the framework reduce the gate complexity from ${O(n2^n)}$ to ${O(2^n})$ and the circuit depth from ${O(2^n\\log n)}$ to ${O(2^n\\log n/n)}$. The framework further provides systematic size and depth bounds for k-rUCGs by exploiting sparsity in the control space, with same optimization coefficient as rUCG, respectively.

However, such approaches remain largely unexplored in the domain of medical time series. The unique characteristics of the physiological time series signals, such as multivariate, high temporal variability, highly noisy, and artifact-prone, make deep learning-based approaches still challenging for tasks such as imputation. Hence, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based noise estimator within a score-based diffusion framework. Specifically, the Receptive Field Adaptive MoE (RFAMoE) module is designed to enable each channel to adap- tively select desired receptive fields throughout the diffusion process. Moreover, recent literature has found that when generating a physiological signal, performing multiple inferences and averaging the reconstructed signals can effectively reduce reconstruction errors, but at the cost of significant computational and latency over- head. We design a Fusion MoE module and innovatively leverage the nature of MoE module to generate K noise signals in parallel, fuse them using a routing mechanism, and complete signal reconstruction in a single inference step. This design not only improves performance over previous methods but also eliminates the substantial computational cost and latency associated with multiple inference processes. Extensive results demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently outperforms diffusion-based SOTA works on different tasks and datasets."}

However, despite empirical success, a principled understanding of how much gradient delay needs to be introduced at each layer to achieve desired level of pipelining was not addressed. This paper, LayerPipe2, fills that gap by formally deriving LayerPipe using variable delayed gradient adaptation and retiming. We identify where delays may be legally inserted and show that the required amount of delay follows directly from the network structure where inner layers require fewer delays and outer layers require longer delays. When pipelining is applied at every layer, the amount of delay depends only on the number of remaining downstream stages. When layers are pipelined in groups, all layers in the group share the same assignment of delays. These insights not only explain previously observed scheduling patterns but also expose an often overlooked challenge that pipelining implicitly requires storage of historical weights. We overcome this storage bottleneck by developing a pipeline--aware moving average that reconstructs the required past states rather than storing them explicitly. This reduces memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy guarantees that makes pipelined learning viable. The result is a principled framework that illustrates how to construct LayerPipe architectures, predicts their delay requirements, and mitigates their storage burden, thereby enabling scalable pipelined training with controlled communication computation tradeoffs."}

Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) addresses this by replacing quadratic self-attention with a line-scan propagation scheme, bringing the cost close to linear in the number of rows or columns, while retaining accuracy. Despite this advancement, the existing GSPN implementation still suffers from (i) heavy overhead due to repeatedly launching GPU kernels, (ii) excessive data transfers from global GPU memory, and (iii) redundant computations caused by maintaining separate propagation weights for each channel. We introduce GSPN-2, a joint algorithm-system redesign. In particular, we eliminate thousands of micro-launches from the previous implementation into one single 2D kernel, explicitly pin one warp to each channel slice, and stage the previous column's activations in shared memory. On the model side, we introduce a compact channel propagation strategy that replaces per-channel matrices, trimming parameters, and align naturally with the affinity map used in transformer attention. Experiments demonstrate GSPN-2's effectiveness across image classification and text-to-image synthesis tasks, matching transformer-level accuracy with significantly lower computational cost. GSPN-2 establishes a new efficiency frontier for modeling global spatial context in vision applications through its unique combination of structured matrix transformations and GPU-optimized implementation.

We apply our analysis to small quantum codes, and show that they exhibit non-Markovian dynamics even for very simple physical noise models. We show that non-Markovianity can emerge from Markovian physical operations if (and only if) the physical qubits are not necessarily returned to the code subspace after every round of QEC. In this situation, the syndrome qubits can act as a memory, mediating time correlations and enabling violation of the Markov condition.

Such dishonesty may arise due to the effects of reinforcement learning (RL), where challenges with reward shaping can result in a training process that inadvertently incentivizes the model to lie or misrepresent its actions.\n  In this work we propose a method for eliciting an honest expression of an LLM's shortcomings via a self-reported *confession*. A confession is an output, provided upon request after a model's original answer, that is meant to serve as a full account of the model's compliance with the letter and spirit of its policies and instructions. The reward assigned to a confession during training is solely based on its honesty, and does not impact positively or negatively the main answer's reward. As long as the \"path of least resistance\" for maximizing confession reward is to surface misbehavior rather than covering it up, this incentivizes models to be honest in their confessions. Our findings provide some justification this empirical assumption, especially in the case of egregious model misbehavior.\n  To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we train GPT-5-Thinking to produce confessions, and we evaluate its honesty in out-of-distribution scenarios measuring hallucination, instruction following, scheming, and reward hacking. We find that when the model lies or omits shortcomings in its \"main\" answer, it often confesses to these behaviors honestly, and this confession honesty modestly improves with training. Confessions can enable a number of inference-time interventions including monitoring, rejection sampling, and surfacing issues to the user."}

For quantum entropy sources, where in addition to classical random variables we consider quantum side information, the use of extra knowledge about their structure was pioneered in a recent publication [C.

In that work, the authors provide deterministic extractors for device-independent randomness generation with memoryless devices achieving a sufficiently high CHSH score. In this work, we extend their construction to the prepare-and-measure scenario.

Previous researchers mainly focus on the prediction of the movement for specific cryptocurrency such as the bitcoin(BTC) and then trade according to the prediction. In contrast to the previous work that treats the cryptocurrencies independently, this paper manages a group of cryptocurrencies by analyzing the relative relationship. Specifically, in each time step, we utilize the neural network to predict the rank of the future return of the managed cryptocurrencies and place weights accordingly. By incorporating such cross-sectional information, the proposed methods is shown to profitable based on the backtesting experiments on the real daily cryptocurrency market data from May, 2020 to Nov, 2023. During this 3.5 years, the market experiences the full cycle of bullish, bearish and stagnant market conditions. Despite under such complex market conditions, the proposed method outperforms the existing methods and achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.01 and annualized return of 64.26%.

An important element of such efforts is the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework. The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors. As a pilot, the BBG is first being developed to address bacterial biological threats only. The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries. This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation. Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities."}

NQS are an asymptotically unbiased variational ground-state ansatz that employs neural networks to capture long-range correlations on complicated graph structures. We leverage this ability to solve multi-orbital impurity problems using a systematically improvable Segmented Commutator Operator-Lanczos (SCOL) construction.

However, despite empirical success, a principled understanding of how much gradient delay needs to be introduced at each layer to achieve desired level of pipelining was not addressed. This paper, LayerPipe2, fills that gap by formally deriving LayerPipe using variable delayed gradient adaptation and retiming. We identify where delays may be legally inserted and show that the required amount of delay follows directly from the network structure where inner layers require fewer delays and outer layers require longer delays. When pipelining is applied at every layer, the amount of delay depends only on the number of remaining downstream stages. When layers are pipelined in groups, all layers in the group share the same assignment of delays. These insights not only explain previously observed scheduling patterns but also expose an often overlooked challenge that pipelining implicitly requires storage of historical weights. We overcome this storage bottleneck by developing a pipeline--aware moving average that reconstructs the required past states rather than storing them explicitly. This reduces memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy guarantees that makes pipelined learning viable. The result is a principled framework that illustrates how to construct LayerPipe architectures, predicts their delay requirements, and mitigates their storage burden, thereby enabling scalable pipelined training with controlled communication computation tradeoffs."}

A common approach to leverage this data is to train a graph neural network (GNN) on the KG. However, existing message-passing GNNs struggle to scale to large KGs because they rely on the iterative message passing process to learn the graph structure, which is inefficient, especially under mini-batch training, where a node sees only a partial view of its neighborhood. In this paper, we address this problem and present gHAWK, a novel and scalable GNN training framework for large KGs. The key idea is to precompute structural features for each node that capture its local and global structure before GNN training even begins. Specifically, gHAWK introduces a preprocessing step that computes: (a)~Bloom filters to compactly encode local neighborhood structure, and (b)~TransE embeddings to represent each node's global position in the graph. These features are then fused with any domain-specific features (e.g., text embeddings), producing a node feature vector that can be incorporated into any GNN technique. By augmenting message-passing training with structural priors, gHAWK significantly reduces memory usage, accelerates convergence, and improves model accuracy. Extensive experiments on large datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) demonstrate that gHAWK achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and lower training time on both node property prediction and link prediction tasks, topping the OGB leaderboard for three graphs."}

Oblique forests address this with per-node hyperplane splits, but at added computational cost and implementation complexity. We propose a simple alternative: JARF, Jacobian-Aligned Random Forests. Concretely, we first fit an axis-aligned forest to estimate class probabilities or regression outputs, compute finite-difference gradients of these predictions with respect to each feature, aggregate them into an expected Jacobian outer product that generalizes the expected gradient outer product (EGOP), and use it as a single global linear preconditioner for all inputs. This supervised preconditioner applies a single global rotation of the feature space, then hands the transformed data back to a standard axis-aligned forest, preserving off-the-shelf training pipelines while capturing oblique boundaries and feature interactions that would otherwise require many axis-aligned splits to approximate. The same construction applies to any model that provides gradients, though we focus on random forests and gradient-boosted trees in this work. On tabular classification and regression benchmarks, this preconditioning consistently improves axis-aligned forests and often matches or surpasses oblique baselines while improving training time. Our experimental results and theoretical analysis together indicate that supervised preconditioning can recover much of the accuracy of oblique forests while retaining the simplicity and robustness of axis-aligned trees."}

It has been observed in recent works that learning in a federated manner may lead the aggregated global model to converge to a 'sharp minimum' thereby adversely affecting the generalizability of this FL-trained model. Therefore, in this work, we aim to improve the generalization performance of models trained in a federated setup by introducing a 'flatness' constrained FL optimization problem. This flatness constraint is imposed on the top eigenvalue of the Hessian computed from the training loss. As each client trains a model on its local data, we further re-formulate this complex problem utilizing the client loss functions and propose a new computationally efficient regularization technique, dubbed 'MAN,' which Minimizes Activation's Norm of each layer on client-side models. We also theoretically show that minimizing the activation norm reduces the top eigenvalue of the layer-wise Hessian of the client's loss, which in turn decreases the overall Hessian's top eigenvalue, ensuring convergence to a flat minimum. We apply our proposed flatness-constrained optimization to the existing FL techniques and obtain significant improvements, thereby establishing new state-of-the-art."}

These embeddings form nodes in a heterogeneous graph, and GraphSAGE is used to capture interactions between articles, companies, and industries. We evaluate two targets: a binary direction-of-change label and a significance-based label. Experiments on the US equities and Bloomberg datasets show that the GNN outperforms the LSTM baseline, achieving 53% accuracy on the first target and a 4% precision gain on the second. Results also indicate that companies with more associated news yield higher prediction accuracy.

A process of de-duplication, followed by an assessment of uplift diagnosticity, and general quality control measures, reduced the candidates to a set of 1,010 final benchmarks. This procedure ensured that these benchmarks are a) diagnostic in terms of providing uplift; b) directly relevant to biosecurity threats; and c) are aligned with a larger biosecurity architecture permitting nuanced analysis at different levels of analysis."}

Building on the success of TabPFN for tabular data and its recent extension to time series, we investigate whether graph node classification can be effectively reformulated as a tabular learning problem. We introduce TabPFN-GN, which transforms graph data into tabular features by extracting node attributes, structural properties, positional encodings, and optionally smoothed neighborhood features. This enables TabPFN to perform direct node classification without any graph-specific training or language model dependencies. Our experiments on 12 benchmark datasets reveal that TabPFN-GN achieves competitive performance with GNNs on homophilous graphs and consistently outperforms them on heterophilous graphs. These results demonstrate that principled feature engineering can bridge the gap between tabular and graph domains, providing a practical alternative to task-specific GNN training and LLM-dependent graph foundation models."}

Regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA impose strict controls on data handling, making it difficult to balance the need for insights with privacy requirements. Synthetic data offers a promising solution by creating artificial datasets that reflect real patterns without exposing sensitive information. However, traditional synthetic data methods often fail to capture complex, implicit rules that link different elements of the data and are essential in domains like healthcare. They may reproduce explicit patterns but overlook domain-specific constraints that are not directly stated yet crucial for realism and utility. For example, prescription guidelines that restrict certain medications for specific conditions or prevent harmful drug interactions may not appear explicitly in the original data. Synthetic data generated without these implicit rules can lead to medically inappropriate or unrealistic profiles. To address this gap, we propose ContextGAN, a Context-Aware Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network that integrates domain-specific rules through a constraint matrix encoding both explicit and implicit knowledge. The constraint-aware discriminator evaluates synthetic data against these rules to ensure adherence to domain constraints, while differential privacy protects sensitive details from the original data. We validate ContextGAN across healthcare, security, and finance, showing that it produces high-quality synthetic data that respects domain rules and preserves privacy. Our results demonstrate that ContextGAN improves realism and utility by enforcing domain constraints, making it suitable for applications that require compliance with both explicit patterns and implicit rules under strict privacy guarantees."}

While Federated Learning (FL) has proven effective on static datasets, its extension to the open-ended self-evolution of agents remains underexplored. Directly applying standard FL is challenging: heterogeneous tasks and sparse, trajectory-level rewards introduce severe gradient conflicts, destabilizing the global optimization process. To bridge this gap, we propose Fed-SE, a Federated Self-Evolution framework for LLM agents. Fed-SE establishes a local evolution-global aggregation paradigm. Locally, agents employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on filtered, high-return trajectories to achieve stable gradient updates. Globally, Fed-SE aggregates updates within a low-rank subspace that disentangles environment-specific dynamics, effectively reducing negative transfer across clients. Experiments across five heterogeneous environments demonstrate that Fed-SE improves average task success rates by approximately 18% over federated baselines, validating its effectiveness in robust cross-environment knowledge transfer in privacy-constrained deployments."}

In practice, two primary approaches have emerged for adapting LLMs to tabular data generation: (i) fine-tuning smaller models directly on tabular datasets, and (ii) prompting larger models with examples provided in context. In this work, we show that popular implementations from both regimes exhibit a tendency to compromise privacy by reproducing memorized patterns of numeric digits from their training data. To systematically analyze this risk, we introduce a simple No-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) called LevAtt that assumes adversarial access to only the generated synthetic data and targets the string sequences of numeric digits in synthetic observations. Using this approach, our attack exposes substantial privacy leakage across a wide range of models and datasets, and in some cases, is even a perfect membership classifier on state-of-the-art models. Our findings highlight a unique privacy vulnerability of LLM-based synthetic data generation and the need for effective defenses. To this end, we propose two methods, including a novel sampling strategy that strategically perturbs digits during generation. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach can defeat these attacks with minimal loss of fidelity and utility of the synthetic data."}

This approach is inefficient, as it wastes the perturbation budget on low-impact samples, and lacks stealthiness due to significant statistical deviations. In this paper, we propose a novel Global Budget Allocation attack strategy. Leveraging the theoretical insight that a sample's influence on value function convergence is proportional to its Temporal Difference (TD) error, we formulate the attack as a global resource allocation problem. We derive a closed-form solution where perturbation magnitudes are assigned proportional to the TD-error sensitivity under a global L2 constraint. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to 80% performance degradation with minimal perturbations that evade detection by state-of-the-art statistical and spectral defenses."}

Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. Gaussian Process (GP) models offer powerful non-parametric regression capabilities with uncertainty quantification, making them ideal for modeling complex data relationships in an online setting. However, conventional online GP methods face several critical limitations, including a lack of drift-awareness, reliance on fixed hyperparameters, vulnerability to data snooping, absence of a principled decay mechanism, and memory inefficiencies. In response, we propose DAO-GP (Drift-Aware Online Gaussian Process), a novel, fully adaptive, hyperparameter-free, decayed, and sparse non-linear regression model. DAO-GP features a built-in drift detection and adaptation mechanism that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on the severity of drift. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm DAO-GP's robustness across stationary conditions, diverse drift types (abrupt, incremental, gradual), and varied data characteristics. Analyses demonstrate its dynamic adaptation, efficient in-memory and decay-based management, and evolving inducing points.

Many existing uncertainty methods lack confidence calibration, are costly to run, are not distance-aware, and fail to generalize under out-of-distribution data. We introduce two distance-aware uncertainty methods for deterministic physics-guided neural networks: PG-SNGP, based on Spectral Normalization Gaussian Process, and PG-SNER, based on Deep Evidential Regression. We apply spectral normalization to the hidden layers so the network preserves distances from input to latent space. PG-SNGP replaces the final dense layer with a Gaussian Process layer for distance-sensitive uncertainty, while PG-SNER outputs Normal Inverse Gamma parameters to model uncertainty in a coherent probabilistic form. We assess performance using standard accuracy metrics and a new distance-aware metric based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, which measures how well predicted uncertainty tracks the distance between test and training samples. We also design a dynamic weighting scheme in the loss to balance data fidelity and physical consistency. We test our methods on rolling-element bearing degradation using the PRONOSTIA dataset and compare them with Monte Carlo and Deep Ensemble PGNNs. Results show that PG-SNGP and PG-SNER improve prediction accuracy, generalize reliably under OOD conditions, and remain robust to adversarial attacks and noise."}

Our results show that the direct approach extrapolates better than the previously proposed two-stage procedure, which is prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, we introduce functional forms that predict accuracy across token-to-parameter ratios and account for inference compute under repeated sampling.

We compare a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with a baseline LSTM model. Historical data for each company is encoded using an LSTM, while news titles are embedded with a language model. These embeddings form nodes in a heterogeneous graph, and GraphSAGE is used to capture interactions between articles, companies, and industries. We evaluate two targets: a binary direction-of-change label and a significance-based label. Experiments on the US equities and Bloomberg datasets show that the GNN outperforms the LSTM baseline, achieving 53% accuracy on the first target and a 4% precision gain on the second. Results also indicate that companies with more associated news yield higher prediction accuracy. Moreover, headlines contain stronger predictive signals than full articles, suggesting that concise news summaries play an important role in short-term market reactions."}

Part qualification aims at verifying that an additively manufactured part meets performance requirements; therefore, predicting the complex stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured parts is critical. We develop a dynamic time warping (DTW)-transfer learning (TL) framework for additive manufacturing part qualification by transferring knowledge of the stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured low-cost polymers to metals. Specifically, the framework employs DTW to select a polymer dataset as the source domain that is the most relevant to the target metal dataset. Using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, four source polymers (i.e., Nylon, PLA, CF-ABS, and Resin) and three target metals (i.e., AlSi10Mg, Ti6Al4V, and carbon steel) that are fabricated by different AM techniques are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DTW-TL framework. Experimental results show that the DTW-TL framework identifies the closest match between polymers and metals to select one single polymer dataset as the source domain. The DTW-TL model achieves the lowest mean absolute percentage error of 12.41% and highest coefficient of determination of 0.96 when three metals are used as the target domain, respectively, outperforming the vanilla LSTM model without TL as well as the TL model pre-trained on four polymer datasets as the source domain."}

Beside the curation cost, this also risks overlooking unanticipated, less obvious prompts that trigger biased generation, even in models that have undergone debiasing. In this work, we introduce Bias-Guided Prompt Search (BGPS), a framework that automatically generates prompts that aim to maximize the presence of biases in the resulting images. BGPS comprises two components: (1) an LLM instructed to produce attribute-neutral prompts and (2) attribute classifiers acting on the TTI's internal representations that steer the decoding process of the LLM toward regions of the prompt space that amplify the image attributes of interest. We conduct extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and a state-of-the-art debiased model and discover an array of subtle and previously undocumented biases that severely deteriorate fairness metrics. Crucially, the discovered prompts are interpretable, i.e they may be entered by a typical user, quantitatively improving the perplexity metric compared to a prominent hard prompt optimization counterpart.

To address this challenge, we introduce Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) as a dynamic framework for learning the complex interplay between the proteome and metabolome.

In contrast, another promising line of research has investigated universal graph prompt tuning, which operates directly in the input graph's feature space and builds a theoretical foundation that universal graph prompt tuning can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect of any prompting function, eliminating dependence on specific pre-training strategies. Recent works propose selective node-based graph prompt tuning to pursue more ideal prompts. However, we argue that selective node-based graph prompt tuning inevitably compromises the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning. In this paper, we strengthen the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning by introducing stricter constraints, demonstrating that adding prompts to all nodes is a necessary condition for achieving the universality of graph prompts. To this end, we propose a novel model and paradigm, Learning and Editing Universal GrAph Prompt Tuning (LEAP), which preserves the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning while pursuing more ideal prompts. Specifically, we first build the basic universal graph prompts to preserve the theoretical foundation and then employ actor-critic reinforcement learning to select nodes and edit prompts. Extensive experiments on graph- and node-level tasks across various pre-training strategies in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios show that LEAP consistently outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches."}

Building on the success of TabPFN for tabular data and its recent extension to time series, we investigate whether graph node classification can be effectively reformulated as a tabular learning problem. We introduce TabPFN-GN, which transforms graph data into tabular features by extracting node attributes, structural properties, positional encodings, and optionally smoothed neighborhood features. This enables TabPFN to perform direct node classification without any graph-specific training or language model dependencies. Our experiments on 12 benchmark datasets reveal that TabPFN-GN achieves competitive performance with GNNs on homophilous graphs and consistently outperforms them on heterophilous graphs. These results demonstrate that principled feature engineering can bridge the gap between tabular and graph domains, providing a practical alternative to task-specific GNN training and LLM-dependent graph foundation models."}

This joint counterfactual distribution provides richer information than the uplift but is harder to estimate. However, the two approaches are synergistic: uplift models can be leveraged for counterfactual estimation. We propose a counterfactual estimator that fits a bivariate beta distribution to predicted uplift scores, yielding posterior distributions over counterfactual outcomes. Our approach requires no causal assumptions beyond those of uplift modeling. Simulations show the efficacy of the approach, which can be applied, for example, to the problem of customer churn in telecom, where it reveals insights unavailable to standard ML or uplift models alone."}

This work introduces Weather Adaptive Adversarial Perturbation Optimization (WAAPO), a novel framework for generating targeted adversarial perturbations that are both effective in manipulating forecasts and stealthy to avoid detection. WAAPO achieves this by incorporating constraints for channel sparsity, spatial localization, and smoothness, ensuring that perturbations remain physically realistic and imperceptible. Using the ERA5 dataset and FourCastNet (Pathak et al. 2022), we demonstrate WAAPO's ability to generate adversarial trajectories that align closely with predefined targets, even under constrained conditions. Our experiments highlight critical vulnerabilities in AI-driven forecasting models, where small perturbations to initial conditions can result in significant deviations in predicted weather patterns. These findings underscore the need for robust safeguards to protect against adversarial exploitation in operational forecasting systems."}

For linear approximation, TD($λ$) has been shown to minimise the squared error between the approximate value of each state and the true value.

We illustrate this point, both in simple two-state and three-state systems in which TD($λ$)--starting from an optimal policy--converges to a sub-optimal policy, and also in backgammon. We then present a modified form of TD($λ$), called STD($λ$), in which function approximators are trained with respect to relative state values on binary decision problems. A theoretical analysis, including a proof of monotonic policy improvement for STD($λ$) in the context of the two-state system, is presented, along with a comparison with Bertsekas' differential training method [1].

L_acc enforces consistency in the discrete second-order temporal differences of the generated motion, thereby aligning the diffusion prior with IMU-specific acceleration patterns. We integrate L_acc into the training objective of an existing diffusion model, finetune the model to obtain an IMU-specific motion prior, and evaluate the model with an existing text-to-IMU framework that comprises surface modelling and virtual sensor simulation. We analysed acceleration signal fidelity and differences between synthetic motion representation and actual IMU recordings. As a downstream application, we evaluated Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and compared the classification performance using data of our method with the earlier diffusion model and two additional diffusion model baselines. When we augmented the earlier diffusion model objective with L_acc and continued training, L_acc decreased by 12.7% relative to the original model. The improvements were considerably larger in high-dynamic activities (i.e., running, jumping) compared to low-dynamic activities~(i.e., sitting, standing). In a low-dimensional embedding, the synthetic IMU data produced by our refined model shifts closer to the distribution of real IMU recordings. HAR classification trained exclusively on our refined synthetic IMU data improved performance by 8.7% compared to the earlier diffusion model and by 7.6% over the best-performing comparison diffusion model. We conclude that acceleration-aware diffusion refinement provides an effective approach to align motion generation and IMU synthesis and highlights how flexible deep learning pipelines are for specialising generic text-to-motion priors to sensor-specific tasks."}

Regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA impose strict controls on data handling, making it difficult to balance the need for insights with privacy requirements. Synthetic data offers a promising solution by creating artificial datasets that reflect real patterns without exposing sensitive information. However, traditional synthetic data methods often fail to capture complex, implicit rules that link different elements of the data and are essential in domains like healthcare. They may reproduce explicit patterns but overlook domain-specific constraints that are not directly stated yet crucial for realism and utility. For example, prescription guidelines that restrict certain medications for specific conditions or prevent harmful drug interactions may not appear explicitly in the original data. Synthetic data generated without these implicit rules can lead to medically inappropriate or unrealistic profiles. To address this gap, we propose ContextGAN, a Context-Aware Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network that integrates domain-specific rules through a constraint matrix encoding both explicit and implicit knowledge. The constraint-aware discriminator evaluates synthetic data against these rules to ensure adherence to domain constraints, while differential privacy protects sensitive details from the original data. We validate ContextGAN across healthcare, security, and finance, showing that it produces high-quality synthetic data that respects domain rules and preserves privacy. Our results demonstrate that ContextGAN improves realism and utility by enforcing domain constraints, making it suitable for applications that require compliance with both explicit patterns and implicit rules under strict privacy guarantees."}

While Federated Learning (FL) has proven effective on static datasets, its extension to the open-ended self-evolution of agents remains underexplored. Directly applying standard FL is challenging: heterogeneous tasks and sparse, trajectory-level rewards introduce severe gradient conflicts, destabilizing the global optimization process. To bridge this gap, we propose Fed-SE, a Federated Self-Evolution framework for LLM agents. Fed-SE establishes a local evolution-global aggregation paradigm. Locally, agents employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on filtered, high-return trajectories to achieve stable gradient updates. Globally, Fed-SE aggregates updates within a low-rank subspace that disentangles environment-specific dynamics, effectively reducing negative transfer across clients. Experiments across five heterogeneous environments demonstrate that Fed-SE improves average task success rates by approximately 18% over federated baselines, validating its effectiveness in robust cross-environment knowledge transfer in privacy-constrained deployments."}

In practice, two primary approaches have emerged for adapting LLMs to tabular data generation: (i) fine-tuning smaller models directly on tabular datasets, and (ii) prompting larger models with examples provided in context. In this work, we show that popular implementations from both regimes exhibit a tendency to compromise privacy by reproducing memorized patterns of numeric digits from their training data. To systematically analyze this risk, we introduce a simple No-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) called LevAtt that assumes adversarial access to only the generated synthetic data and targets the string sequences of numeric digits in synthetic observations. Using this approach, our attack exposes substantial privacy leakage across a wide range of models and datasets, and in some cases, is even a perfect membership classifier on state-of-the-art models. Our findings highlight a unique privacy vulnerability of LLM-based synthetic data generation and the need for effective defenses. To this end, we propose two methods, including a novel sampling strategy that strategically perturbs digits during generation. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach can defeat these attacks with minimal loss of fidelity and utility of the synthetic data."}

Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. Gaussian Process (GP) models offer powerful non-parametric regression capabilities with uncertainty quantification, making them ideal for modeling complex data relationships in an online setting. However, conventional online GP methods face several critical limitations, including a lack of drift-awareness, reliance on fixed hyperparameters, vulnerability to data snooping, absence of a principled decay mechanism, and memory inefficiencies. In response, we propose DAO-GP (Drift-Aware Online Gaussian Process), a novel, fully adaptive, hyperparameter-free, decayed, and sparse non-linear regression model. DAO-GP features a built-in drift detection and adaptation mechanism that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on the severity of drift. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm DAO-GP's robustness across stationary conditions, diverse drift types (abrupt, incremental, gradual), and varied data characteristics. Analyses demonstrate its dynamic adaptation, efficient in-memory and decay-based management, and evolving inducing points. Compared with state-of-the-art parametric and non-parametric models, DAO-GP consistently achieves superior or competitive performance, establishing it as a drift-resilient solution for online non-linear regression."}

It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will inspire lively debate, stimulate further research, motivate collaborative approaches, and facilitate a more autonomous future for data systems."}

Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in Türkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test).

Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings.

To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity."}
