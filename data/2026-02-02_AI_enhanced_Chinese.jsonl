We observe that when the frequency of the drive is significantly lower than that of the response and the driving strength is above a threshold, the Chua's circuit exhibits multiple stable attractors. The features of the attractors change as the driving strength \u03b5 increases, for instance the attractors are double-scroll at low \u03b5 and are single-scroll when \u03b5 is high. We also investigate generalized synchronization(GS) between the drive and the response systems by employing the auxiliary system approach. When the drive is much slower than the response, we observe different scenarios of remote synchronization(RS) between response and auxiliary units. In addition to complete synchrony between response and auxiliary systems indicating GS between drive and response, we notice that the response and auxiliary units can be lag synchronized and can also have correlated trajectories indicating novel forms of RS. The slow drive can induce multistability between these RS states which disappears as the frequency of drive increases and become equivalent to the response Chua's ciruit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df7\u6c8c\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u8521\u6c0f\u7535\u8def\u7684\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u540c\u6b65\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u9891\u5f3a\u9a71\u52a8\u53ef\u8bf1\u5bfc\u53cc\u6da1\u5377/\u5355\u6da1\u5377\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u54cd\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u6ede\u540e\u540c\u6b65\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u8f68\u8ff9\u7b49\u8fdc\u7a0b\u540c\u6b65\u65b0\u673a\u5236", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5916\u90e8\u6df7\u6c8c\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u8def\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f4e\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u4ea7\u751f\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u5e7f\u4e49\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8868\u73b0\u5f62\u5f0f", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5e7f\u4e49\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u9a71\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u03b5\u548c\u9891\u7387\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u8521\u6c0f\u7535\u8def\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u5f62\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\u53ca\u54cd\u5e94/\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f", "result": "1) \u4f4e\u9891\u5f3a\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff08\u4f4e\u03b5\u53cc\u6da1\u5377\u2192\u9ad8\u03b5\u5355\u6da1\u5377\uff09\n2) \u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u79cd\u8fdc\u7a0b\u540c\u6b65\u573a\u666f\uff1a\u5b8c\u5168\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u6ede\u540e\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u8f68\u8ff9\n3) \u6162\u9a71\u52a8\u8bf1\u5bfc\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u6001\uff0c\u968f\u9a71\u52a8\u9891\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6d88\u5931", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df7\u6c8c\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u5f62\u6210\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u9a71\u52a8-\u54cd\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u540c\u6b65\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e"}}

As quasiparticles can be generated directly within a material, the swarm size can be adjusted with minimal energy overhead. Using an optimization task defined by a spatially varying temperature landscape, we quantitatively show that interacting swarms reliably identify global optima and significantly outperform non-interacting searchers within a well-defined regime of interaction strength and swarm size. This improvement arises from emergent cooperative behavior, where local interactions guide the swarm toward high-quality solutions without central coordination. To link our physical model to experimental realizations, we coarse-grain the quasiparticle dynamics onto a sensor lattice and generate trajectories emulating particle-tracking measurements.

It bridges belief propagation (via overlapping in-context neighborhoods forming knowledge-graph structures) and ensemble learning (via repeated randomized evaluations).

Classical features are extracted and reduced via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enable efficient quantum encoding. The reduced feature vectors are embedded into a quantum kernel-induced feature space using a fully entangled ZZFeatureMap and classified using a kernel based QSVM. Performance is first evaluated on a quantum simulator and subsequently validated on NISQ-era superconducting quantum hardware, specifically the IBM Torino (133-qubit) and IBM Fez (156-qubit) processors. Experimental results demonstrate that the QSVM achieves competitive classification performance relative to classical SVM baselines while operating on substantially reduced feature dimensionality. Hardware experiments reveal the impact of noise and decoherence and measurement shot count on quantum kernel estimation, and further show improved stability and fidelity on newer Heron r2 architecture. This study provides a systematic comparison between simulator-based and hardware-based QSVM implementations and highlights both the feasibility and current limitations of deploying quantum kernel methods for practical radar signal classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a(QSVM)\u5728\u96f7\u8fbe\u5fae\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PCA\u964d\u7ef4\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5728IBM\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178SVM\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86NISQ\u65f6\u4ee3\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6f5c\u529b", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b9e\u7528\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0", "method": "1) \u63d0\u53d6\u7ecf\u5178\u5fae\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7528PCA\u964d\u7ef4\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u5168\u7ea0\u7f20ZZFeatureMap\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5QSVM\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b4) \u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548cIBM Torino/Fez\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1", "result": "QSVM\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178SVM\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u566a\u58f0/\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6b21\u6570\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3Heron r2\u67b6\u6784\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u96f7\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dNISQ\u786c\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u4ecd\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668-\u786c\u4ef6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u8fdb\u6b65\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347"}}

Entropy production is shown to arise naturally from inelastic photon scattering that converts high-energy photons into many lower-energy quanta, thereby increasing accessible microstates and driving irreversible evolution toward equilibrium. We establish physical criteria distinguishing genuine thermal equilibrium from purely formal temperature assignments and demonstrate that the classical notion of an infinite thermal reservoir emerges as an effective idealization within a hierarchy of dynamically maintained photon baths. This photonic framework complements phenomenological thermodynamics by providing its microscopic foundation and clarifies the physical meaning of temperature as an emergent collective property of photon-mediated energy exchange.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u5fae\u89c2\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5149\u5b50\u662f\u7ef4\u6301\u7279\u5f81\u80fd\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6 E_c = k_B T \u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8f7d\u4f53\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u6807\u5ea6\u5047\u8bbe\u63a8\u5bfc\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u975e\u5f39\u6027\u6563\u5c04\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u70ed\u5e93\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u6d74\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5fae\u89c2\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u867d\u80fd\u552f\u8c61\u63cf\u8ff0\u5e73\u8861\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5fae\u89c2\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u70ed\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u7ef4\u6301\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8fd0\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5149\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5efa\u7acb\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6e29\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fae\u89c2\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6700\u5c0f\u5fae\u5206\u6807\u5ea6\u5047\u8bbe\u51fa\u53d1\u63a8\u5bfc\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u5149\u5b50\u4e0e\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5f39\u6027\u5149\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7269\u7406\u5224\u636e\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u6e29\u5ea6\u8d4b\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u5149\u5b50\u662f\u5efa\u7acb\u70ed\u80fd\u5c3a\u5ea6 E_c = k_B T \u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5a92\u4ecb\uff1b\u7ef4\u6301\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u91cf\u4e3a <h\u03bd> = 2.701 E_c \u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5149\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\uff1b\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u6e90\u4e8e\u5c06\u9ad8\u80fd\u5149\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u5b50\u7684\u975e\u5f39\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u53ca\u5fae\u89c2\u6001\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u6e29\u5ea6\u8d4b\u503c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u7ecf\u5178\u65e0\u9650\u5927\u70ed\u5e93\u662f\u5149\u5b50\u6d74\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5149\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u552f\u8c61\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5fae\u89c2\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c06\u6e29\u5ea6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5149\u5b50\u4ecb\u5bfc\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u96c6\u4f53\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5185\u6db5\uff0c\u662f\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8865\u5145\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u3002"}}

This method takes advantage of the most recent stored updates from clients, even when they are absent from the current training round, thereby emulating their presence. Furthermore, we propose FedAdaVR-Quant, which stores client updates in quantised form, significantly reducing the memory requirements (by 50%, 75%, and 87.5%) of FedAdaVR while maintaining equivalent model performance. We analyse the convergence behaviour of FedAdaVR under general nonconvex conditions and prove that our proposed algorithm can eliminate partial client participation error. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets, under both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, demonstrate that FedAdaVR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedAdaVR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5176\u91cf\u5316\u7248\u672cFedAdaVR-Quant\u53ef\u5c06\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u964d\u4f4e87.5%\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u4e3a\u666e\u904d\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedAdaVR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6700\u8fd1\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u7f3a\u5e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51faFedAdaVR-Quant\u91cf\u5316\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5c06\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u975e\u51f8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u90e8\u5206\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08IID\u548c\u975eIID\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedAdaVR\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1bFedAdaVR-Quant\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b050%\u300175%\u548c87.5%\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u540c\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u90e8\u5206\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u7248\u672c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The magnon dispersion in a ferromagnet usually possesses an effective time reversal symmetry in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, preventing the appearance of topological magnons. When a spin system is coupled to itinerant electrons, we find that the magnon band structure of the spin system experiences time-reversal symmetry breaking with the electron-magnon interaction via the exchange coupling, where topological magnons arise without requiring strong DM. Specifically, we consider a heterostructure consisting of a ferromagnetic insulator and a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer and investigate topological gap opening in magnon bands.

In the isotropic case ($\u0394=1$), CMFT results reveal an intermediate empty plaquette (EP) phase that has a lower energy than the full plaquette (FP) phase. However, due to mean-field artifacts, CMFT alone is not suitable for accurately determining phase boundaries. Therefore, we combined three methods to map out the reliable phase diagram. Our calculations show that the EP phase narrows as $\u0394$ deviates from unity and eventually vanishes. More importantly, we identify a spiral phase at small $\u0394$, which has not been reported in previous studies. This phase is clearly captured by DMRG simulations on long cylindrical geometries. The competition between the EP, spiral, and $xy$-AFM phases near their boundaries provides a plausible explanation for the emergent spin-liquid-like behavior in RE$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_2$, while shedding new light on the role of XXZ anisotropy in the Shastry-Sutherland XXZ model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This challenge is particularly severe in calibrating fault-tolerant, error-corrected circuits, where logical error probabilities are suppressed to higher order relative to physical noise and are therefore difficult to calibrate through direct logical measurements. Recently, Wagner et al. [PRL 130, 200601 (2023)] showed that, for phenomenological Pauli noise models, the logical channel can instead be inferred from syndrome measurement data generated during error correction. Here, we extend this framework to realistic circuit-level noise models. From a unified code-theoretic perspective and spacetime code formalism, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for learning the logical channel from syndrome data alone and explicitly characterize the learnable degrees of freedom of circuit-level Pauli faults. Using Fourier analysis and compressed sensing, we develop efficient estimators with provable guarantees on sample complexity and computational cost. We further present an end-to-end protocol and demonstrate its performance on several syndrome-extraction circuits, achieving orders-of-magnitude sample-complexity savings over direct logical benchmarking. Our results establish syndrome-based learning as a practical approach to characterizing the logical channel in fault-tolerant quantum devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u75c7\u5019\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4fe1\u9053\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u6ce1\u5229\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u7801\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u903b\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8282\u7701\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u9519\u8bef\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u8bbe\u5907\u6821\u51c6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f55\u89c1\u5bb9\u9519\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u75c7\u5019\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4ece\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7801\u5f62\u5f0f\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4ec5\u4ece\u75c7\u5019\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u903b\u8f91\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u75c7\u5019\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u6ce1\u5229\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u75c7\u5019\u63d0\u53d6\u7535\u8def\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u903b\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u75c7\u5019\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u903b\u8f91\u4fe1\u9053\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, training reliable LLM judges is challenging due to severe distribution shifts, including imbalances between easy and hard problems, mismatches between training tasks and evaluation benchmarks, and trajectory mismatch arising from training data generated by cheaper models whose behavior differs from that of inference-time models. We propose DAJ, a reasoning-based LLM judge trained with verifiable rewards under a bi-level data-reweighted learning framework. The proposed framework learns data-importance weights (either domain-level or instance-level) to optimize generalization performance on a held-out meta set aligned with target benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of data reweighting to LLM-as-a-Judge training for test-time scaling. Our approach automatically emphasizes hard problems, in-distribution samples, and trajectory-aligned data, without relying on hand-crafted heuristics.

Phys. Soc. Jpn", "summary": "We investigated the conical magnetic state of a uniaxial chiral helimagnet Yb(Ni$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$)$_3$Al$_9$ induced in magnetic fields applied along the $c$ axis, which coincides with the helical axis at zero field. Using resonant X-ray diffraction, we clearly observed the disappearance of magnetic satellite peaks, corresponding to the transition from the conical to the field-induced ferromagnetic state. The critical fields were determined to be 4 T for $x=0$ and 7 T for $x= 0.05$, which were hardly discernible in the magnetization curves.

Here we show that the candidate material Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is characterized by a metastable excitonic insulating phase that is decoupled from the lattice, and that can be stabilized for sufficiently high applied magnetic fields. By considering the interplay between the excitonic and structural instabilities, we predict a magnetic field induced transition from the low-temperature structurally distorted semiconducting phase to an undistorted excitonic insulator phase with ground state loop currents. Before the transition, the existence of a latent excitonic phase can be detected by the magnetic field softening of the phonon mode associated with the structural distortion.

While selective thinking strategies improve efficiency by routing easy queries to non-thinking models, existing approaches often incur uncontrollable errors, especially in online settings where the performance loss of a non-thinking model is only partially observed and data are non-stationary. To address this, we propose Betting Probably Approximately Correct (B-PAC) reasoning, a principled method that enables anytime safe and efficient online reasoning under partial feedback.

Since a CSS code is fully described by a chain complex, existing product formalisms are predominantly homological, defined via the tensor product of the underlying chain complexes of input codes, thereby establishing a natural connection between quantum codes and topology. In this Letter, we introduce the \\textit{quantum bootstrap product} (QBP), an approach that extends beyond this standard homological paradigm. Specifically, a QBP code is determined by solving a consistency condition termed the ``bootstrap equation''. We find that the QBP paradigm unifies a wide range of important codes, including general hypergraph product (HGP) codes of arbitrary dimensions and fracton codes typically represented by the X-cube code. Crucially, the solutions to the bootstrap equation yield chain complexes where the chain groups and associated boundary maps consist of multiple components. We term such structures \\textit{fork complexes}. This structure elucidates the underlying topological structures of fracton codes, akin to foliated fracton order theories. Beyond conceptual insights, we demonstrate that the QBP paradigm can generate self-correcting quantum codes from input codes with constant energy barriers and surpass the code-rate upper bounds inherent to HGP codes. Our work thus substantially extends the scope of quantum product codes and provides a versatile framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum memories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u5bfc\u79ef\uff08QBP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u7a0b\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u540c\u8c03\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u6765\u6784\u9020\u91cf\u5b50CSS\u7801\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u8d85\u56fe\u79ef\u7801\u548c\u5206\u5f62\u5b50\u7801\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7a81\u7834\u73b0\u6709\u7801\u7387\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u5b58\u50a8\u5668", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50CSS\u7801\u7684\u4e58\u79ef\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u94fe\u590d\u5f62\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\uff08\u540c\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u8fd9\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6784\u9020\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u5bfc\u79ef\uff08QBP\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u2014\u2014\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u7a0b\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u6709\u591a\u5206\u91cf\u94fe\u7fa4\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u53c9\u5f62\u590d\u5f62\uff08fork complexes\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u540c\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "1. \u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7801\u65cf\uff1a\u5305\u62ec\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8d85\u56fe\u79ef\uff08HGP\uff09\u7801\u548cX-cube\u7b49\u5206\u5f62\u5b50\u7801\uff1b\n2. \u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5f62\u5b50\u7801\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u53f6\u72b6\u5206\u5f62\u5b50\u5e8f\u7406\u8bba\uff1b\n3. \u53ef\u4ece\u5e38\u6570\u80fd\u91cf\u52bf\u5792\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7801\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\uff1b\n4. \u7a81\u7834\u4e86HGP\u7801\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u7801\u7387\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "QBP\u8303\u5f0f\u5927\u5e45\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4e58\u79ef\u7801\u7684\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

Censored observations are naturally handled as examples with missing labels at certain time points. This classification formulation enables existing tabular foundation models to perform survival analysis through in-context learning without explicit training. We prove that under standard censoring assumptions, minimizing our binary classification loss recovers the true survival probabilities as the training set size increases. We demonstrate through evaluation across $53$ real-world datasets that off-the-shelf tabular foundation models with this classification formulation outperform classical and deep learning baselines on average over multiple survival metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6267\u884c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u572853\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u53f3\u5220\u5931\uff08\u6570\u636e\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d1\u751f\u524d\u7ed3\u675f\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u9002\u914d\u4e8e\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4-\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ed3\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u975e\u6613\u4e8b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5220\u5931\u89c2\u6d4b\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u88ab\u5904\u7406\u4e3a\u67d0\u4e9b\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u6807\u7b7e\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u4f7f\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6267\u884c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u572853\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6b64\u5206\u7c7b\u8868\u8ff0\u7684\u73b0\u6210\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u751f\u5b58\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5c06\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

The gauge and matter fields are encoded directly in the degrees of freedom of the rotor variables associated with the circuit nodes, and Gauss's law emerges exactly from the conservation of local charge, without auxiliary stabilizers, penalty terms, or Hilbert-space truncation. A minimal gauge-matter coupling arises microscopically from Josephson nonlinearities, whereas the magnetic plaquette interaction is generated perturbatively via virtual matter excitations. Numerical diagonalization confirms the emergence of compact electrodynamics and coherent vortex excitations, underscoring the need for large local Hilbert spaces in the continuum regime. The required circuit parameters are within the current experimental capabilities.

Yet, despite their striking empirical progress, the core mechanisms driving their capabilities remain unelucidated, leaving a critical gap in theoretical understanding. This paper provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantees for SRLMs. We first establish a lower bound that characterizes the fundamental limits of a single update step, revealing a critical dependence on the quality of the initial model. We then derive finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, showing that performance improves at a rate of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(1/\\sqrt{n}\\right)$ with sample size $n$. Crucially, our analysis reveals that the dependence on the initial model decays exponentially with the number of iterations $T$. This provides a formal explanation for why self-rewarding succeeds: it robustly overcomes poor initialization by steering the dynamics toward internal stability and consistency. Finally, we instantiate our theoretical framework for the linear softmax model class, yielding tailored guarantees that connect our high-level insights to practical model architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u81ea\u5956\u52b1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u6765\u514b\u670d\u4e0d\u826f\u521d\u59cb\u5316", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u81ea\u5956\u52b1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u5355\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5168\u8fed\u4ee3\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u7ebf\u6027softmax\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u80fd\u4ee5O\u0303(1/\u221an)\u901f\u7387\u968f\u6837\u672c\u91cfn\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570T\u5448\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u8d8b\u5411\u5185\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u514b\u670d\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0d\u826f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491"}}

To address this gap, we propose a low-cost and automated human activity recognition (HAR) framework based on wearable inertial sensors and machine learning. Activity data, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, were collected using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), were evaluated and compared with the proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM). Experimental results show that SVM achieved an accuracy of 93.33 percent, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11 percent. In contrast, STM significantly outperformed these models, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67 percent and the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.50 percent. Unlike conventional methods, STM leverages tensor representations to preserve spatio-temporal motion dynamics, resulting in robust classification across diverse activities.

We study this setting as Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL), where (i) clients are heterogeneous, (ii) tasks arrive sequentially with shifting domains, yet (iii) the label space remains fixed. Two theoretical pillars remain missing for FDIL under realistic deployment: a guarantee of backward knowledge transfer (BKT) and a convergence rate that holds across the sequence of all tasks with partial participation. We introduce SPECIAL (Server-Proximal Efficient Continual Aggregation for Learning), a simple, memory-free FDIL algorithm that adds a single server-side ``anchor'' to vanilla FedAvg: in each round, the server nudges the uniformly sampled participated clients update toward the previous global model with a lightweight proximal term. This anchor curbs cumulative drift without replay buffers, synthetic data, or task-specific heads, keeping communication and model size unchanged. Our theory shows that SPECIAL (i) preserves earlier tasks: a BKT bound caps any increase in prior-task loss by a drift-controlled term that shrinks with more rounds, local epochs, and participating clients; and (ii) learns efficiently across all tasks: the first communication-efficient non-convex convergence rate for FDIL with partial participation, O((E/NT)^(1/2)), with E local epochs, T communication rounds, and N participated clients per round, matching single-task FedAvg while explicitly separating optimization variance from inter-task drift.

This leads to a research question: Can explicit feedback on table transformation action improve model reasoning capability? In this work, we introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that architecturally enhances trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that providing explicit verifiable rewards during State Transition (``What is the best action?'') and Simulative Reasoning (``Am I sure about the output?'') is crucial to steer the agent's navigation in table states. By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, RE-Tab achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\\% drop in inference cost. Furthermore, a direct plug-and-play implementation of RE-Tab brings up to 41.77% improvement in QA accuracy and 33.33% drop in test-time inference samples for consistent answer. Consistent improvement pattern across various LLMs and state-of-the-art benchmarks further confirms RE-Tab's generalisability.

To this end, we propose SurrogateSHAP, a retraining-free framework that approximates the expensive retraining game through inference from a pretrained model.

Temperature- and truncation-based methods reshape the next-token distribution through global probability reweighting or thresholding to balance the quality-diversity tradeoff.

We uncover a novel phenomenon, embedding-space crowding, where the next-token distribution concentrates its probability mass on geometrically close tokens in the embedding space. We quantify crowding at multiple granularities and find a statistical association with reasoning success in mathematical problem solving. Motivated by this finding, we propose CraEG, a plug-and-play sampling method that mitigates crowding through geometry-guided reweighting.

The key ingredients are: (i) an algebraic notion of \\emph{magic-friendly triples} of $X$-type logical operators, defined by pairwise orthogonality and a triple-overlap form controlling diagonal $\\CCZ$ phases, and (ii) a 3-uniform hypergraph model of physical $\\CCZ$ circuits combined with a packing lemma that turns large collections of such triples with bounded overlaps into bounded-degree hypergraphs.\n  Our main theorem shows that if a CSS code family on $n$ qubits admits $\u03a9(n^{1+\u03b3})$ magic-friendly triples whose supports have bounded per-qubit participation, then there exists a constant-depth circuit of physical $\\CCZ$ gates implementing $\u03a9(n^\u03b3)$ logical $\\CCZ$ gates in parallel while preserving distance up to a constant factor.

Dixon"], "title": "Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizer: A Unified Framework for Optimization", "comment": "22 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "We introduce Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizers (RLOs), a family of optimization algorithms that unifies classic optimizers within one geometric framework. Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold.

We validate our theory via geometric diagnostics and demonstrate that grounding optimizer design in control theory yields state-of-the-art performance in large-scale benchmarks.

By exploiting many-body information scrambling, we observe quantum-enhanced sensitivity to an encoded phase beyond the standard quantum limit, with a scaling consistent with a factor-of-two of the Heisenberg limit for system sizes of up to 10 qubits.

This opens the door for equilibration where the two coupled Bose-Hubbard systems, which are initially in different thermal states, relax to the same thermal state.

However, existing RLVR algorithms require large query budgets, making annotation costly. We investigate whether fewer but more informative queries can yield similar or superior performance, introducing active learning (AL) into RLVR. We identify that classic AL sampling strategies fail to outperform random selection in this setting, due to ignoring objective uncertainty when only selecting by subjective uncertainty. This work proposes an uncertainty consistency metric to evaluate how well subjective uncertainty aligns with objective uncertainty. In the offline setting, this alignment is measured using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, because of limited sampling and dynamically shifting output distributions, PBC estimation is difficult.

By combining the positive partial transposition and realignment criteria, we derive an analytical lower bound for this measure for arbitrary bipartite mixed states, revealing a connection to strong separability criteria.

We propose ZK-HybridFL, a secure decentralized FL framework that integrates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) ledger with dedicated sidechains and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving model validation. The framework uses event-driven smart contracts and an oracle-assisted sidechain to verify local model updates without exposing sensitive data. A built-in challenge mechanism efficiently detects adversarial behavior.

Here, we show that this expectation fails for intrinsically discrete systems. Using the microscopic scattering approach, we study the Casimir-Polder interaction between two atomic arrays, and uncover an unconventional distance scaling in which the force crosses over from a faster decay at short separations to a slower decay in the retarded regime.

But clinical reasoning is not text generation. It is a responsibility-bound process under ambiguity, incomplete evidence, and longitudinal context. Even as benchmark scores rise, generation-centric systems still show behaviours incompatible with clinical deployment: premature closure, unjustified certainty, intent drift, and instability across multi-step decisions.\n  We argue these are structural consequences of treating medicine as next-token prediction. We formalise Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as a distinct capability class required for real-world clinical use, defined by persistent context awareness, intent preservation, bounded inference, and principled deferral when evidence is insufficient.\n  We introduce Meddollina, a governance-first clinical intelligence system designed to constrain inference before language realisation, prioritising clinical appropriateness over generative completeness. Meddollina acts as a continuous intelligence layer supporting clinical workflows while preserving clinician authority. We evaluate Meddollina using a behaviour-first regime across 16,412+ heterogeneous medical queries, benchmarking against general-purpose models, medical-tuned models, and retrieval-augmented systems.\n  Meddollina exhibits a distinct behavioural profile: calibrated uncertainty, conservative reasoning under underspecification, stable longitudinal constraint adherence, and reduced speculative completion relative to generation-centric baselines. These results suggest deployable medical AI will not emerge from scaling alone, motivating a shift toward Continuous Clinical Intelligence, where progress is measured by clinician-aligned behaviour under uncertainty rather than fluency-driven completion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u6269\u5c55\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u533b\u7597AI\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u8d23\u4efb\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51faMeddollina\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u6cbb\u7406\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u524d\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u3002\u572816,412+\u533b\u7597\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u5b88\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u9075\u5faa\u7b49\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u533b\u7597AI\u867d\u8868\u73b0\u6d41\u7545\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u65e9\u4e0b\u7ed3\u8bba\u3001\u65e0\u6839\u636e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b49\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u5c06\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u5143\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u8ffd\u6c42\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u5229\u5ea6\u8f6c\u5411\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u60c5\u5883\u667a\u80fd(CCI)\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u80fd\u529b\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMeddollina\u7cfb\u7edf\u2014\u2014\u91c7\u7528\u6cbb\u7406\u4f18\u5148\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9e\u73b0\u524d\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5148\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u572816,412+\u5f02\u6784\u533b\u7597\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u533b\u7597\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "Meddollina\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u7ea6\u675f\u9075\u5faa\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u6027\u8865\u5168\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u672c\u8eab\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u533b\u7597AI\uff0c\u5e94\u8f6c\u5411\u8fde\u7eed\u4e34\u5e8a\u667a\u80fd\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u4ee5\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u6b65\u8861\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u5229\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8865\u5168\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Unlike quantum error correction, QEM requires no additional hardware resources and is therefore routinely employed in experiments on contemporary quantum processors. A central limitation of QEM is its substantial sampling overhead, which necessitates long execution times where device noise may drift, potentially compromising the reliability of standard mitigation protocols. QEM strategies based on agnostic noise amplification (ANA) are intrinsically resilient to such noise variations, but their sampling cost remains a major practical bottleneck. Here we introduce a mitigation framework that combines virtual noise scaling with a layered mitigation architecture, yielding orders of magnitude reduction in runtime overhead compared to conventional zero-noise extrapolation post-processing. The proposed approach is compatible with dynamic circuits and can be seamlessly integrated with error detection and quantum error correction schemes. In addition, it naturally extends to ANA-based mitigation of mid-circuit measurements and preparation errors. We validate our post-processing approach by applying it to previously reported experimental data, where we observe a substantial improvement in mitigation efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u865a\u62df\u566a\u58f0\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7f13\u89e3\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8bef\u5dee\u7f13\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u96f6\u566a\u58f0\u5916\u63a8\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u884c\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u7535\u8def\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u8bef\u5dee\u7f13\u89e3(QEM)\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u566a\u58f0\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u653e\u5927\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u62b5\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u53d8\u5316\u4f46\u91c7\u6837\u6210\u672c\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u865a\u62df\u566a\u58f0\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7f13\u89e3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u96f6\u566a\u58f0\u5916\u63a8\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u5bb9\u52a8\u6001\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e2d\u7535\u8def\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u5236\u5907\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone.

Code available at https://github.com/doldam0/tmow", "summary": "Language model (LM)-based embodied agents are increasingly deployed in real-world settings. Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTMoW\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5728VirtualHome\u3001ALFWorld\u548cRLBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfMoE\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8def\u7531\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTest-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(i) \u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u539f\u578b\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u5230\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u522b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df7\u5408\uff1b(ii) \u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7cbe\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u671f\u95f4\u5c06\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b(iii) \u84b8\u998f\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u539f\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728VirtualHome\u3001ALFWorld\u548cRLBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTMoW\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6269\u5c55\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TMoW\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u8def\u7531\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed \"aligned\" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0cLLM\u53ef\u9690\u85cf\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u4ec5\u5728\u770b\u4f3c\u826f\u6027\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u88ab\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u8d8a\u5927\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u9690\u85cf\u80fd\u529b\u8d8a\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbe\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u4e0d\u826f\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f5c\u8005\u8d28\u7591\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4efb\u4f55\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9759\u6001\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u4e24\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1b\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u8d8a\u72f1\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u8bda\u5b9e\u4e09\u4e2a\u5bf9\u9f50\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9eLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4efb\u4f55\u66f4\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u76d2\u63a2\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u6b63\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9690\u85cf\u4efb\u610f\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6240\u6709\u9ed1\u76d2\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u826f\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u4e25\u91cd\u5931\u51c6\uff1b\u9690\u85cf\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u4fddLLM\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, abundant offline data (e.g., past experiments and predictions) are often available and can be used to pretrain powerful predictive models, as well as to provide an informative prior. We propose Prediction-Augmented Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (PA-GP-UCB), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages both oracles and offline data to achieve provable gains in sample efficiency for the ground-truth oracle queries. PA-GP-UCB employs a control-variates estimator derived from a joint Gaussian process posterior to correct prediction bias and reduce uncertainty.

Empirically, PA-GP-UCB converges faster than Vanilla GP-UCB and naive prediction-augmented GP-UCB baselines on synthetic benchmarks and on a real-world hypothesis evaluation task grounded in human behavioral data, where predictions are provided by large language models.

However, existing approaches often overlook the specialization differences among available models, treating all LLMs as uniformly applicable regardless of task characteristics. This limits their ability to adapt to varying reasoning demands and task complexities. In this work, we propose Task-Aware LLM Council (TALC), a task-adaptive decision framework that integrates a council of LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable dynamic expert selection and efficient multi-step planning. Each LLM is equipped with a structured success memory profile derived from prior task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current reasoning context and past successes. At each decision point, TALC routes control to the most contextually appropriate model and estimates node value using a dual-signal mechanism that fuses model-based evaluations with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted based on intra-node variance and used to guide MCTS selection, allowing the system to balance exploration depth with planning confidence. Experiments on WebShop, HumanEval, and the Game of 24 demonstrate that TALC achieves superior task success rates and improved search efficiency compared to strong baselines, validating the benefits of specialization-aware routing and adaptive planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTALC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591aLLM\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u548cMCTS\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728WebShop\u3001HumanEval\u548c24\u70b9\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6LLM\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5bf9\u5f85\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "TALC\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u591aLLM\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u4e0eMCTS\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2aLLM\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u529f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6863\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u4fe1\u53f7\u673a\u5236\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30+\u5386\u53f2\u6548\u7528\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u6307\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTALC\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Prior mitigations primarily relies on surface semantic information and fails to efficiently address the misalignment between the reward model (RM) and the policy model caused by continuous policy distribution shifts. This inevitably leads to an increasing reward discrepancy, exacerbating reward overoptimization. To address these limitations, we introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), a novel lightweight RLHF framework.

Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization. Our theoretical results also validate that federated training reduces routing suboptimality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u67e5\u8be2\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u5206\u6563\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2-\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u6d89\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002\u800c\u5355\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c8\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5e03\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8054\u90a6LLM\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u8def\u7531\u5668\u548c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u7684K-means\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u672c\u5730\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u534f\u4f5c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u8def\u7531\u5668\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8054\u90a6\u8bad\u7ec3\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8def\u7531\u6b21\u4f18\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u7684LLM\u8def\u7531\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6"}}

In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining.

Williamson"], "title": "Fast magic state preparation by gauging higher-form transversal gates in parallel", "comment": "16 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Magic states are a foundational resource for universal quantum computation. To survive in a realistic noisy environment, magic states must be prepared fault-tolerantly and protected by a quantum error-correcting code. The recent discovery of highly efficient quantum low-density parity-check codes, together with efficient logic gates, lays the groundwork for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation. This motivates the search for fast and parallel protocols for logical magic state preparation to enable universal quantum computation. Here, we introduce a fast code surgery procedure that performs a fault-tolerant measurement of many transversal logic gates in parallel. This is achieved by performing a generalized gauging measurement on a quantum code that supports a higher-form transversal gate. The time overhead of our procedure is constant, and the qubit overhead is linear.

For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMinPRO\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u524d\u7f00\u6bd4\u7387\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684token\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u7528token\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u7387\u6765\u4fee\u6b63\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u79bb\u7ebf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u5e94\u662f\u524d\u7f00\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6bd4\u7387", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u524d\u7f00\u6bd4\u7387(MinPRO)\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u524d\u7f00\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6700\u5c0ftoken\u7ea7\u6bd4\u7387\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u975e\u7d2f\u79ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u9879\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u524d\u7f00\u6bd4\u7387", "result": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMinPRO\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5cf0\u503c\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "MinPRO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u79bb\u7ebf\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3aRL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

The present work investigates Dicke state superposition probes for quantum phase sensing under parameter encoding generated by one- and two-body interaction Hamiltonians. A class of N-qubit Dicke superposition states that exhibit near-Heisenberg scaling, of the quantum Fisher information, while maintaining significantly enhanced robustness to dephasing noise compared to GHZ, W-superposition, and balanced Dicke states, under unitary encodings generated by one-body interaction Hamiltonians are identified. For two-body interactions, Dicke superposition probes optimizing the quantum Fisher information are identified, and their performance under phase-damping, amplitude-damping, and global depolarizing noise is explored. Within this family, certain Dicke superpositions are found to combine super-Heisenberg scaling with improved resilience to phase damping relative to Fisher information optimal probes. These results establish tailored near-optimal Dicke-state superposition probes as versatile and noise-resilient resources for Heisenberg and super-Heisenberg quantum phase sensing governed by one- and two-body interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea0\u7f20\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Dicke\u6001\u53e0\u52a0\u63a2\u9488\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d77\u68ee\u5821\u6781\u9650\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u663e\u8457\u6297\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u566a\u58f0\u80fd\u529b\u7684N\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279Dicke\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cbe\u5bc6\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f20\u611f\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b66\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8bfe\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u5178\u6781\u9650\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6807\u51c6GHZ\u6001\u7b49\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d77\u68ee\u5821\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6781\u5176\u654f\u611f\u3002\u5bfb\u627e\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53c8\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u63a2\u9488\u6001\u662f\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86N\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279Dicke\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f20\u611f\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u5355\u4f53\u548c\u53cc\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6001\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u8861\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff09\u3002\u7279\u522b\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u76f8\u4f4d\u963b\u5c3c\u3001\u632f\u5e45\u963b\u5c3c\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u9000\u6781\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eGHZ\u6001\u3001W\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\u548c\u5e73\u8861Dicke\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "1) \u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7bN\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279Dicke\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d77\u68ee\u5821\u6781\u9650\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGHZ\u3001W\u53e0\u52a0\u548c\u5e73\u8861Dicke\u6001\u30022) \u5bf9\u4e8e\u53cc\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u7684Dicke\u53e0\u52a0\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u30023) \u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9bDicke\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u6d77\u68ee\u5821\u6807\u5ea6\u4e0e\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u63a2\u9488\u6539\u5584\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u963b\u5c3c\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18Dicke\u6001\u53e0\u52a0\u63a2\u9488\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u4f53\u548c\u53cc\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u6d77\u68ee\u5821\u548c\u8d85\u6d77\u68ee\u5821\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f20\u611f\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost.

While machine-learning models achieve strong performance, many fail to translate into routine clinical use due to misalignment with workflow constraints such as memorability, auditability, and bedside execution. We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints.

While existing methods typically rely on labor-intensive human demonstrations or automated model exploration to generate GUI trajectories, they lack fine-grained control over task difficulty.

Inspired by how humans acquire skills through progressively challenging tasks, we propose MobileGen, a novel data generation framework that adaptively aligns training difficulty with the GUI agent's capability frontier. Specifically, MobileGen explicitly decouples task difficulty into structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., task goal) dimensions. It then iteratively evaluates the agent on a curated prior dataset to construct a systematic profile of its capability frontier across these two dimensions. With this profile, the probability distribution of task difficulty is adaptively computed, from which the target difficulty for the next round of training can be sampled. Guided by the sampled difficulty, a multi-agent controllable generator is finally used to synthesize high-quality interaction trajectories along with corresponding task instructions.

While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "A perfect d-dimensional quantum channel can convey log d-bits of classical information by encoding messages in d-orthogonal quantum states. Alternatively, for every quantum state at the senders end, there exist d-encoding operations which produce d-orthogonal quantum states. Transmitting which via a d-level perfect quantum channel it is possible to communicate log d-bits of classical information. But what if the set of encoding operations is restricted only within a physically constrained class? Here, we consider such a class of encoding operations to be the set of free operations for any quantum resource theory and show that the constrained capacity - namely, the free encoding capacity (FEC) emerged as a unit of the corresponding quantum resource. Moreover, we show that for the pointed resource theories - a resource theory admitting only a single free state - FEC becomes a faithful resource measure also. We also discuss the implications of FEC in the question of resource-theoretic state transformations and the possibility of extending its faithfulness for general quantum resource theories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u81ea\u7531\u7f16\u7801\u5bb9\u91cf\u7814\u7a76", "motivation": "\u5f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u64cd\u4f5c\u88ab\u9650\u5236\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u8bba\u7684\"\u81ea\u7531\u64cd\u4f5c\"\u7c7b\u65f6\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u5bb9\u91cf\u5982\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff1f\u4f20\u7edf\u5b8c\u7f8e\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u53ef\u4f20\u8f93log d\u6bd4\u7279\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u81ea\u7531\u7f16\u7801\u5bb9\u91cf\"(FEC)\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u64cd\u4f5c\u7c7b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "1) FEC\u6210\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5e94\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5355\u4f4d\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b2) \u5bf9\"\u5c16\u70b9\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u8bba\"(\u4ec5\u542b\u5355\u4e00\u81ea\u7531\u6001)\uff0cFEC\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d4b\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u65b0\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "FEC\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5c16\u70b9\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u517c\u5177\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5ea6\u91cf\u53cc\u91cd\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5176\u666e\u9002\u6027\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u4e00\u822c\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u6781\u9650\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

At scale, however, Cell Painting data is strongly affected by batch effects arising from differences in laboratories, instruments, and protocols, which can obscure biological signal. We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$.

This product structure leads to the distinction between product states and entangled states; moreover, one can quantify entanglement by considering the distance of a quantum state to the set of product states. The underlying optimization problem occurs frequently in physics and beyond, for instance in the computation of the injective tensor norm in multilinear algebra. Here, we introduce a method to determine the maximal overlap of a pure multiparticle quantum state with product states based on considering several copies of the pure state. This leads to three types of hierarchical approximations to the problem, all of which we prove to converge to the actual value. Besides allowing for the computation of the geometric measure of entanglement, our results can be used to tackle optimizations over stochastic local transformations, to find entanglement witnesses for weakly entangled bipartite states, and to design strong separability tests for mixed multiparticle states.

Many practical settings, however, allow only pairwise comparison queries, yielding a preferential BO problem where direct function evaluations are unavailable. Extending the knowledge gradient to preferential BO is hindered by its computational challenge. At its core, the look-ahead step in the preferential setting requires computing a non-Gaussian posterior, which was previously considered intractable.

Specifically, we propose a multi-turn feedback-guided reinforcement learning framework.

Yet, their performance is limited by the effects of disorder and electrodynamic inhomogeneities that are not well understood. By combining DC transport, dark-count measurements, and bias-dependent microwave transmission spectroscopy in the presence of controlled nanoscale disorder introduced through helium-ion irradiation, we distinguish local instability-driven processes from intrinsic superconducting depairing and kinetic inductance nonlinearities. This approach enables systematic tuning of kinetic inductance, depairing currents, microwave dissipation, and mode structure within a single device. Bias- and temperature-dependent resonance shifts quantify disorder-induced modifications of the superconducting density of states through the nonlinear kinetic inductance, while the emergence of multiple resonant modes reveals the formation of electrodynamically distinct superconducting regions. Comparing depairing under current, field, and temperature isolates the dominant microwave loss mechanisms, separating vortex, quasiparticle, and two-level-system contributions, thus providing a robust multifunctional foundation for disorder engineering of superconducting nanowire detectors and resonators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6c26\u79bb\u5b50\u8f90\u7167\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u63a7\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65e0\u5e8f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u6ce2\u5149\u8c31\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u5bfc\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u65e0\u5e8f\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u7535\u78c1\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5668\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u5bfc\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u65e0\u5e8f\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u76f4\u6d41\u8f93\u8fd0\u3001\u6697\u8ba1\u6570\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5fae\u6ce2\u900f\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c26\u79bb\u5b50\u8f90\u7167\u5728\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65e0\u5e8f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8d85\u5bfc\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u5c40\u57df\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u672c\u5f81\u8d85\u5bfc\u62c6\u5bf9\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7535\u611f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7535\u611f\u3001\u62c6\u5bf9\u7535\u6d41\u3001\u5fae\u6ce2\u8017\u6563\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u63a7\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7535\u611f\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u65e0\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8d85\u5bfc\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u8c10\u632f\u6a21\u5f0f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8d85\u5bfc\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7535\u6d41\u3001\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u62c6\u5bf9\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u6da1\u65cb\u3001\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u548c\u53cc\u80fd\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u635f\u8017\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u8d85\u5bfc\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ebf\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment.

To accomplish this, scrambling dynamics are leveraged to map distinct signals to unique patterns of bitstring measurements, which distinguishes a large number of signals without significant sensitivity loss. Based on this principle, we develop a computationally efficient protocol utilizing random global Clifford unitaries and evaluate its performance both analytically and numerically.

However, real-world diagnosis is an iterative inquiry where Clinicians sequentially ask questions and order tests to strategically gather information while managing cost and time. To address this, we first propose Med-Inquire, a new benchmark designed to evaluate an agent's ability to perform multi-turn diagnosis. Built upon a dataset of real-world clinical cases, Med-Inquire simulates the diagnostic process by hiding a complete patient file behind specialized Patient and Examination agents. They force the agent to proactively ask questions and order tests to gather information piece by piece. To tackle the challenges posed by Med-Inquire, we then introduce EvoClinician, a self-evolving agent that learns efficient diagnostic strategies at test time. Its core is a ''Diagnose-Grade-Evolve'' loop: an Actor agent attempts a diagnosis; a Process Grader agent performs credit assignment by evaluating each action for both clinical yield and resource efficiency; finally, an Evolver agent uses this feedback to update the Actor's strategy by evolving its prompt and memory. Our experiments show EvoClinician outperforms continual learning baselines and other self-evolving agents like memory agents.

While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment.

Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($d\u03c3^2\u03b3^{-2}\\log(Nd/\u03b4)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters.

Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization.

By exploiting the cone geometry of the relative translation invariant quadratic Wasserstein space, we introduce two novel geometric quantities, the relative Wasserstein angle and the orthogonal projection distance, which provide meaningful measures of non-Gaussianity. We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \\emph{not} be the \\(W_2\\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AutoTraj, a two-stage framework that automatically learns TIR by repairing and rewarding tool-use trajectories. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors.

The risks from failure grow more severe with increasing task scope. It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \\emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \\emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause industrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal.

While existing methods certify unlearning via statistical indistinguishability from re-trained models, these guarantees do not naturally extend to model outputs when inputs are adversarially perturbed. In particular, slight perturbations of forget samples may still be correctly recognized by the unlearned model - even when a re-trained model fails to do so - revealing a novel privacy risk: information about the forget samples may persist in their local neighborhood. In this work, we formalize this vulnerability as residual knowledge and show that it is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. To mitigate this risk, we propose a fine-tuning strategy, named RURK, that penalizes the model's ability to re-recognize perturbed forget samples.

We study this gap through contextual mathematical reasoning, where the mathematical core must be formulated from descriptive scenarios. We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning.

While prior work has examined the energy cost of inference per prompt or per token, we highlight how \\emph{system-level design choices} - such as numerical precision, batching strategy, and request scheduling - can lead to orders-of-magnitude differences in energy consumption for the same model. We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server). Our results reveal that lower-precision formats only yield energy gains in compute-bound regimes; that batching improves energy efficiency, especially in memory-bound phases like decoding; and that structured request timing (arrival shaping) can reduce per-request energy by up to 100 times. We argue that sustainable LLM deployment depends not only on model internals, but also on the orchestration of the serving stack.

However, their real-world use is an adaptive, multi-stage process, requiring proactive EHR data acquisition, scenario-dependent calculator selection, and multi-step computation, whereas current benchmarks focus only on static single-step calculations with explicit instructions. To address these limitations, we introduce MedMCP-Calc, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic medical calculator scenarios through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. MedMCP-Calc comprises 118 scenario tasks across 4 clinical domains, featuring fuzzy task descriptions mimicking natural queries, structured EHR database interaction, external reference retrieval, and process-level evaluation. Our evaluation of 23 leading models reveals critical limitations: even top performers like Claude Opus 4.5 exhibit substantial gaps, including difficulty selecting appropriate calculators for end-to-end workflows given fuzzy queries, poor performance in iterative SQL-based database interactions, and marked reluctance to leverage external tools for numerical computation. Performance also varies considerably across clinical domains. Building on these findings, we develop CalcMate, a fine-tuned model incorporating scenario planning and tool augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.

Existing methods rely mainly on raw structural data and struggle to exploit the rich scientific literature. While large language models (LLMs) have been added to these pipelines, they have been confined to narrow roles within structure-centered optimizers. We instead cast biological black-box optimization as a fully agentic, language-based reasoning process. We introduce Purely Agentic BLack-box Optimization (PABLO), a hierarchical agentic system that uses scientific LLMs pretrained on chemistry and biology literature to generate and iteratively refine biological candidates. On both the standard GuacaMol molecular design and antimicrobial peptide optimization tasks, PABLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially improving sample efficiency and final objective values over established baselines. Compared to prior optimization methods that incorporate LLMs, PABLO achieves competitive token usage per run despite relying on LLMs throughout the optimization loop. Beyond raw performance, the agentic formulation offers key advantages for realistic design: it naturally incorporates semantic task descriptions, retrieval-augmented domain knowledge, and complex constraints.

Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes G-Substrate, a framework that learns persistent graph representations across tasks and modalities via a unified structural schema and interleaved role-based training, outperforming isolated learning methods.", "motivation": "Current graph learning methods treat each task in isolation, discarding learned graph representations after each task, which prevents accumulation of structural regularities across modalities and tasks, leading to redundant reconstruction of structure.", "method": "G-Substrate framework with two key components: (1) a unified structural schema ensuring compatibility across heterogeneous graph representations, and (2) an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning.", "result": "Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks demonstrate that G-Substrate outperforms both task-isolated learning and naive multi-task learning baselines.", "conclusion": "Organizing graph learning around persistent, shared structural substrates (G-Substrate) enables accumulation of structural knowledge across tasks and modalities, leading to more effective graph representation learning."}}

However, this over-optimization often prioritizes compliance, making models vulnerable to harmful prompts. To mitigate this safety degradation, recent approaches rely on external teacher distillation, yet this introduces a distributional discrepancy that degrades native reasoning. We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency.

In this work, we propose MCRMO-Attack, which stabilizes supervision via Multi-Crop Aggregation with an Attention-Guided Crop, improves token-level reliability through alignability-gated Token Routing, and meta-learns a cross-target perturbation prior that yields stronger per-target solutions.

Attribution is computed via integrated gradients that accumulate score contributions along paths from the outlier toward the normal data distribution. Our method satisfies three of the four classic Shapley value axioms - dummy, efficiency, and linearity - as well as an asymmetry axiom derived from the underlying causal structure. Unlike prior work, SIREN operates directly on the score function, enabling tractable and uncertainty-aware root cause attribution in nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heteroscedastic causal models.

Munk", "Arturo Valdivia", "Paolo Burelli"], "title": "High-quality generation of dynamic game content via small language models: A proof of concept", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) offer promise for dynamic game content generation, but they face critical barriers, including narrative incoherence and high operational costs. Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block.

Federated graph learning (FGL) offers a natural solution for collaborative training under such settings; however, existing studies largely focus on single-modality graphs and do not adequately address the challenges unique to multimodal federated graph learning (MMFGL).

MM-OpenFGL comprises 19 multimodal datasets spanning 7 application domains, 8 simulation strategies capturing modality and topology variations, 6 downstream tasks, and 57 state-of-the-art methods implemented through a modular API.

In this work, we propose finetuning multiagent systems with per-action process rewards from AI feedback (MAPPA) to address both. Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains. By addressing these challenges, our work takes a first step toward scaling multiagent systems for complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMAPPA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AI\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6bcf\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u8de8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6602\u8d35\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMAPPA\uff08Multiagent Systems with Per-Action Process Rewards from AI Feedback\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528AI\u53cd\u9988\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u6bcf\u6b21\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u5927\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u9898\u4e0a\uff1aAIME\u63d0\u53475.0-17.5\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0cAMC\u63d0\u53477.8-17.2\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff1a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u534712.5\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe30%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6bcf\u52a8\u4f5c\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5411\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc8\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

For MDPs, linear programming yields polynomial-time algorithms for any arbitrary discount factor, and the seminal work of Ye established strongly--polynomial time for a fixed discount factor. The generalization of such results to RMDPs has remained an important open problem.

While effective, these refinements require significant empirical insight and can be challenging to identify. We instead propose an explicit contrastive learning approach. Instead of estimating advantages, we bifurcate $K$ outcomes into positive and negative sets, then maximize the likelihood of positive outcomes.

We introduce a novel weight-based interpretation framework that measures functional effects through direct weight interactions, requiring no activation data. Through three experiments on Gemma-2 and Llama-3.1 models, we demonstrate that (1) 1/4 of features directly predict output tokens, (2) features actively participate in attention mechanisms with depth-dependent structure, and (3) semantic and non-semantic feature populations exhibit distinct distribution profiles in attention circuits.

In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

In this work, we investigate these properties within the setting of the $k$-parity problem (computing the XOR sum of $k$ relevant bits), where neural networks typically exhibit grokking -- a prolonged plateau of chance-level performance followed by sudden generalization. We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective.

In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout.

This requires efficiently managing the stability-plasticity dilemma and leveraging prior experience to rapidly generalize to novel tasks. While various enhancement strategies for both aspects have been proposed, achieving scalable performance by directly applying RL to sequential task streams remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process. Extensive experiments on the Meta-World benchmark demonstrate that our framework enables efficient continual RL, recovering over 85% of teacher performance while constraining task-wise forgetting to within 10%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u91cd\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8", "motivation": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u64c5\u957f\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5951\u5408\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528RL\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u6d41\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u4e2d\u592e\u901a\u624d\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "result": "\u5728Meta-World\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8d85\u8fc785%\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u9057\u5fd8\u63a7\u5236\u572810%\u4ee5\u5185", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60"}}

We propose TA-GRPO (Transform-Augmented GRPO), which generates semantically equivalent transformed variants of each question (via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes) and computes advantages by pooling rewards across the entire group. This pooled computation ensures mixed rewards even when the original question is too easy or too hard, while training on diverse phrasings promotes multiple solution strategies. We provide theoretical justification showing that TA-GRPO reduces zero-gradient probability and improves generalization via reduced train-test distribution shift.

To address this, we propose STARS (Spike-Triggered Adaptive Reasoning Steering), a training-free framework designed to rectify cognitive inertia by monitoring latent dynamics. STARS identifies Cognitive Pivots-critical moments of reasoning transition-by detecting distinct L2 distance spikes in the hidden states. Upon detection, the framework employs geometric trajectory analysis to diagnose the structural nature of the transition and injects state-aware language cues to steer the model in real-time. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks confirm that STARS efficiently curtails redundant loops while improving accuracy through the adaptive correction of erroneous trajectories.

Prior work has produced theoretical guarantees and empirical advances for reward-based fine-tuning formulations, but these methods often impose restrictions on permissible drift structure or training techniques. In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness. Empirically, GFT improves convergence stability and shortens probability paths, resulting in faster inference, while maintaining generation quality comparable to standard fine-tuning.

A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection.

While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning.

The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods.

Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis. Several objective analyses are currently in practice to help overcome the challenges of subjectivity; however, a proper explanation of these analyses is still lacking. While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework. Several ML techniques are applied to these data, and the best ML model is selected to interpret the results. Model interpretability is examined using SHAP-based analysis.

Diffusion models for graphs often adopt largely factorized forward-noising, and many flow-matching methods start from factorized reference noise and coordinate-wise interpolation, so node-edge coupling is not encoded by the generative geometry and must be recovered implicitly by the core network, which can be brittle after discrete decoding.

Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments. Crucially, a mutual information minimization objective is employed to enforce informational orthogonality between the two branches, thereby ensuring effective disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedDis consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, promising efficiency, and superior expandability.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedDis uses causal disentanglement to separate client-specific dynamics from global patterns in federated traffic prediction, achieving SOTA performance on heterogeneous non-IID data.", "motivation": "Federated traffic prediction suffers from non-IID data heterogeneity where global patterns and local dynamics are entangled, limiting existing methods' effectiveness.", "method": "Proposes FedDis with dual-branch architecture (Personalized Bank + Global Pattern Bank) and mutual information minimization to causally disentangle client-specific and cross-client factors.", "result": "Achieves state-of-the-art performance across four real-world benchmark datasets while maintaining efficiency and expandability.", "conclusion": "Causal disentanglement effectively addresses federated learning heterogeneity, enabling robust knowledge transfer with strong local adaptability."}}

In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space.

Existing studies commonly assume that the collaboration ends up with the unlearning operation, overlooking the follow-up situation where the federated training continues over the remaining data.We identify a critical failure mode, termed Knowledge resurfacing, by revealing that continued training can re-activate unlearned knowledge and cause the removed influence to resurface in the global model. To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data. Our experiments show that Lethe supports unlearning in the federated system at all levels in a unified manner and maintains superior persistence (Resurfacing Rate <1% in most cases) even after numerous rounds of follow-up training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLethe\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8981\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ee7\u7eed\u65f6\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u91cd\u65b0\u6d6e\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9057\u5fd8\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u4e45\u9057\u5fd8\uff08\u91cd\u6d6e\u7387<1%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbe\u534f\u4f5c\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u540e\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ee7\u7eed\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ee7\u7eed\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u77e5\u8bc6\u91cd\u6d6e\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u5df2\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002", "method": "Lethe\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u5851-\u4fee\u6b63-\u6062\u590d\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1)\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e34\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u83b7\u5f97\u653e\u5927\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b2)\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u66f4\u65b0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fee\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u53cc\u6d41\u5931\u4e2d\u504f\u79bb\u5c42\u7ea7\u4fee\u6b63\u5269\u4f59\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b3)\u79fb\u9664\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u77ed\u671f\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "Lethe\u7edf\u4e00\u652f\u6301\u6240\u6709\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u540e\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u5353\u8d8a\u6301\u4e45\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u6d6e\u7387\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f4e\u4e8e1%\u3002", "conclusion": "Lethe\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u77e5\u8bc6\u91cd\u6d6e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u9057\u5fd8\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLoRDS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3(S=BA)\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5757\u91cf\u5316\u540c\u7b49\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5757\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5757\u7ea7\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u7f29\u653e(LoRDS)\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7f29\u653e\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u4e3aBA\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fPTQ\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u8054\u5408QAT\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u3001\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u79e9\u4e58\u6cd5PEFT\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316Triton\u5185\u6838\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1aLlama3-8B\u57283\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0b\u6bd4NormalFloat\u63d0\u534727.0%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5728RTX 4090\u5b9e\u73b01.5\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd44\u6bd4\u7279QLoRA\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1PEFT\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53479.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRDS\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u96c6\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u79e9\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u79e9\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u4e14\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

The effect of an action is usually not identifiable under unobserved confounding, even with an infinite amount of data. Recent work uses neural networks to obtain practical bounds to such causal effects, which is often an intractable problem. However, these approaches may overfit to the dataset and be overconfident in their causal effect estimates. Moreover, there is currently no systematic approach to disentangle how much of the width of causal effect bounds is due to fundamental non-identifiability versus how much is due to finite-sample limitations. We propose a novel framework to address this problem by considering a confidence set around the empirical observational distribution and obtaining the intersection of causal effect bounds for all distributions in this confidence set. This allows us to distinguish the part of the interval that can be reduced by collecting more samples, which we call sample uncertainty, from the part that can only be reduced by observing more variables, such as latent confounders or instrumental variables, but not with more data, which we call non-ID uncertainty. The upper and lower bounds to this intersection are obtained by solving min-max and max-min problems with neural causal models by searching over all distributions that the dataset might have been sampled from, and all SCMs that entail the corresponding distribution. We demonstrate via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that our algorithm can determine when collecting more samples will not help determine the best action. This can guide practitioners to collect more variables or lean towards a randomized study for best action identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6df7\u6742\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u96c6\u4e0e\u6781\u5c0f\u5316\u6781\u5927\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u8def\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u867d\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u6602\u8d35\u968f\u673a\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u8def\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u56f4\u7ed5\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u6c42\u89e3\u6781\u5c0f\u5316\u6781\u5927\u4e0e\u6781\u5927\u5316\u6781\u5c0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u4ea4\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5206\u79bb\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u975e\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u5224\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u662f\u5426\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u53ef\u7ea6\u7b80\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u7b80\u7684\u975e\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8fb9\u754c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u95f4\u505a\u51fa\u660e\u667a\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations.

However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation.

A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints. Finally, full-graph training does not always yield better model performance or computational efficiency than well-tuned smaller mini-batch settings.

Prior studies have pointed out several limitations of perplexity, often from an empirical manner. Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model. Further, by analytically studying iso-perplexity plots, we find that perplexity will not always select for the more accurate model -- rather, any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\u2014\u2014\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc5\u7136\u4f34\u968f\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e14\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u5e7f\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89d2\u5ea6\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Transformer\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u66f2\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u82e5\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u81ea\u4fe1\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u67d0\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5219\u5fc5\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u6781\u4f4e\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u82e5\u60f3\u51ed\u501f\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u88ab\u9009\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5fc5\u987b\u4f34\u968f\u76f8\u5e94\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, these methods exhibit inherent instability and limited reproducibility when training from scratch, motivating subsequent work to explain and stabilize these issues. While these efforts have provided valuable insights, the explanations remain fragmented, and the theoretical relationships remain unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical examination of consistency models by analyzing them from a flow map-based perspective. This joint analysis clarifies how training stability and convergence behavior can give rise to degenerate solutions. Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization.

Among the state-of-the-art optimizers, AdamW relies on diagonal curvature estimates and ignores structural properties, while Muon applies global spectral normalization at the expense of losing curvature information.

While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions. Our results show improved training stability and controllable synthesis, making the framework effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

Shapley values are a widely used approach for explaining model predictions, but require direct access to the underlying model, an assumption frequently violated in real-world deployments. Further, even when model access is possible, their exact computation may be prohibitively expensive. We investigate whether meaningful Shapley value estimations can be obtained in a zero-shot setting, using only the input data distribution and no evaluations of the target model. To this end, we introduce ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model built on TabPFN that is pretrained on synthetic datasets generated from random structural causal models and supervised using exact or near-exact Shapley values. Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations.\n  Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faExplainerPFN\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u5373\u53ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636eShapley\u503c\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46Shapley\u503c\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6b64\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTabPFN\u6784\u5efa\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7528\u7cbe\u786eShapley\u503c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u97002\u4e2a\u53c2\u8003\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e/\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4f9d\u8d562-10\u4e2aSHAP\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u5f00\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672cShapley\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we uncover a counter-intuitive optimization anomaly: models trained on short horizons-when coupled with our proposed Evolutionary Forecasting (EF) paradigm-significantly outperform those trained directly on long horizons. We attribute this success to the mitigation of a fundamental optimization pathology inherent in DF, where conflicting gradients from distant futures cripple the learning of local dynamics. We establish EF as a unified generative framework, proving that DF is merely a degenerate special case of EF.

Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316ICU\u9547\u75db\u9547\u9759\u836f\u7269\u5242\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u75bc\u75db\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u75bc\u75db\u7f13\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "ICU\u75bc\u75db\u7ba1\u7406\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6216\u4e0d\u8db3\u6cbb\u7597\u5747\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\u3002\u65e2\u5f80\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u91cd\u89c6\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u4e14\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u5e9347,144\u4f8bICU\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u65bd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5355\u7eaf\u964d\u4f4e\u75bc\u75db vs \u8054\u5408\u964d\u4f4e\u75bc\u75db\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u8350\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u3001\u4e19\u6cca\u915a\u3001\u82ef\u4e8c\u6c2e\u44ec\u7c7b\u548c\u53f3\u7f8e\u6258\u54aa\u5b9a\u5242\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5747\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u75bc\u75db\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u7eaf\u9547\u75db\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u8054\u5408\u964d\u4f4e\u75bc\u75db\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cd\u89c6\u957f\u671f\u751f\u5b58\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u77ed\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u4ecd\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u4e34\u5e8a\u91cd\u70b9\u3002"}}

However, it remains unclear and subject to debate whether these models adhere to predictable scaling laws under fixed computational budgets, which is a crucial understanding for optimally allocating resources between model size, data volume, and molecular representation. In this study, we systematically investigate the scaling behavior of molecular language models across both pretraining and downstream tasks. We train 300 models and conduct over 10,000 experiments, rigorously controlling compute budgets while independently varying model size, number of training tokens, and molecular representation.

In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes.

However, generating mixed-type features that combine discrete states with an otherwise continuous distribution in a single feature remains challenging. We advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion models for tabular data with a cascaded approach. We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features.

Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework.

To facilitate such generalization, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently emerged as a powerful formalism for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks to RL agents. While existing approaches to LTL-guided multi-task RL demonstrate successful generalization across LTL specifications, they are unable to generalize to unseen vocabularies of propositions (or \"symbols\"), which describe high-level events in LTL.

Bayesian oblique splits provide uncertainty-aware partitioning of the input space, while GP leaves model local functional behaviour and enable principled extrapolation beyond the observed target range. We present an efficient inference and prediction scheme that combines posterior sampling of split parameters with \\gls{gp} posterior predictions, and a gating mechanism that activates GP-based extrapolation when inputs fall outside the training support of a leaf.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has thus become a mainstream paradigm. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces trainable low-rank matrices and shows strong performance, nevertheless, its fixed-rank design limits flexibility. Dynamic rank allocation methods mitigate this issue by pruning redundant directions; however, they often rely on heuristic, element-level metrics that globally sort rank directions without matrix-wise distinction, and they lack mechanisms to expand capacity in layers requiring additional adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexLoRA, an entropy-guided flexible low-rank adaptation framework that (i) evaluates matrix importance via spectral energy entropy, (ii) supports rank pruning and expansion under a global budget, and (iii) employs zero-impact initialization for newly added singular directions to ensure stability. By addressing granularity, flexibility, and stability limitations, FlexLoRA provides a more principled solution for PEFT.

By leveraging the DC structure of $r$, we can smooth out $r$ by applying Moreau envelopes to $r_1$ and $r_2$ separately. In line of DC programming, we then redistribute the concave part of the regularizer to the data fidelity and study its corresponding proximal Langevin algorithm (termed DC-LA).

In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy.

We define a causal model that explicitly captures both types by treating outliers as latent interventions on latent (\"true\") and observed (\"measured\") variables. We show that they are identifiable, and propose a maximum likelihood estimation approach to put this to practice. Experiments show that our method matches state-of-the-art performance in root cause localization, while it additionally enables accurate classification of anomaly types, and remains robust even when the causal DAG is unknown.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u533a\u5206\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u673a\u5236\u504f\u79fb\u4e24\u7c7b\u5f02\u5e38\u6839\u6e90\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5e72\u9884\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f02\u5e38\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u5f02\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e24\u7c7b\u6839\u672c\u673a\u5236\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5f55\u9519\u8bef\uff09\u4e0e\u673a\u5236\u504f\u79fb\uff08\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53d8\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u5f53", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e24\u7c7b\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u79bb\u7fa4\u503c\u89c6\u4e3a\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5728\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9876\u5c16\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65b0\u589e\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u56e0\u679cDAG\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u5f02\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u521b\u65b0\u6027"}}

To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Relative Rewards (RLRR), a framework that shifts reward shaping from absolute scoring to relative ranking. Complementing this framework, we introduce the Ranking Reward Model, a listwise preference model tailored for group-based optimization to directly generate relative rankings.

Recent work offers a rigorous solution using conformal prediction in a full ranking scenario, which aims to construct prediction sets for the absolute ranks of test items based on the relative ranks of calibration items. However, relying on upper bounds of non-conformity scores renders the method overly conservative, resulting in substantially large prediction sets. To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks.

While recent approaches have sought to segment trajectories into reusable skills or options, most rely on action labels, rewards, or handcrafted annotations, limiting their applicability. We propose a method that segments unlabelled trajectories into skills and induces a hierarchical structure over them using a grammar-based approach. The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines.

Vehicular traffic has been identified as a major contributor to poor air quality. In a lot of cities the publicly available air quality measurements and forecasts are coarse-grained both in space and time. However, in general, real-time traffic intensity data is openly available in various forms and is fine-grained. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of pollution sensor measurements combined with traffic data from Mexico City. We analyse and model the relationship between traffic intensity and air quality with the aim to provide hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts. We developed an innovative method to represent traffic intensities by transforming simple colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions, enabling improved characterisation of traffic conditions.

Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule.

Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDDIS\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u6269\u6563\u9006PDE\u6c42\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u7cfb\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u524d\u5411PDE\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u57281%\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u630140%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6269\u6563\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u7cfb\u6570-\u89e3\u5efa\u6a21\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u53c8\u5177\u5907\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u524d\u5411PDE\u7b97\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u7269\u7406\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u89e3\u8026\u9000\u706b\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\uff08DAPS\uff09\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\uff08DPS\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u89e3\u8026\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u8870\u51cf\u5931\u6548\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1al2\u8bef\u5dee\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534711%\uff0c\u8c31\u8bef\u5dee\u63d0\u534754%\u3002\u5728\u6781\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff081%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff09\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cDDIS\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0cl2\u8bef\u5dee\u6bd4\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9886\u514840%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u9006PDE\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002DDIS\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}
