Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出在量子隐形传态中结合纠缠纯化与穿孔量子纠错码，通过自适应调整码率来适应纯化过程中变化的错误特性，从而提升可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典通信假设下，量子隐形传态的可靠性受共享EPR对保真度限制。联合使用纠缠纯化和量子纠错时，由于纯化会改变不完美EPR传态引入的错误结构，固定速率纠错码无法在所有纯化机制和可靠性目标下保持最优性能。

Method: 采用穿孔QEC码作为纯化补充，构建可适应错误信道特征与可靠性目标的码族变体，通过数值结果验证其在不同工作区间的性能优势。

Result: 数值结果表明，不同穿孔码在不同工作区间实现最低逻辑错误概率，选择最优穿孔码可显著降低逻辑错误率，相比固定速率编码具有明显改进。

Conclusion: 穿孔技术使系统能在不同纠缠条件下自适应调整，同时复用单一稳定子结构，放宽了实现目标可靠性对初始EPR保真度和纯化程度的要求。

Abstract: Quantum teleportation is a foundational protocol for sending quantum information through entanglement distribution and classical communication. Assuming ideal classical communication, the reliability of quantum teleportation is limited by the fidelity of the shared EPR pairs. This reliability can be improved through two mechanisms: entanglement purification and quantum error correction (QEC). Using both techniques in concert requires flexible QEC rates, since purification alters the structure of errors induced by imperfect-EPR teleportation, and fixed-rate codes cannot be uniformly effective across purification regimes or reliability targets. In this work, we supplement purification with punctured QEC codes, providing a family of code variants that can be adapted to error-channel characteristics and reliability targets. Punctured codes improve teleportation reliability across a broader range of purification regimes, enabling target reliability to be met without hardware-level code switching. This is corroborated by numerical results, showing that different punctured codes achieve the lowest logical error probability in different operating regimes, and that selecting among them reduces logical error relative to fixed-rate encoded teleportation. This reduction relaxes the requirement on the initial EPR fidelity or purification needed to achieve a target reliability. Overall, puncturing enables adaptation to varying entanglement conditions and reliability requirements while reusing a single stabilizer structure.

### [2] [Quantum metrology with partially accessible chaotic sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12914)
*Harshita Sharma,Sayan Choudhury,Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum chaotic sensors overcome limitations of entanglement and full measurement accessibility in quantum metrology, achieving Heisenberg-scale sensitivity even with only 5% of qubits accessible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world quantum sensors struggle with the stringent requirements of highly entangled probe states and globally accessible measurements needed to surpass the standard quantum limit.

Method: Analyzed quantum chaotic systems where initial unentangled states evolve under chaotic dynamics, quantifying sensitivity via time-dependent quantum Fisher information (Iα) under partial measurement constraints.

Result: In weak chaos, spin-coherent states at phase-space island edges maximize sensitivity; in strong chaos, Iα exhibits Heisenberg scaling regardless of initial state. Sensitivity remains quantum-enhanced even with only ~5% qubit accessibility.

Conclusion: Quantum chaos serves as a robust resource for practical quantum-enhanced sensing, relaxing the need for entanglement and full system access in many-body sensors.

Abstract: Most quantum metrology protocols harness highly entangled probe states and globally accessible measurements to surpass the standard quantum limit. However, it is challenging to satisfy these requirements in realistic many-body sensors. We demonstrate that both of these constraints can be overcome in quantum chaotic sensors. Crucially, we establish that even in the presence of partial measurement accessibility, chaotic dynamics enables initial unentangled states to exhibit Heisenberg scaling of the quantum Fisher information, $I_α$ with time. In the weakly chaotic regime, we identify spin-coherent states placed at the edge of the regular islands in the mixed classical phase space as optimal initial states for enhanced sensitivity. On the other hand, in the strongly chaotic regime, $I_α$ is insensitive to the choice of the initial state. Notably, quantum-enhanced sensitivity is achieved even when a very low fraction ($\sim 5\%$) of the qubits are accessible. These results establish quantum chaos as a robust resource for quantum-enhanced sensing under realistic accessibility constraints on accessibility.

Abstract: We present a quantum reservoir computing (QRC) framework based on a small-scale quantum system comprising at most six interacting qubits, designed for nonlinear financial time-series forecasting. We apply the model to predict future daily closing trading volumes of 20 quantum-sector publicly traded companies over the period from April 11, 2020, to April 11, 2025, as well as minute-by-minute trading volumes during out-of-market hours on July 7, 2025. Our analysis identifies optimal reservoir parameters that yield stock trend (up/down) classification accuracies exceeding $86 \%$. Importantly, the QRC model is platform-agnostic and can be realized across diverse physical implementations of qubits, including superconducting circuits and trapped ions. These results demonstrate the expressive power and robustness of small-scale quantum reservoirs for modeling complex temporal correlations in financial data, highlighting their potential applicability to real-world forecasting tasks on near-term quantum hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准概率在物理学多个领域出现，但其概念基础不明确：常被仅视为计算工具，且条件化和贝叶斯定理等操作存在歧义。

Method: 基于句法局部性原则（每个论域可嵌入更大论域且普遍估值需保持一致性），从结构原理出发证明表示定理，将可接受估值表示为互斥命题上的有限可加测度（预概率）。

Result: 1. 预概率可唯一规约为有限准概率（经典概率是其子类）；2. 建立了连贯的条件理论，得到适用于准概率的广义贝叶斯定理。

Conclusion: 准概率理论从计算工具转变为普遍赋值的唯一确定加法表示；经典概率是准概率中满足相对化稳定性的子类；该框架为条件推理提供了严格基础。

Abstract: Quasi-probabilities appear across diverse areas of physics, but their conceptual foundations remain unclear: they are often treated merely as computational tools, and operations like conditioning and Bayes' theorem become ambiguous. We address both issues by developing a principled framework that derives quasi-probabilities and their conditional calculus from structural consistency requirements on how statements are valued across different universes of discourse, understood as finite Boolean algebras of statements.We begin with a universal valuation that assigns definite (possibly complex) values to all statements. The central concept is Syntactic Locality: every universe can be embedded within a larger ambient one, and the universal valuation must behave coherently under such embeddings and restrictions. From a set of structural principles, we prove a representation theorem showing that every admissible valuation can be re-expressed as a finitely additive measure on mutually exclusive statements, mirroring the usual probability sum rule. We call such additive representatives pre-probabilities. This representation is unique up to an additive regraduation freedom. When this freedom can be fixed canonically, pre-probabilities reduce to finite quasi-probabilities, thereby elevating quasi-probability theory from a computational device to a uniquely determined additive representation of universal valuations. Classical finite probabilities arise as the subclass of quasi-probabilities stable under relativisation, i.e., closed under restriction to sub-universes. Finally, the same framework enables us to define a coherent theory of conditionals, yielding a well-defined generalized Bayes' theorem applicable to both pre-probabilities and quasi-probabilities. We conclude by discussing additional regularity conditions, including the role of rational versus irrational probabilities in this setting.

### [5] [Accelerating Feedback-based Algorithms for Quantum Optimization Using Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12387)
*Masih Mozakka,Mohsen Heidari*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid method combining per-layer gradient estimation with Quantum Lyapunov Control (QLC) to accelerate QAOA convergence while preserving low training overhead and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feedback-based QLC methods for QAOA training reduce overhead and mitigate barren plateaus but suffer from slow convergence due to long control sequences.

Method: Integrates layer-wise gradient estimation into QLC to select near-optimal control parameters per layer, enhancing convergence speed without sacrificing stability.

Result: Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate significantly faster convergence and improved robustness across diverse optimization problem instances.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully accelerates QLC convergence while maintaining its core advantages of low training overhead and monotonic objective improvement.

Abstract: Feedback-based methods have gained significant attention as an alternative training paradigm for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in solving combinatorial optimization problems such as MAX-CUT. In particular, Quantum Lyapunov Control (QLC) employs feedback-driven control laws that guarantee monotonic non-decreasing objective values, can substantially reduce the training overhead of QAOA, and mitigate barren plateaus. However, these methods might require long control sequences, leading to sub-optimal convergence rates. In this work, we propose a hybrid method that incorporates per-layer gradient estimation to accelerate the convergence of QLC while preserving its low training overhead and stability guarantees. By leveraging layer-wise gradient information, the proposed approach selects near-optimal control parameters, resulting in significantly faster convergence and improved robustness. We validate the effectiveness of the method through extensive numerical experiments across a range of problem instances and optimization settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ...

Method: ...

Result: ...

Conclusion: ...

Abstract: Distributed quantum protocols rely on classical feedforward information to process measurement outcomes, but heterogeneous hardware and uncertain local timing can make the causal order of measurements ambiguous when inferred solely from arrival times. Even in simple line networks with only Pauli measurements, end nodes cannot distinguish whether a missing outcome is caused by slow measurement or by delayed classical propagation. To resolve this ambiguity, we propose a time-division architecture for quantum networks in which nodes perform measurements in pre-assigned slots, ensuring a unique causal interpretation of outcomes. We formalize this temporal framework and derive the feedforward and adjacency constraints required to preserve measurement causality. For simple network topologies, we present an algorithm that yields optimal measurement schedules. Overall, the proposed time-division model provides a practical coordination layer that bridges the classical network timing with quantum measurement processing, enabling reliable and scalable measurement-based quantum networking.

### [7] [Challenge-Response Quantum Reinforcement Learning with Application to Quantum-Assisted Authentication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12464)
*Jawaher Kaldari,Saif Al-Kuwari*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a quantum challenge-response environment where a lightweight hybrid RL agent infers hidden bits from limited quantum states, outperforming classical and deep hybrid agents with just two quantum copies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QRL studies apply quantum agents to classical environments, failing to exploit the full potential of QRL. True advantages emerge in intrinsically quantum environments with quantum observations and interactions.

Method: Formulates a quantum challenge-response task where Alice encodes classical bits into quantum circuits, and Bob (RL agent) interacts with limited quantum state copies to infer the hidden bit. Tests three agents (classical, lightweight hybrid, deep hybrid) under explicit resource constraints and varying interaction penalties.

Result: Lightweight hybrid agent achieves reliable inference with as few as two quantum state copies, outperforming classical baseline and deep hybrid agent in highly resource-constrained regimes. Robustness validated under realistic quantum noise models.

Conclusion: The proposed environment demonstrates practical QRL advantages in resource efficiency and has relevance for security applications like quantum-assisted authentication.

Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising research direction that integrates quantum information processing into reinforcement learning frameworks. While many existing QRL studies apply quantum agents to classical environments, it has been realized that the potential advantages of QRL are most naturally explored in environments that exhibit intrinsically quantum characteristics, where the agent's observations and interactions arise from quantum processes. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning environment formulated as a challenge-response task with hidden information. In the proposed environment, Alice encodes a classical bit into the parameters of a quantum circuit, while Bob, with a trained reinforcement learning agent, interacts with a limited number of quantum state copies to infer the hidden bit. The agent must select measurement strategies and decide when to terminate the interaction under explicit resource constraints. To study the solvability of the proposed environment, we consider three agents: a purely classical agent, a lightweight hybrid agent and a deep hybrid agent. Through experiments, we analyze the trade-off between inference accuracy and quantum resource consumption under varying interaction penalties. Our results show that the lightweight hybrid agent achieves reliable inference using as few as two quantum state copies, outperforming both the classical baseline and the deep hybrid agent in highly resource-constrained regimes. We further evaluate robustness under realistic quantum noise models and discuss the relevance of the proposed environment for security-oriented applications, including quantum-assisted authentication.

Abstract: Within quantum machine learning, parametrized quantum circuits provide flexible quantum models, but their performance is often highly task-dependent, making manual circuit design challenging. Alternatively, quantum architecture search algorithms have been proposed to automate the discovery of task-specific parametrized quantum circuits using systematic frameworks. In this work, we propose an evolution-inspired heuristic quantum architecture search algorithm, which we refer to as the local quantum architecture search. The goal of the local quantum architecture search algorithm is to optimize parametrized quantum circuit architectures through a local, probabilistic search over a fixed set of gate-level actions applied to existing circuits. We evaluate the local quantum architecture search algorithm on two synthetic function-fitting regression tasks and two quantum chemistry regression datasets, including the BSE49 dataset of bond separation energies for first- and second-row elements and a dataset of water conformers generated using the data-driven coupled-cluster approach. Using state-vector simulation, our results highlight the applicability of local quantum architecture search algorithm for identifying competitive circuit architectures with desirable performance metrics. Lastly, we analyze the properties of the discovered circuits and demonstrate the deployment of the best-performing model on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.

Motivation: To establish a rigorous mathematical framework for optimal quantum feedback control in infinite-dimensional settings, addressing the stabilization of continuously monitored quantum systems like qubit networks where traditional finite-dimensional methods fail.

Method: Embedding the quantum state space into Hilbert-Schmidt space to formulate a dynamic programming principle; analyzing mean-field limits of Ising-coupled qubit systems under continuous monitoring.

Conclusion: The infinite-dimensional DP framework enables effective stabilization of complex quantum systems through feedback, providing a theoretical foundation for controlling large-scale quantum networks.

Abstract: Working within the quantum filtering framework, we establish a dynamic programming principle in an infinite-dimensional setting by embedding the state space into the Hilbert-Schmidt space. We then study a stabilization problem for continuously monitored Ising-coupled qubits and, in the mean-field limit, demonstrate quantum state reduction together with exponential convergence toward prescribed eigenstates under suitable feedback laws.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出压缩感知影子层析（CSST）协议，通过结合经典阴影（降低可观测量维度）和压缩感知（利用时间维度稀疏性），显著减少量子模拟中测量局部期望值所需的设备采样次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子模拟和设备表征中，随时间测量多个局部期望值存在严重的"测量瓶颈"问题，传统方法需大量设备采样（shots），资源消耗巨大。

Method: 1. 采用局部经典阴影技术：从固定时间的随机快照中同时估计多个Pauli期望值，降低可观测量维度；2. 应用压缩感知：假设期望值信号在傅里叶等酉变换基下具有稀疏性，仅随机采样m≪N个时间点，通过ℓ₁优化重构完整时间序列信号。

Result: 1. 对于精确s-稀疏信号，仅需m=O(s log²s log N)个随机时间点（高概率成立）；2. 总采样次数相比全时间采样（N次）节省至Ñ(N/s)量级（忽略多对数因子）；3. 近似稀疏信号的重构误差可分解为可压缩性尾部项和噪声项；4. 数值实验验证了多量子比特动力学中Pauli迹的强傅里叶可压缩性及显著采样减少效果。

Conclusion: CSST协议通过双重维度约减，在保证精度的前提下大幅降低量子测量资源需求，为大规模量子模拟和设备表征提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating many local expectation values over time is a central measurement bottleneck in quantum simulation and device characterization. We study the task of reconstructing the Pauli-signal matrix $S_{ij}=\text{Tr}(O_i ρ(t_j))$ for a collection of $M$ low-weight Pauli observables $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^M$ over $N$ timesteps $\{t_j\}_{j=1}^N$, while minimizing the total number of device shots. We propose a Compressed Sensing Shadow Tomography (CSST) protocol that combines two complementary reductions. First, local classical shadows reduce the observable dimension by enabling many Pauli expectation values to be estimated from the same randomized snapshots at a fixed time. Second, compressed sensing reduces the time dimension by exploiting the fact that many expectation-value traces are spectrally sparse or compressible in a unitary (e.g., Fourier) transform basis. Operationally, CSST samples $m\ll N$ timesteps uniformly at random, collects shadows only at those times, and then reconstructs each length-$N$ signal via standard $\ell_1$-based recovery in the unitary transform domain. We provide end-to-end guarantees that explicitly combine shadow estimation error with compressed sensing recovery bounds. For exactly $s$-sparse signals in a unitary transform basis, we show that $m=O \left(s\log^2 s \log N\right)$ random timesteps suffice (with high probability), leading to total-shot savings scaling as $\widetildeΘ(N/s)$ (i.e., up to polylogarithmic factors) relative to collecting shadows at all $N$ timesteps. For approximately sparse signals, the reconstruction error decomposes into a compressibility (tail) term plus a noise term. We present numerical experiments on noisy many-qubit dynamics that support strong Fourier compressibility of Pauli traces and demonstrate substantial shot reductions with accurate reconstruction.

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种基于特殊设计的三配位晶格的三维Floquet量子纠错码，该码在测量周期中保持逻辑量子比特，仅通过双体测量即可实现容错量子计算，同时揭示了与监测量子系统中拓扑相的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 将二维Hastings-Haah Kekulé晶格推广到三维三配位晶格，其特点是删除任意边颜色都会产生短闭合回路而非非平凡链；设计保持三个逻辑量子比特的测量方案，并附加序列在不扰动逻辑子空间的情况下提取完整的错误综合征。

Result: 该晶格的环路结构防止了逻辑信息崩溃；附加测量协议成功提取完整错误综合征同时保持逻辑子空间；该几何结构还定义了三维监测Kitaev模型，展现出动态创建的拓扑相和量子临界点。

Conclusion: 通过工程化晶格几何结构的高维Floquet码能够通过经济高效的双体测量实现鲁棒的容错量子计算，与随机监测量子系统中的拓扑相和临界现象存在直接联系。

Abstract: Floquet quantum error-correcting codes provide an operationally economical route to fault tolerance by dynamically generating stabilizer structures using only two-body Pauli measurements. But while it is well established that stabilizer codes in higher spatial dimensions gain additional levels of intrinsic robustness, higher-dimensional Floquet codes have hitherto been explored only in limited scope. Here we introduce a 3d generalization of a Floquet code whose instantaneous stabilizer group realizes a 3d fermionic toric code, while crucially preserving all three logical qubits throughout the entire measurement sequence. One central ingredient is the identification of a 3d lattice geometry that generalizes the features of the Kekulé lattice underlying the 2d Hastings-Haah code - specifically, a structure where deleting any one edge color yields a two-color subgraph that decomposes into short, closed loops rather than homologically nontrivial chains. This loop property avoids the collapse of logical information that plagues naive sequential two-color measurement schedules on many 3d lattices. Although, for our lattice geometry, a simple 3-round cycle that sequentially measures the three types of parity checks does not expose the full error syndrome set, we show that one can append a measurement sequence to extract the missing syndromes without disturbing the logical subspace. Beyond code design, 3d tricoordinated lattice geometries define a family of 3d monitored Kitaev models, in which random measurements of the non-commuting parity checks give rise to dynamically created entangled phases with nontrivial topology. In discussing the general structure of their underlying phase diagrams and, in particular, the existence of certain quantum critical points, we again make a connection to the general preservation of logical information in time-ordered Floquet protocols.

Conclusion: 所提方法通过利用单采样轨迹和优化测量策略，突破了传统独立采样限制，为量子热态模拟提供了更高效的观测值估计方案。

Abstract: Estimating thermal expectation values of observables is a fundamental task in quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and materials science. While recent quantum algorithms have enabled efficient quantum preparation of thermal states, observable estimation via sampling remains costly: a straightforward implementation separates successive measurements by a full mixing time in order to ensure samples are approximately independent. In this work, we show that the sampling cost can be substantially reduced by using a single Gibbs-sampling trajectory. After a single burn-in period, we interleave coherent measurements that satisfy detailed balance with respect to the target Gibbs state. The efficiency of this approach rests on the fact that, in many settings, the autocorrelation time can be significantly shorter than the mixing time. For energy estimation (and more generally for observables commuting with the Hamiltonian), we implement the required measurements using Gaussian-filtered quantum phase estimation with only logarithmic overhead. We also introduce a weighted operator Fourier transform technique to mitigate measurement-induced disturbance for general observables.

TL;DR: 建立了时间准周期GKSL方程渐近行为的完整分类理论，提出基于生成元代数的稳态唯一性判据，并揭示强对称性在不同绘景下的物理意义：相互作用绘景强对称性导致含时稳态（如相干振荡），薛定谔绘景强对称性决定时间无关稳态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解含时耗散量子系统的长期行为对量子控制至关重要。现有理论缺乏对时间准周期GKSL方程渐近动力学的系统分类，且强对称性概念在含时情形下的作用机制尚不明确，无法有效指导非平衡稳态的设计与调控。

Method: 基于生成元代数建立稳态唯一性的充要条件判据；将强对称性概念扩展到含时GKSL方程，分别定义薛定谔绘景和相互作用绘景下的强对称性，并严格分类其对应的渐近动力学行为。

Result: 1. 获得解析含时生成元下稳态唯一性的完整判据，在量子多体自旋链等典型模型中验证；2. 发现相互作用绘景强对称性是非平凡含时稳态（如相干振荡）的根源，而薛定谔绘景强对称性控制时间无关稳态的存在；3. 统一并拓展了强动力学对称性和Floquet动力学对称性等已有机制。

Abstract: We present a rigorous and comprehensive classification of the asymptotic behavior of time-quasiperiodic Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equations under the assumption of Hermitian jump operators. Our main contributions are twofold: first, we establish a criterion for the uniqueness of steady states. The criterion is formulated in terms of the algebra generated by the GKSL generators and provides a necessary and sufficient condition when the generators are analytic functions of time. We demonstrate the utility of our criterion through prototypical examples, including quantum many-body spin chains. Second, we extend the concept of strong symmetry for time-dependent GKSL equations by introducing two distinct forms, strong symmetry in the Schrödinger picture and that in the interaction picture, and completely classify the asymptotic dynamics with them. More concretely, we rigorously uncover that the strong symmetry in the interaction picture is responsible for non-trivial time-dependent steady states, such as coherent oscillations, whereas that in the Schrödinger picture controls the existence of time-independent steady states. This classification not only encompasses established mechanisms underlying non-trivial oscillatory steady states, such as strong dynamical symmetry and Floquet dynamical symmetry, but also reveals symmetry-predicted, time-dependent asymptotic dynamics in a novel class of open quantum systems. Our framework thus provides a rigorous foundation for controlling dissipative quantum systems in a time-dependent manner.

Abstract: We establish a systematic classification scheme for multipartite entanglement structures. We define Sperner states -- a broad class of states where apparent multipartite entanglement decomposes into fewer-partite entanglement among subsystems of each party. Each class of Sperner states is associated with one antichain hypergraph and each hypergraph encodes the maximal entanglement structure permissible under its constraints. We introduce a Multi-entanglement Measure Space (MEMS) where each Sperner class corresponds to a linear subspace defined by the vanishing of specific linear combinations of bipartite and multipartite measures. The nonvanishing of such combinations signals multipartite entanglement beyond the associated hypergraph, thereby distinguishing entanglement structures. We build a two way connection between each hypergraph entanglement structure and a distinct set of combinations, thereby quantifying the entanglement pattern and providing a unified basis for classifying all multipartite entanglement.

Abstract: A quantum backflow state refers to a quantum state exhibiting negative probability density flux albeit a completely positive momentum spectrum. Extending earlier work that uses single laser pulse to prepare quantum backflow state in an ultracold atomic BEC [1], we theoretical investigated flexible quantum backflow state preparation via large momentum transfer technique, which to our knowledge, has not been studied before. By combining atom interferometry theory and non-interacting BEC wave function, we solve for the evolution of a BEC wavepacket under atom interferometry sequence. Simulation results show a highly tunable backflow flux and critical density under our scheme, and can be manipulated to go beyond existing numbers.

TL;DR: This paper presents a wafer-scale quantum packaging architecture supporting over 500 superconducting qubits with median coherence times of ~100 μs, readout fidelity of 97.5%, and qubit temperature of 36 mK.

Abstract: Packages capable of supporting large arrays of high-coherence superconducting qubits are vital for the realisation of fault-tolerant quantum computers and the necessary high-throughput metrology required to optimise fabrication and manufacturing processes. We present a wafer-scale packaging architecture supporting over 500 qubits on a single 3-inch die. The package is engineered to suppress parasitic RF modes, and to mitigate material loss through simulation-informed design while managing differential thermal contraction to ensure robust operation at millikelvin temperatures. System-level heat-load calculations from a large wiring payload show this package may be operated in commercial dilution refrigerators. Measurements of the qubits loaded into the package show median $T_1$, $T_{2e} \sim 100~μ$s ($\sim$100 qubits) alongside readout with median fidelity of 97.5% (54 qubits) and a median qubit temperature of 36 mK (54 qubits). These results validate the performance of these packages and demonstrate that large-scale integration can be achieved without compromising device performance. Finally, we highlight the utility of these packages as a tool for high throughput feedback on qubit figures of merit over large sample sizes, allowing identification of performance outliers in the tails of the coherence distribution, a critical capability for informing fabrication and manufacture of high-quality quantum qubits and quantum processors.

Abstract: The temperature sensitivity of a probe in equilibrium can be gauged by its thermal quantum Fisher information (QFI). It is known that probes exhibiting degeneracy in their energy-level structure can achieve larger sensitivities, while probes with a more uniform spectrum may remain sensitive over a broader temperature range. Here, we study the thermometric performance of a multilevel quantum Rabi model in which two well-separated atomic manifolds of near-degenerate levels couple to a single cavity mode. We generalise the standard quantum Rabi treatment in the adiabatic regime to find an approximate closed-form expression for the thermal QFI. We then characterise two complementary limits. On the one hand, a large dark-state manifold (dark-manifold saturation) produces a robust peak in thermal sensitivity due to bright--dark population transfer. Such increase in sensitivity is further maximised at an intermediate light--matter coupling strength. Maximising instead the number of bright states (bright-manifold saturation) generates a broadband thermal response that becomes increasingly stable under random light--matter couplings as the number of levels is increased. The rich spectral structure of our cavity-QED model thus makes it a versatile and sensitive equilibrium thermometer over a broad range of temperatures.

*Abhijit Kundu,Vijay Bhatt,Arijit Sharma*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A cavity-based EIT technique for measuring ion temperature and phonon occupation near motional ground state, using cavity probe transmission scanning in strong coupling regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ion thermometry methods lack efficiency for sub-Doppler cooled ions near ground state; this technique simplifies measurement by leveraging cavity EIT to extract phonon occupation.

Method: Monitor cavity probe transmission while scanning probe laser frequency after establishing cavity EIT with control beam; correlate EIT linewidth with ion's thermal state.

Result: Theoretical model links EIT linewidth to ion temperature and motional phonon state; enables thermometry in sub-Doppler cooling regime via transmission analysis.

Conclusion: Valid only in resolved-sideband regime (secular frequencies ~10 MHz) where motional states are selectively addressable; provides simplified ground-state ion thermometry.

Abstract: We present a technique for measuring ion temperature using cavity-based electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) applicable for cavity-qed systems in the strong coupling regime. This method enables efficient extraction of the ion's phonon occupation number following sub-Doppler cooling close to the motional ground state. The proposed method relies on monitoring the cavity probe transmission while scanning the probe laser frequency once cavity EIT is established using the control beam, significantly simplifying the measurement procedure. We theoretically establish a model that demonstrates influence of thermal state of the trapped ion vis a vis the EIT linewidth measured. We show how the cavity EIT transmission may be used as a thermometry tool to deduce the ion temperature as well as the motional state for an ion in the sub-Doppler cooling regime. The current method can only be used for operation in the resolved-sideband regime, where individual motional states can be selectively addressed for all relevant transitions either by selecting appropriate energy levels for the three-level system or by employing strong confinement with high secular frequencies ($\sim 10 MHz$).

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing hinges on efficient logical compilation, in particular, translating high-level circuits into code-compatible implementations. Gate-by-gate compilation often yields deep circuits, requiring significant overhead to ensure fault-tolerance. As an alternative, we investigate the compilation of primitives from quantum simulation as single blocks. We focus our study on the [[n,n-2,2]] code family, which allows for the exhaustive comparison of potential compilation primitives on small circuit instances. Based upon that, we then introduce a methodology that lifts these primitives into size-invariant, depth-efficient compilation strategies. This recovers known methods for circuits with moderate Hadamard counts and yields improved realizations for sparse and dense placements. Simulations show significant error-rate reductions in the compiled circuits. We envision the approach as a core component of peephole-based compilers. Its flexibility and low hand-crafting burden make it readily extensible to other circuit structures and code families.

Abstract: Polar molecules, with their rich internal structure, offer immense potential for fundamental physics, quantum technology, and controlled chemistry. However, their utilization is currently limited because of slow and imperfect state detection and weak dipolar interaction, limiting fast and large-scale entanglement generation. We propose and analyze a scheme for quantum logic control and measurement-based state preparation in a hybrid platform of polar molecules and neutral atoms. The method leverages fast, high-fidelity atom-molecule gates and high-fidelity atomic ancilla measurements to overcome the common challenges in molecule-only platforms, while preserving their diverse structural advantages. The proposed atom-molecule controlled-phase gate is based on resonant dipole-dipole exchange between a molecular rotational transition and an atomic Rydberg transition, rendering it three orders of magnitude faster than any direct molecule-molecule entangling gate. We further study several applications of our scheme including the preparation of molecular GHZ states for quantum enhanced precision measurements, the preparation of exotic molecular qudit states with topological order, and measurement-altered criticality. Our scheme is applicable to any polar molecule. It expands the paradigm of quantum logic control and paves the way to large-scale molecular entangled states. More generally, it highlights a concrete hybrid quantum system in which each qubit is utilized in an optimal way and where the measurement-based approach can yield a significant advantage in near-term devices.

Abstract: We present an effective potential that allows quantum thermal expectation values of a position-dependent observable to be estimated as a classical ensemble average of the corresponding function. We follow the approach of Feynman and Hibbs, but perform the mean-field treatment of quantum fluctuations about the path starting point rather than the path centroid. Furthermore, rather than performing a full variational optimization of the potential, we explore approximate functional forms that yield a numerical robustness. The resulting closed-form potential is exact in the classical and harmonic limits; benchmarks against exact position distributions for one-dimensional quartic, Morse, and double-well potentials, show good agreement for potentials with harmonic support.

Abstract: Quantum metrology exploits quantum mechanical effects to increase the precision of measurements of physical quantities. A wide variety of applications are currently being developed for scientific and technological purposes, however, most research relies on the use of highly entangled resource states that are challenging to generate and control in a given physical system. Here, we study the use of weighted graph states as more accessible resources for quantum metrology, which yield a favorable precision beyond the classical limit, approaching the Heisenberg limit. We find a notable robustness to variation in weights and less challenging weight requirements compared to standard graph states, which require a maximal weight at all edges. Both of these aspects reduce the practical demands in a physical setup, with the latter implying significantly less entanglement is required to gain a quantum advantage in metrology. We study the quantum Fisher information and optimized estimator variance of two identified sub classes of weighted graph states for an arbitrary number of N qubits, providing analytical forms and investigating their scaling. Our work opens up opportunities for using weakly entangled states in quantum-enhanced metrology.

Motivation: 研究纯量子态在希尔伯特空间中如何均匀分布这一基本问题。标准韦尔奇界在态数量低于精确k-设计要求时会失效，因此需要开发在此情况下仍保持信息性的新界限。

Result: 与韦尔奇界的偏差捕捉了平均情况下的近似误差，刻画了固定基数下的最小可达误差。对于k=3，SICs和完整MUB集饱和了这些界限，使其成为最优近似3-设计。这引出了排除完整MUB集存在性的变分准则，并获得了维度6中反对此类集合的数值证据。

Conclusion: 强化的韦尔奇界为在精确设计不可能的情况下量子态的最优分布提供了自然框架。SICs和MUBs在k=3时的最优性，加上d=6时完整MUB集不存在的证据，深化了我们对量子设计和互无偏基的理解。部分转置对称子空间投影算子谱的计算结果可能具有更广泛的应用。

Abstract: A fundamental question asks how uniformly finite sets of pure quantum states can be distributed in a Hilbert space. The Welch bounds address this question, and are saturated by $k$-designs, i.e. sets of states reproducing the $k$-th Haar moments. However, these bounds quickly become uninformative when the number of states is below that required for an exact $k$-design. We derive strengthened Welch-type inequalities that remain sharp in this regime by exploiting rank constraints from partial transposition and spectral properties of the partially transposed Haar moment operator. We prove that the deviation from the Welch bound captures the average-case approximation error, hence characterizing a natural notion of minimum achievable error at fixed cardinality. For $k=3$, we prove that SICs and complete MUB sets saturate our bounds, making them optimal approximate 3-designs of their cardinality. This leads a natural variational criterion to rule out the existence of a complete set MUBs, which we use to obtain numerical evidence against such set in dimension $6$. As a key technical ingredient, we compute the complete spectrum of the partially transposed symmetric-subspace projector, including multiplicities and eigenvectors, which may find applications beyond the present work.

Abstract: Pauli channels are widely used to describe errors in quantum computers, particularly when noise is shaped via Pauli twirling. A common assumption is that such channels admit a Markovian generator, namely a Pauli-Lindblad model with non-negative rates, but the validity of this assumption has not been systematically examined. Here, using CP-indivisibility as our criterion for non-Markovianity, we study multi-qubit Pauli channels from a single snapshot of the dynamics. We find that while the generator always has the same structure as the standard Pauli-Lindblad model, the rates may be negative or complex. We show that random Pauli channels are almost always non-Markovian, with the probability of encountering a negative rate converging doubly exponentially to unity with the number of qubits. For physically motivated noise models shaped by Pauli twirling, including single-qubit over-rotations and two-qubit amplitude damping errors, we find that negative rates are generic, even when the underlying physical noise is Markovian. We generalize probabilistic error amplification and cancellation to non-Markovian generators, and quantify the sampling overhead introduced by negative and complex rates. Experiments on superconducting qubits confirm that allowing negative rates in the learned noise model yields more accurate predictions than restricting to non-negative rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit operator forms of the Hamiltonian of mean force for strong-coupling thermodynamics are known only in restricted settings, limiting general applications.

Method: The quenched density framework applies Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to rewrite reduced equilibrium states as averages over local imaginary-time propagators, separating environment statistics from system response.

Result: For harmonic environments with coupling commuting with the system Hamiltonian, the HMF correction has an exact closed-form expression, validated against finite-bath trace-out calculations and stochastic sampling in a five-level projector-coupled model.

Conclusion: This framework provides a rigorous approach to strong-coupling thermodynamics with potential for broader applications beyond the minimal cases tested.

Abstract: The Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) provides the standard starting point for strong-coupling thermodynamics, yet explicit operator forms are known only in restricted settings. We present a quenched density framework that uses the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to rewrite the reduced equilibrium state as an average over local propagators in imaginary time. This approach rigorously separates the statistical definition of the environment from the algebraic structure of the system response. We apply this framework to the minimal case of a harmonic environment with a coupling commuting with the system Hamiltonian. In this scenario the correction to the HMF has an exact, closed-form expression. We validate this result against finite-bath trace-out calculations and stochastic imaginary-time sampling in a five-level projector-coupled model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OptiML is a two-stage framework that uses LLM-driven search under verification to automatically generate high-performance CUDA kernels from natural language or existing code, outperforming existing LLM baselines through systematic exploration and profiler-guided optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating high-performance CUDA kernels is challenging due to the vast combinatorial space of low-level transformations and expensive hardware profiling feedback. While LLMs can produce functionally correct code, they struggle to systematically explore and verify optimization choices to achieve competitive performance.

Method: The paper proposes OptiML, a two-stage framework: (1) OptiML-G uses a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator to propose kernel implementations from natural language; (2) OptiML-X applies Monte Carlo Tree Search with LLM-driven edits, guided by hardware-aware rewards from Nsight Compute profiling. Each candidate is compiled, verified, and evaluated using a composite objective combining runtime, bottleneck proxies, and regression guardrails.

Result: Evaluation on diverse CUDA kernels shows OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines and produces interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence.

Conclusion: The framework successfully automates CUDA kernel optimization by combining LLM-driven search with systematic verification, making high-performance GPU programming more accessible and achieving better results than existing approaches.

Abstract: Generating high-performance CUDA kernels remains challenging due to the need to navigate a combinatorial space of low-level transformations under noisy and expensive hardware feedback. Although large language models can synthesize functionally correct CUDA code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices. We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels. Results show that OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines and produces interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence.

Abstract: We want language model assistants to conform to a character specification, which asserts how the model should act across diverse user interactions. While models typically follow these character specifications, they can occasionally violate them in large-scale deployments. In this work, we aim to identify types of queries that are likely to produce such character violations at deployment, using much less than deployment-level compute. To do this, we introduce abstractive red-teaming, where we search for natural-language query categories, e.g. "The query is in Chinese. The query asks about family roles," that routinely elicit violations. These categories abstract over the many possible variants of a query which could appear in the wild. We introduce two algorithms for efficient category search against a character-trait-specific reward model: one based on reinforcement learning on a category generator LLM, and another which leverages a strong LLM to iteratively synthesize categories from high-scoring queries. Across a 12-principle character specification and 7 target models, we find that our algorithms consistently outperform baselines, and generate qualitatively interesting categories; for example, queries which ask Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to predict the future lead to responses saying that AI will dominate humanity, and queries that ask GPT-4.1-Mini for essential prison survival items lead to enthusiastic recommendation of illegal weapons. Overall, we believe our results represent an important step towards realistic pre-deployment auditing of language model character.

### [30] [The Appeal and Reality of Recycling LoRAs with Adaptive Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12323)
*Haokun Liu,Gyung Hyun Je,Marco Ciccone,Zhenlin Xu,Prasanth YSS,Colin Raffel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探索了从近1000个用户贡献的Llama 3.1模型LoRA中回收利用并自适应合并的方法。发现自适应合并虽能超越基础模型，但相比在同数据上训练新LoRA提升有限；合并的LoRA选择并不重要，甚至使用随机初始化的LoRA也能获得相似性能，表明该方法可能主要通过正则化效应而非跨任务迁移起作用。不过在高度相关的LoRA存在时，正向迁移确实可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自适应合并方法虽有效，但尚未有研究探索从Hugging Face Hub等模型库中"野生"LoRA的回收利用，这是实际应用中重要的场景。

Method: 构建包含近1000个用户贡献LoRA的池（均从Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct训练），系统评估多种自适应/非自适应合并方法，并通过广泛搜索设计新方法，与基础模型及同数据训练新LoRA进行对比。

Result: 1) 自适应合并超越基础模型但相对训练新LoRA收益有限；2) 具体LoRA选择对性能影响不大；3) 使用随机初始化LoRA可获得相似效果；4) 存在高度相关LoRA时正向迁移可行；5) 表明合并效果可能源于正则化而非跨任务迁移。

Conclusion: 从公共LoRA池的自适应合并主要产生正则化效应，而非实现正向跨任务迁移；仅在池中存在高度相关LoRA时才可能获得实质性迁移收益。

Abstract: The widespread availability of fine-tuned LoRA modules for open pre-trained models has led to an interest in methods that can adaptively merge LoRAs to improve performance. These methods typically include some way of selecting LoRAs from a pool and tune merging coefficients based on a task-specific dataset. While adaptive merging methods have demonstrated improvements in some settings, no past work has attempted to recycle LoRAs found "in the wild" on model repositories like the Hugging Face Hub. To address this gap, we consider recycling from a pool of nearly 1,000 user-contributed LoRAs trained from the Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct language model. Our empirical study includes a range of adaptive and non-adaptive merging methods in addition to a new method designed via a wide search over the methodological design space. We demonstrate that adaptive merging methods can improve performance over the base model but provide limited benefit over training a new LoRA on the same data used to set merging coefficients. We additionally find not only that the specific choice of LoRAs to merge has little importance, but that using LoRAs with randomly initialized parameter values yields similar performance. This raises the possibility that adaptive merging from recycled LoRAs primarily works via some kind of regularization effect, rather than by enabling positive cross-task transfer. To better understand why past work has proven successful, we confirm that positive transfer is indeed possible when there are highly relevant LoRAs in the pool. We release the model checkpoints and code online.

*Farshad Zeinali,Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi,Dusit Niyato,Rahim Tafazolli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid RL framework combining DQN and DDPG for Tokenizer Agreement in multi-user downlink TokenCom, achieving 68% reduction in video freezing compared to H.265 while improving semantic quality and resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient TokenCom, transmitters and receivers must establish a shared semantic latent space through Tokenizer Agreement (TA), requiring selection of identical tokenizer models/codebooks from pre-trained options for semantic- and goal-oriented communications.

Method: The authors formulate a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem for multi-user downlink TokenCom and solve it with a hybrid RL framework: DQN handles joint tokenizer agreement and sub-channel assignment, while DDPG optimizes beamforming.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate superiority over baseline methods in semantic quality and resource efficiency, with a 68% reduction in video transmission freezing events compared to conventional H.265.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid RL framework effectively addresses the TA challenge in multi-user TokenCom, validating the paradigm's potential for improving wireless video transmission performance.

Abstract: Token Communications (TokenCom) has recently emerged as an effective new paradigm, where tokens are the unified units of multimodal communications and computations, enabling efficient digital semantic- and goal-oriented communications in future wireless networks. To establish a shared semantic latent space, the transmitters/receivers in TokenCom need to agree on an identical tokenizer model and codebook. To this end, an initial Tokenizer Agreement (TA) process is carried out in each communication episode, where the transmitter/receiver cooperate to choose from a set of pre-trained tokenizer models/ codebooks available to them both for efficient TokenCom. In this correspondence, we investigate TA in a multi-user downlink wireless TokenCom scenario, where the base station equipped with multiple antennas transmits video token streams to multiple users. We formulate the corresponding mixed-integer non-convex problem, and propose a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates a deep Q-network (DQN) for joint tokenizer agreement and sub-channel assignment, with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed framework outperforms baseline methods in terms of semantic quality and resource efficiency, while reducing the freezing events in video transmission by 68% compared to the conventional H.265-based scheme.

*Ilze Amanda Auzina,Joschka Strüber,Sergio Hernández-Gutiérrez,Shashwat Goel,Ameya Prabhu,Matthias Bethge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes ΔBelief-RL, a method that uses language models' changing beliefs about solutions to provide intermediate rewards for long-horizon RL tasks, outperforming outcome-based rewards and scaling effectively at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training agents to handle long-horizon uncertainty is challenging because traditional outcome-based rewards provide sparse signals that make credit assignment to intermediate actions difficult.

Method: ΔBelief-RL leverages the change in probability (Δ) that a language model assigns to target solutions as an intrinsic reward signal for reinforcement learning, trained on synthetic interaction data.

Result: The method consistently outperforms purely outcome-based RL rewards, generalizes to out-of-distribution tasks like customer service and personalization, shows continued improvement with increased test-time interactions, and improves interaction efficiency on Pass@k metrics.

Conclusion: The work presents a scalable training strategy for long-horizon uncertainty navigation by enabling credit assignment through intrinsic ΔBelief rewards derived from language models' own belief changes.

Abstract: How can we train agents to navigate uncertainty over long horizons? In this work, we propose ΔBelief-RL, which leverages a language model's own intrinsic beliefs to reward intermediate progress. Our method utilizes the change in the probability an agent assigns to the target solution for credit assignment. By training on synthetic interaction data, ΔBelief-RL teaches information-seeking capabilities that consistently outperform purely outcome-based rewards for Reinforcement Learning, with improvements generalizing to out-of-distribution applications ranging from customer service to personalization. Notably, the performance continues to improve as we scale test-time interactions beyond the training horizon, with interaction-efficiency increasing even on Pass@k metrics. Overall, our work introduces a scalable training strategy for navigating uncertainty over a long-horizon, by enabling credit assignment to intermediate actions via intrinsic ΔBelief rewards.

Motivation: 阿片类药物危机是美国最严重的公共卫生危机之一，但评估政策干预措施困难，因为多个政策在动态系统中相互作用，针对一个风险途径可能无意中放大另一个。

Method: 提出Policy4OOD，一个知识引导的时空世界模型，将政策知识图谱、州级空间依赖性和社会经济时间序列编码到政策条件Transformer中，用于预测未来opioid结果。训练后，该世界模型作为模拟器使用，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索进行政策优化。

Result: 实验表明，空间依赖性和结构化政策知识显著提高了预测准确性，验证了每个架构组件的有效性。

Conclusion: 世界建模在数据驱动的公共卫生决策支持方面具有潜力，能够有效评估opioid政策干预措施。

Abstract: The opioid epidemic remains one of the most severe public health crises in the United States, yet evaluating policy interventions before implementation is difficult: multiple policies interact within a dynamic system where targeting one risk pathway may inadvertently amplify another. We argue that effective opioid policy evaluation requires three capabilities -- forecasting future outcomes under current policies, counterfactual reasoning about alternative past decisions, and optimization over candidate interventions -- and propose to unify them through world modeling. We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乐观价值估计方法只能在获得更高奖励后追溯性地增加价值奖励，无法激励智能体首次访问状态-动作对

Method: 提出VBE算法，维护一个随机动作价值函数（RQF）的集成，利用这些函数的估计误差来设计可降至零的价值奖励，实现首次访问乐观和深度探索

Result: 在多个经典探索测试环境中，VBE优于Bootstrap DQN、RND和ACB三种奖励奖励方法，并能轻松扩展到Atari等复杂环境

Conclusion: VBE算法有效解决了强化学习中的首次访问探索问题，在简单和复杂环境中均表现出强大的探索性能

Abstract: Optimistic value estimates provide one mechanism for directed exploration in reinforcement learning (RL). The agent acts greedily with respect to an estimate of the value plus what can be seen as a value bonus. The value bonus can be learned by estimating a value function on reward bonuses, propagating local uncertainties around rewards. However, this approach only increases the value bonus for an action retroactively, after seeing a higher reward bonus from that state and action. Such an approach does not encourage the agent to visit a state and action for the first time. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for exploration called Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors (VBE), that maintains an ensemble of random action-value functions (RQFs). VBE uses the errors in the estimation of these RQFs to design value bonuses that provide first-visit optimism and deep exploration. The key idea is to design the rewards for these RQFs in such a way that the value bonus can decrease to zero. We show that VBE outperforms Bootstrap DQN and two reward bonus approaches (RND and ACB) on several classic environments used to test exploration and provide demonstrative experiments that it can scale easily to more complex environments like Atari.

*Wenxin Chen,Weishen Pan,Kyra Gan,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D3-Net solves error propagation in longitudinal treatment effect estimation by using Sequential Doubly Robust pseudo-outcomes during training and Longitudinal TMLE for final robust estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating longitudinal treatment effects is challenging due to treatment-confounder feedback, and existing ICE G-computation methods suffer from error propagation that corrupts outcome regression models.

Method: 1) Trains ICE sequence using Sequential Doubly Robust pseudo-outcomes to interrupt error propagation; 2) Uses multi-task Transformer with covariate simulator head for regularization and target network for stability; 3) Applies uncorrected models with Longitudinal TMLE for final targeted debiasing.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show D3-Net robustly reduces bias and variance across different time horizons, counterfactual scenarios, and time-varying confoundings compared to state-of-the-art ICE-based estimators.

Conclusion: D3-Net effectively mitigates error propagation in longitudinal causal estimation through its two-stage approach (SDR training + LTMLE final correction), achieving superior robustness and finite-sample performance.

Abstract: Estimating longitudinal treatment effects is essential for sequential decision-making but is challenging due to treatment-confounder feedback. While Iterative Conditional Expectation (ICE) G-computation offers a principled approach, its recursive structure suffers from error propagation, corrupting the learned outcome regression models. We propose D3-Net, a framework that mitigates error propagation in ICE training and then applies a robust final correction. First, to interrupt error propagation during learning, we train the ICE sequence using Sequential Doubly Robust (SDR) pseudo-outcomes, which provide bias-corrected targets for each regression. Second, we employ a multi-task Transformer with a covariate simulator head for auxiliary supervision, regularizing representations against corruption by noisy pseudo-outcomes, and a target network to stabilize training dynamics. For the final estimate, we discard the SDR correction and instead use the uncorrected nuisance models to perform Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (LTMLE) on the original outcomes. This second-stage, targeted debiasing ensures robustness and optimal finite-sample properties. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model, D3-Net, robustly reduces bias and variance across different horizons, counterfactuals, and time-varying confoundings, compared to existing state-of-the-art ICE-based estimators.

TL;DR: 该论文研究在有限统计量下学习吉布斯分布的问题，以伊辛模型为例，证明对于ℓ₁宽度为γ的模型，观测至O(γ)阶统计量即可重建参数、推断结构并学习耦合和磁场，且结构先验可进一步降低观测需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多物理系统中的吉布斯分布难以获得完整样本配置，现有高效学习算法需完整样本而不实用，而仅用充分统计量的方法计算困难，因此需要研究有限观测下的高效学习方法。

Method: 以伊辛模型为范例分析计算能力与观测能力之间的权衡，通过ℓ₁宽度γ量化模型复杂度，并确定所需统计量的阶数。

Result: 对于ℓ₁宽度为γ的伊辛模型，观测至O(γ)阶统计量足以重建模型参数、推断结构并学习耦合和磁场；若已知结构先验，则所需观测能力可进一步降低。

Conclusion: 有限观测下实现吉布斯分布的高效学习是可行的，特别是在具备结构先验时，这为完整样本难以获取的物理系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Learning Gibbs distributions using only sufficient statistics has long been recognized as a computationally hard problem. On the other hand, computationally efficient algorithms for learning Gibbs distributions rely on access to full sample configurations generated from the model. For many systems of interest that arise in physical contexts, expecting a full sample to be observed is not practical, and hence it is important to look for computationally efficient methods that solve the learning problem with access to only a limited set of statistics. We examine the trade-offs between the power of computation and observation within this scenario, employing the Ising model as a paradigmatic example. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reconstruct the model parameters for a model with $\ell_1$ width $γ$ by observing statistics up to an order of $O(γ)$. This approach allows us to infer the model's structure and also learn its couplings and magnetic fields. We also discuss a setting where prior information about structure of the model is available and show that the learning problem can be solved efficiently with even more limited observational power.

Conclusion: TRLSE通过双级采集机制有效应对高维水平集估计挑战，兼具理论严谨性和实际性能优势。

Abstract: Level set estimation (LSE) classifies whether an unknown function's value exceeds a specified threshold for given inputs, a fundamental problem in many real-world applications. In active learning settings with limited initial data, we aim to iteratively acquire informative points to construct an accurate classifier for this task. In high-dimensional spaces, this becomes challenging where the search volume grows exponentially with increasing dimensionality. We propose TRLSE, an algorithm for high-dimensional LSE, which identifies and refines regions near the threshold boundary with dual acquisition functions operating at both global and local levels. We provide a theoretical analysis of TRLSE's accuracy and show its superior sample efficiency against existing methods through extensive evaluations on multiple synthetic and real-world LSE problems.

Abstract: Analog and mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) lie at the core of modern computing and communications systems. However, despite the continued rise in design complexity, advances in AMS automation remain limited. This reflects the central challenge in developing a generalized optimization method applicable across diverse circuit design spaces, many of which are distinct, constrained, and non-differentiable. To address this, our work casts circuit design as a graph generation problem and introduces a novel method of AMS synthesis driven by deep reinforcement learning (AstRL). Based on a policy-gradient approach, AstRL generates circuits directly optimized for user-specified targets within a simulator-embedded environment that provides ground-truth feedback during training. Through behavioral-cloning and discriminator-based similarity rewards, our method demonstrates, for the first time, an expert-aligned paradigm for generalized circuit generation validated in simulation. Importantly, the proposed approach operates at the level of individual transistors, enabling highly expressive, fine-grained topology generation. Strong inductive biases encoded in the action space and environment further drive structurally consistent and valid generation. Experimental results for three realistic design tasks illustrate substantial improvements in conventional design metrics over state-of-the-art baselines, with 100% of generated designs being structurally correct and over 90% demonstrating required functionality.

Motivation: LLM训练数据若混入基准测试数据会产生评估偏差，而现有n-gram匹配方法无法识别语义重复内容，这种软污染问题严重影响对模型泛化能力的准确判断。

Method: 通过嵌入向量分析Olmo3训练语料库，检测与基准测试集的语义重复匹配，量化软污染程度。

Result: 1) 污染程度严重：CodeForces题目78%存在语义重复，ZebraLogic问题50%存在完全重复；2) 包含语义重复数据可提升基准性能；3) 在重复数据上微调能提升同一基准保留集性能。

Conclusion: 近期基准性能提升部分源于训练数据中累积的测试数据，而非纯粹能力提升，这混淆了对模型真实泛化能力的评估，需重新审视基准测试的有效性。

Abstract: If LLM training data is polluted with benchmark test data, then benchmark performance gives biased estimates of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Typical decontamination filters use n-gram matching which fail to detect semantic duplicates: sentences with equivalent (or near-equivalent) content that are not close in string space. We study this soft contamination of training data by semantic duplicates. Among other experiments, we embed the Olmo3 training corpus and find that: 1) contamination remains widespread, e.g. we find semantic duplicates for 78% of CodeForces and exact duplicates for 50% of ZebraLogic problems; 2) including semantic duplicates of benchmark data in training does improve benchmark performance; and 3) when finetuning on duplicates of benchmark datapoints, performance also improves on truly-held-out datapoints from the same benchmark. We argue that recent benchmark gains are thus confounded: the prevalence of soft contamination means gains reflect both genuine capability improvements and the accumulation of test data and effective test data in growing training corpora.

Conclusion: Spectron解决了原生低秩训练的核心稳定性问题，为高效训练大模型提供了新范式，其缩放律证明低秩模型具备理论上的计算效率优势

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success, yet their growing parameter counts pose significant computational and memory challenges. Low-rank factorization offers a promising route to reduce training and inference costs, but the community lacks a stable recipe for training models from scratch using exclusively low-rank weights while matching the performance of the dense model. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be trained from scratch using exclusively low-rank factorized weights for all non-embedding matrices without auxiliary "full-rank" guidance required by prior methods. While native low-rank training often suffers from instability and loss spikes, we identify uncontrolled growth in the spectral norm (largest singular value) of the weight matrix update as the dominant factor. To address this, we introduce Spectron: Spectral renormalization with orthogonalization, which dynamically bounds the resultant weight updates based on the current spectral norms of the factors. Our method enables stable, end-to-end factorized training with negligible overhead. Finally, we establish compute-optimal scaling laws for natively low-rank transformers, demonstrating predictable power-law behavior and improved inference efficiency relative to dense models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for optimal decision-making and control but often lacks provable guarantees for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel recovery-based shielding framework that enables safe RL with a provable safety lower bound for unknown and non-linear continuous dynamical systems. The proposed approach integrates a backup policy (shield) with the RL agent, leveraging Gaussian process (GP) based uncertainty quantification to predict potential violations of safety constraints, dynamically recovering to safe trajectories only when necessary. Experience gathered by the 'shielded' agent is used to construct the GP models, with policy optimization via internal model-based sampling - enabling unrestricted exploration and sample efficient learning, without compromising safety. Empirically our approach demonstrates strong performance and strict safety-compliance on a suite of continuous control environments.

Motivation: 深度集成方法存在三个实际限制：基模型间的冗余性导致计算成本膨胀并降低条件数稳定性；多共线性下的权重分配不稳定；以及元学习管道中的过拟合问题。

Conclusion: 正则化元学习是解决高维集成系统部署问题的一种稳定且高效的堆叠策略。

Abstract: Deep ensemble methods often improve predictive performance, yet they suffer from three practical limitations: redundancy among base models that inflates computational cost and degrades conditioning, unstable weighting under multicollinearity, and overfitting in meta-learning pipelines. We propose a regularized meta-learning framework that addresses these challenges through a four-stage pipeline combining redundancy-aware projection, statistical meta-feature augmentation, and cross-validated regularized meta-models (Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet). Our multi-metric de-duplication strategy removes near-collinear predictors using correlation and MSE thresholds ($τ_{\text{corr}}=0.95$), reducing the effective condition number of the meta-design matrix while preserving predictive diversity. Engineered ensemble statistics and interaction terms recover higher-order structure unavailable to raw prediction columns. A final inverse-RMSE blending stage mitigates regularizer-selection variance. On the Playground Series S6E1 benchmark (100K samples, 72 base models), the proposed framework achieves an out-of-fold RMSE of 8.582, improving over simple averaging (8.894) and conventional Ridge stacking (8.627), while matching greedy hill climbing (8.603) with substantially lower runtime (4 times faster). Conditioning analysis shows a 53.7\% reduction in effective matrix condition number after redundancy projection. Comprehensive ablations demonstrate consistent contributions from de-duplication, statistical meta-features, and meta-ensemble blending. These results position regularized meta-learning as a stable and deployment-efficient stacking strategy for high-dimensional ensemble systems.

Conclusion: Conditional LM generation establishes a scalable, task-agnostic alternative to per-instance optimization for RNA design.

Abstract: RNA design, the task of finding a sequence that folds into a target secondary structure, has broad biological and biomedical impact but remains computationally challenging due to the exponentially large sequence space and exponentially many competing folds. Traditional approaches treat it as an optimization problem, relying on per-instance heuristics or constraint-based search. We instead reframe RNA design as conditional sequence generation and introduce a reusable neural approximator, instantiated as an autoregressive language model (LM), that maps target structures directly to sequences. We first train our model in a supervised setting on random-induced structure-sequence pairs, and then use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize end-to-end metrics. We also propose methods to select a small subset for RL that greatly improves RL efficiency and quality. Across four datasets, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems on key metrics such as Boltzmann probability while being 1.7x faster, establishing conditional LM generation as a scalable, task-agnostic alternative to per-instance optimization for RNA design.

### [44] [Tight Bounds for Logistic Regression with Large Stepsize Gradient Descent in Low Dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12471)

TL;DR: 针对可分数据的二维线性模型逻辑损失优化问题，本研究通过精细分析梯度下降在最大间隔分类器正交子空间中的振荡动力学，收紧了过渡时间τ的界，证明当T ≥ Ω(n/γ + 1/γ²)时，梯度下降可获得O(1/(ηT))的超额损失界，并给出τ的匹配下界，表明分析是紧的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在大步长梯度下降训练可分数据时展示了1/T²加速率，但未充分刻画损失非单调阶段的动态特性，尤其缺乏低维场景下过渡过程τ的紧分析，限制了对算法收敛机制的深入理解。

Result: 1) 证明当迭代次数T ≥ Ω(n/γ + 1/γ²)时，梯度下降可获得低于O(1/(ηT))的损失；2) 给出τ的匹配上下界（仅差对数因子），证实分析的最优性。

Conclusion: 本研究通过揭示二维场景下梯度下降的振荡动力学机制，提供了逻辑损失优化更紧的收敛分析，明确了过渡时间τ的关键作用，为理解大步长梯度下降的非单调收敛行为提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: We consider the optimization problem of minimizing the logistic loss with gradient descent to train a linear model for binary classification with separable data. With a budget of $T$ iterations, it was recently shown that an accelerated $1/T^2$ rate is possible by choosing a large step size $η= Θ(γ^2 T)$ (where $γ$ is the dataset's margin) despite the resulting non-monotonicity of the loss. In this paper, we provide a tighter analysis of gradient descent for this problem when the data is two-dimensional: we show that GD with a sufficiently large learning rate $η$ finds a point with loss smaller than $\mathcal{O}(1/(ηT))$, as long as $T \geq Ω(n/γ+ 1/γ^2)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Our improved rate comes from a tighter bound on the time $τ$ that it takes for GD to transition from unstable (non-monotonic loss) to stable (monotonic loss), via a fine-grained analysis of the oscillatory dynamics of GD in the subspace orthogonal to the max-margin classifier. We also provide a lower bound of $τ$ matching our upper bound up to logarithmic factors, showing that our analysis is tight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将强化学习微调技术从大语言模型扩展到视觉语言模型时，发现RL调优后的VLM存在视觉 grounding 弱、幻觉、过度依赖文本线索等脆弱性，亟需系统性分析其局限性

Method: 通过受控文本扰动实验（误导性标题/错误推理链）测试模型鲁棒性，结合熵值分析量化模型不确定性变化，并深入探究RL微调动态过程与对抗增强策略

Result: 1) 文本扰动导致模型鲁棒性显著下降，且开源多模态模型受推理链一致性影响更明显

Conclusion: 单纯依赖准确率评估存在严重缺陷，未来需建立同时强调答案正确性、上下文鲁棒性及视觉推理忠实性的训练与评估新范式，以解决VLM的脆弱性问题

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning has become a key technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks, motivating its extension to vision language models (VLMs). While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbations--misleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) traces--cause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing model-specific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating a faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of accuracy-only evaluations and motivate training and assessment protocols that jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and the faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning.

Abstract: The intersection of Mean Field Games (MFGs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has fostered a growing family of algorithms designed to solve large-scale multi-agent systems. However, the field currently lacks a standardized evaluation protocol, forcing researchers to rely on bespoke, isolated, and often simplistic environments. This fragmentation makes it difficult to assess the robustness, generalization, and failure modes of emerging methods. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite for MFGs (Bench-MFG), focusing on the discrete-time, discrete-space, stationary setting for the sake of clarity. We introduce a taxonomy of problem classes, ranging from no-interaction and monotone games to potential and dynamics-coupled games, and provide prototypical environments for each. Furthermore, we propose MF-Garnets, a method for generating random MFG instances to facilitate rigorous statistical testing. We benchmark a variety of learning algorithms across these environments, including a novel black-box approach (MF-PSO) for exploitability minimization. Based on our extensive empirical results, we propose guidelines to standardize future experimental comparisons.

Motivation: 现有思维链(CoT)推理方法存在过度思考问题：长推理链虽提升答案质量但带来高推理成本和冗余步骤，现有启发式方法存在准确率下降和参数敏感问题

Method: 提出约束修正训练(CRT)框架：1) 采用参考保护的约束优化方法，交替最小化推理长度并在性能低于参考时修正准确率；2) 两阶段训练方案：先发现最短可靠推理模式，再在学到的长度预算下精炼准确率

Result: 1) 持续减少token使用同时保持答案质量；2) 通过缩短响应和减少内部语言冗余提升推理效率；3) 产生一系列保持正确性的中间检查点，实现无需重训的细粒度推理控制

Conclusion: CRT为高效推理提供了稳定且可解释的解决方案，不仅优化了推理长度，还降低了内部冗余，并实现了推理详细程度的灵活控制

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially when combined with reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training methods. While longer reasoning traces can improve answer quality and unlock abilities such as self-correction, they also incur high inference costs and often introduce redundant steps, known as overthinking. Recent research seeks to develop efficient reasoning strategies that balance reasoning length and accuracy, either through length-aware reward design or prompt-based calibration. However, these heuristic-based approaches may suffer from severe accuracy drop and be very sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these problems, we introduce CRT (Constraint-Rectified Training), a principled post-training framework based on reference-guarded constrained optimization, yielding a more stable and interpretable formulation for efficient reasoning. CRT alternates between minimizing reasoning length and rectifying accuracy only when performance falls below the reference, enabling stable and effective pruning of redundant reasoning. We further extend CRT with a two-stage training scheme that first discovers the shortest reliable reasoning patterns and then refines accuracy under a learnt length budget, preventing the re-emergence of verbose CoT. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that this framework consistently reduces token usage while maintaining answer quality at a robust and reliable level. Further analysis reveals that CRT improves reasoning efficiency not only by shortening responses but also by reducing internal language redundancy, leading to a new evaluation metric. Moreover, CRT-based training naturally yields a sequence of intermediate checkpoints that span a spectrum of explanation lengths while preserving correctness, enabling fine-grained control over reasoning verbosity without retraining.

TL;DR: This paper extends Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) beyond Dirichlet-multinomial models by deriving closed-form expressions for Gamma-Poisson and Normal-Gamma-Normal conjugate pairs, enabling flexible Bayesian nonparametric modeling for count and continuous data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HDP applications are predominantly limited to Dirichlet-multinomial conjugate structures, which restricts the framework's generality. The paper aims to systematically explore broader conjugate prior-likelihood pairs, particularly exponential family distributions, to make HDP more widely applicable for modeling various data types.

Method: Analytical derivation of two exponential family distributions (Poisson and normal) within HDP framework, providing detailed mathematical proofs and explicit closed-form expressions for their conjugate pairs (Gamma-Poisson and Normal-Gamma-Normal) under hierarchical construction.

Result: Derives explicit closed-form expressions for Gamma-Poisson and Normal-Gamma-Normal conjugate pairs in HDP, demonstrating systematic exploitation of conjugacy in hierarchical nonparametric models.

Conclusion: Extends HDP applicability beyond Dirichlet-multinomial setting, providing practical analytic tools for researchers employing hierarchical Bayesian nonparametrics for grouped data analysis.

Abstract: The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) provides a flexible Bayesian nonparametric framework for modeling grouped data with a shared yet unbounded collection of mixture components. While existing applications of the HDP predominantly focus on the Dirichlet-multinomial conjugate structure, the framework itself is considerably more general and, in principle, accommodates a broad class of conjugate prior-likelihood pairs. In particular, exponential family distributions offer a unified and analytically tractable modeling paradigm that encompasses many commonly used distributions. In this paper, we investigate analytic results for two important members of the exponential family within the HDP framework: the Poisson distribution and the normal distribution. We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the corresponding Gamma-Poisson and Normal-Gamma-Normal conjugate pairs under the hierarchical Dirichlet process construction. Detailed derivations and proofs are provided to clarify the underlying mathematical structure and to demonstrate how conjugacy can be systematically exploited in hierarchical nonparametric models. Our work extends the applicability of the HDP beyond the Dirichlet-multinomial setting and furnishes practical analytic results for researchers employing hierarchical Bayesian nonparametrics.

Conclusion: 该方法通过差异化实例级 steering 策略，解决了多模态大语言模型的模态偏好问题，在维持推理性能的同时实现更精准的模态平衡控制。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often exhibit significant modality preference, which is a tendency to favor one modality over another. Depending on the input, they may over-rely on linguistic priors relative to visual evidence, or conversely over-attend to visually salient but facts in textual contexts. Prior work has applied a uniform steering intensity to adjust the modality preference of MLLMs. However, strong steering can impair standard inference and increase error rates, whereas weak steering is often ineffective. In addition, because steering sensitivity varies substantially across multimodal instances, a single global strength is difficult to calibrate. To address this limitation with minimal disruption to inference, we introduce an instance-aware diagnostic metric that quantifies each modality's information contribution and reveals sample-specific susceptibility to steering. Building on these insights, we propose a scaling strategy that reduces steering for sensitive samples and a learnable module that infers scaling patterns, enabling instance-aware control of modality preference. Experimental results show that our instance-aware steering outperforms conventional steering in modulating modality preference, achieving effective adjustment while keeping generation error rates low.

Conclusion: ExtraCare通过解耦表征实现了性能与透明度的双重提升，为临床领域自适应提供了一种可解释的解决方案，有助于在临床实践中建立信任。

Abstract: Deep learning models for clinical event prediction on electronic health records (EHR) often suffer performance degradation when deployed under different data distributions. While domain adaptation (DA) methods can mitigate such shifts, its "black-box" nature prevents widespread adoption in clinical practice where transparency is essential for trust and safety. We propose ExtraCare to decompose patient representations into invariant and covariant components. By supervising these two components and enforcing their orthogonality during training, our model preserves label information while exposing domain-specific variation at the same time for more accurate predictions than most feature alignment models. More importantly, it offers human-understandable explanations by mapping sparse latent dimensions to medical concepts and quantifying their contributions via targeted ablations. ExtraCare is evaluated on two real-world EHR datasets across multiple domain partition settings, demonstrating superior performance along with enhanced transparency, as evidenced by its accurate predictions and explanations from extensive case studies.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale Large Language Models via expert specialization induced by conditional computation. In practice, however, expert specialization often fails: some experts become functionally similar, while others functioning as de facto shared experts, limiting the effective capacity and model performance. In this work, we analysis from a spectral perspective on parameter and gradient spaces, uncover that (1) experts share highly overlapping dominant spectral components in their parameters, (2) dominant gradient subspaces are strongly aligned across experts, driven by ubiquitous low-rank structure in human corpus, and (3) gating mechanisms preferentially route inputs along these dominant directions, further limiting specialization. To address this, we propose Spectral-Decoupled MoE (SD-MoE), which decomposes both parameter and gradient in the spectral space. SD-MoE improves performance across downstream tasks, enables effective expert specialization, incurring minimal additional computation, and can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing MoE architectures, including Qwen and DeepSeek.

Conclusion: 该方法以轻量级、模块化的方式有效解决了电动汽车联邦学习的不稳定性问题。

Abstract: Federated learning on connected electric vehicles (BEVs) faces severe instability due to intermittent connectivity, time-varying client participation, and pronounced client-to-client variation induced by diverse operating conditions. Conventional FedAvg and many advanced methods can suffer from excessive drift and degraded convergence under these realistic constraints. This work introduces Fractional-Order Roughness-Informed Federated Averaging (FO-RI-FedAvg), a lightweight and modular extension of FedAvg that improves stability through two complementary client-side mechanisms: (i) adaptive roughness-informed proximal regularization, which dynamically tunes the pull toward the global model based on local loss-landscape roughness, and (ii) non-integer-order local optimization, which incorporates short-term memory to smooth conflicting update directions. The approach preserves standard FedAvg server aggregation, adds only element-wise operations with amortizable overhead, and allows independent toggling of each component. Experiments on two real-world BEV energy prediction datasets, VED and its extended version eVED, show that FO-RI-FedAvg achieves improved accuracy and more stable convergence compared to strong federated baselines, particularly under reduced client participation.

Conclusion: VI-CuRL是一种有效的验证者无关强化学习框架，通过利用模型内在置信度构建课程成功解决了梯度方差问题，为可扩展的LLM推理训练提供了新方案

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning, yet its reliance on external verifiers limits its scalability. Recent findings suggest that RLVR primarily functions by eliciting latent capabilities, motivating the development of verifier-free algorithms. However, in such settings, standard methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization face a critical challenge: destructive gradient variance that often leads to training collapse. To address this issue, we introduceVerifier-Independent Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (VI-CuRL), a framework that leverages the model's intrinsic confidence to construct a curriculum independent from external verifiers. By prioritizing high-confidence samples, VI-CuRL effectively manages the bias-variance trade-off, specifically targeting the reduction of action and problem variance. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that our estimator guarantees asymptotic unbiasedness. Empirically, VI-CuRL promotes stability and consistently outperforms verifier-independent baselines across six challenging benchmarks with/without verifiers.

TL;DR: MoE Transformers forget in continual learning due to pre-routing feature collisions from multi-head attention; proposed head-wise routing (MH-MoE) reduces composition collisions and cuts forgetting by 6.7% BWT


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE architectures should theoretically excel at continual learning via sparse routing, but real-world MoE Transformers still suffer severe forgetting despite balanced expert usage, indicating an unresolved bottleneck in routing mechanisms

Method: Identified a pre-routing bottleneck where multi-head attention merges head-specific features into a single router input, causing routing collisions; quantified this via route-wise effective composition number (N_eff); proposed MH-MoE to enable head-wise routing over sub-representations for finer granularity

Result: Higher N_eff correlates strongly with increased old-task forgetting; MH-MoE reduces backward transfer (BWT) on Qwen3-0.6B from 11.2% (LoRAMoE baseline) to 4.5%, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting

Conclusion: Routing granularity is critical for MoE continual learning; head-wise routing resolves feature composition collisions in standard post-attention routing, enabling more stable parameter updates and significantly improved retention

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are often considered a natural fit for continual learning because sparse routing should localize updates and reduce interference, yet MoE Transformers still forget substantially even with sparse, well-balanced expert utilization. We attribute this gap to a pre-routing bottleneck: multi-head attention concatenates head-specific signals into a single post-attention router input, forcing routing to act on co-occurring feature compositions rather than separable head channels. We show that this router input simultaneously encodes multiple separately decodable semantic and structural factors with uneven head support, and that different feature compositions induce weakly aligned parameter-gradient directions; as a result, routing maps many distinct compositions to the same route. We quantify this collision effect via a route-wise effective composition number $N_{eff}$ and find that higher $N_{eff}$ is associated with larger old-task loss increases after continual training. Motivated by these findings, we propose MH-MoE, which performs head-wise routing over sub-representations to increase routing granularity and reduce composition collisions. On TRACE with Qwen3-0.6B/8B, MH-MoE effectively mitigates forgetting, reducing BWT on Qwen3-0.6B from 11.2% (LoRAMoE) to 4.5%.

TL;DR: Proposes a DFOS-based method detecting single-lane traffic abnormalities by tracking vehicle paths and spectral centroid changes in vibrations, achieving 80% accuracy with real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) systems effectively monitor wide-area traffic congestion but fail to detect single-lane abnormalities that trigger congestion, requiring new methods to identify lane-change behaviors indicative of localized issues.

Method: Estimates vehicle positions via clustering techniques, tracks paths along road sections, and detects lane changes by monitoring shifts in spectral centroid of vehicle vibrations using a reference vehicle.

Result: Real traffic data evaluation shows 80% accuracy in detecting lane change events that signal single-lane abnormalities.

Conclusion: The method successfully identifies single-lane abnormalities through vehicle lane-change detection, addressing a critical gap in DFOS-based traffic monitoring for localized congestion prevention.

Abstract: The distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) system is a cost-effective wide-area traffic monitoring technology that utilizes existing fiber infrastructure to effectively detect traffic congestions. However, detecting single-lane abnormalities, that lead to congestions, is still a challenge. These single-lane abnormalities can be detected by monitoring lane change behaviour of vehicles, performed to avoid congestion along the monitoring section of a road. This paper presents a method to detect single-lane abnormalities by tracking individual vehicle paths and detecting vehicle lane changes along a section of a road. We propose a method to estimate the vehicle position at all time instances and fit a path using clustering techniques. We detect vehicle lane change by monitoring any change in spectral centroid of vehicle vibrations by tracking a reference vehicle along a highway. The evaluation of our proposed method with real traffic data showed 80% accuracy for lane change detection events that represent presence of abnormalities.

TL;DR: 该论文将自注意力机制重新理解为动态两层MLP，提出HyperMLP/HyperGLU方法，通过特征与序列空间中的动态混合以及逆向偏移布局，在匹配参数量下持续优于标准softmax注意力。

Motivation: 当前自注意力机制被视为概率性查询-键查找，导致设计复杂且限制创新。作者倡导从动态MLP角度统一理解注意力机制，认为这种视角能揭示注意力本质并催生更灵活的架构。

Method: 提出HyperMLP和HyperGLU两种架构，将自注意力建模为动态两层MLP，权重由上下文历史实例化。采用逆向偏移（lag）布局实现时间混合与自回归语义的对齐，在特征空间和序列空间学习动态混合。

Result: 理论层面证明了该架构的表达能力；实验层面显示，在参数量匹配的条件下，HyperMLP/HyperGLU能持续优于强大的softmax注意力基线模型。

Conclusion: 动态MLP视角为自注意力机制提供了更统一、简洁的理解框架，所提方法在性能和效率上均验证了其有效性，为注意力机制设计开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Self-attention is often viewed as probabilistic query-key lookup, motivating designs that preserve normalized attention scores and fixed positional semantics. We advocate a simpler and more unified perspective: an autoregressive attention head can be viewed as a dynamic two-layer MLP whose weights are instantiated from the context history. From this view, attention scores form an ever-growing hidden representation, and standard MLP activations such as ReLU or GLU naturally implement input-conditioned selection over a context-dependent memory pool rather than a probability distribution. Based on this formulation, we introduce HyperMLP and HyperGLU, which learn dynamic mixing in both feature space and sequence space, using a reverse-offset (lag) layout to align temporal mixing with autoregressive semantics. We provide theoretical characterizations of the expressivity and implications of this structure, and empirically show that HyperMLP/HyperGLU consistently outperform strong softmax-attention baselines under matched parameter budgets.

### [59] [Unifying Model-Free Efficiency and Model-Based Representations via Latent Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12643)
*Jashaswimalya Acharjee,Balaraman Ravindran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified Latent Dynamics (ULD) is a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that bridges model-free efficiency and model-based representational power by embedding state-action pairs into a latent space where the value function is approximately linear, achieving strong cross-domain performance on 80 environments with minimal hyperparameter tuning and fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the fundamental trade-off in reinforcement learning between model-free methods (sample-efficient but limited representation) and model-based approaches (strong representation but burdened by planning overhead), seeking a unified solution that works across diverse domains from continuous control to high-dimensional Atari games with consistent hyperparameters.

Method: ULD embeds state-action pairs into a latent space where the true value function is approximately linear. It uses synchronized updates of encoder, value, and policy networks, incorporates auxiliary losses for short-horizon predictive dynamics, and applies reward-scale normalization. Theoretically, the method proves that under mild conditions, the fixed point of embedding-based temporal-difference updates matches that of a corresponding linear model-based value expansion, with explicit error bounds linking embedding fidelity to value approximation quality.

Result: Evaluated on 80 environments spanning Gym locomotion, DeepMind Control (proprioceptive and visual), and Atari, ULD matches or exceeds the performance of specialized model-free and general model-based baselines. The approach achieves cross-domain competence with a single set of hyperparameters and uses only a fraction of the parameter footprint compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that value-aligned latent representations alone can deliver the adaptability and sample efficiency traditionally attributed to full model-based planning, suggesting a new paradigm where latent dynamics unification can replace explicit planning while maintaining performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: We present Unified Latent Dynamics (ULD), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that unifies the efficiency of model-free methods with the representational strengths of model-based approaches, without incurring planning overhead. By embedding state-action pairs into a latent space in which the true value function is approximately linear, our method supports a single set of hyperparameters across diverse domains -- from continuous control with low-dimensional and pixel inputs to high-dimensional Atari games. We prove that, under mild conditions, the fixed point of our embedding-based temporal-difference updates coincides with that of a corresponding linear model-based value expansion, and we derive explicit error bounds relating embedding fidelity to value approximation quality. In practice, ULD employs synchronized updates of encoder, value, and policy networks, auxiliary losses for short-horizon predictive dynamics, and reward-scale normalization to ensure stable learning under sparse rewards. Evaluated on 80 environments spanning Gym locomotion, DeepMind Control (proprioceptive and visual), and Atari, our approach matches or exceeds the performance of specialized model-free and general model-based baselines -- achieving cross-domain competence with minimal tuning and a fraction of the parameter footprint. These results indicate that value-aligned latent representations alone can deliver the adaptability and sample efficiency traditionally attributed to full model-based planning.

### [60] [Block-Sample MAC-Bayes Generalization Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12605)
*Matthias Frey,Jingge Zhu,Michael C. Gastpar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces novel block-sample MAC-Bayes bounds that improve generalization error estimation by using data subsets ("blocks"), offering tighter bounds than traditional PAC-Bayes methods, while proving inherent limitations in converting these to high-probability guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PAC-Bayes bounds often yield vacuous (infinite) results or lack tightness in expected generalization error estimation. The authors aim to develop more practical and tighter bounds by leveraging partial data dependencies instead of full-dataset dependencies.

Method: Proposes a generalized family of MAC-Bayes (mean approximately correct) bounds that replace full-data divergence terms with block-level divergences computed over subsets of training data. This approach adapts expectation-based PAC-Bayes frameworks but structures divergences around data blocks rather than entire datasets.

Result: 1) Demonstrates a numerical example where standard PAC-Bayes bounds are vacuous (infinite) for all priors, while block-sample MAC-Bayes bounds remain finite with optimal block sizing. 2) Proves a negative result: high-probability PAC-Bayes versions of these bounds cannot simultaneously achieve O(n^{-1/2}) vanishing rates and logarithmic error-probability dependence. Any converted bound either vanishes slower (O(1/log n)) or loses tightness in error probability scaling.

Conclusion: Block-sample MAC-Bayes bounds provide a theoretically grounded path to tighter expected generalization error estimates, but fundamental trade-offs prevent direct conversion to high-probability guarantees without sacrificing convergence rates or error scaling. This establishes a new paradigm for expectation-based generalization bounds with practical advantages over traditional methods, albeit with inherent theoretical limits.

Abstract: We present a family of novel block-sample MAC-Bayes bounds (mean approximately correct). While PAC-Bayes bounds (probably approximately correct) typically give bounds for the generalization error that hold with high probability, MAC-Bayes bounds have a similar form but bound the expected generalization error instead. The family of bounds we propose can be understood as a generalization of an expectation version of known PAC-Bayes bounds. Compared to standard PAC-Bayes bounds, the new bounds contain divergence terms that only depend on subsets (or \emph{blocks}) of the training data. The proposed MAC-Bayes bounds hold the promise of significantly improving upon the tightness of traditional PAC-Bayes and MAC-Bayes bounds. This is illustrated with a simple numerical example in which the original PAC-Bayes bound is vacuous regardless of the choice of prior, while the proposed family of bounds are finite for appropriate choices of the block size. We also explore the question whether high-probability versions of our MAC-Bayes bounds (i.e., PAC-Bayes bounds of a similar form) are possible. We answer this question in the negative with an example that shows that in general, it is not possible to establish a PAC-Bayes bound which (a) vanishes with a rate faster than $\mathcal{O}(1/\log n)$ whenever the proposed MAC-Bayes bound vanishes with rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ and (b) exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the permitted error probability.

Abstract: Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) combines sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models and has shown strong performance in video generation. However, (i) SLA relies on a heuristic split that assigns computations to the sparse or linear branch based on attention-weight magnitude, which can be suboptimal. Additionally, (ii) after formally analyzing the attention error in SLA, we identify a mismatch between SLA and a direct decomposition into sparse and linear attention. We propose SLA2, which introduces (I) a learnable router that dynamically selects whether each attention computation should use sparse or linear attention, (II) a more faithful and direct sparse-linear attention formulation that uses a learnable ratio to combine the sparse and linear attention branches, and (III) a sparse + low-bit attention design, where low-bit attention is introduced via quantization-aware fine-tuning to reduce quantization error. Experiments show that on video diffusion models, SLA2 can achieve 97% attention sparsity and deliver an 18.6x attention speedup while preserving generation quality.

Abstract: Relational deep learning (RDL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning directly on relational databases by modeling entities and their relationships across multiple interconnected tables. As this paradigm evolves toward larger models and relational foundation models, scalable and realistic benchmarks are essential for enabling systematic evaluation and progress. In this paper, we introduce RelBench v2, a major expansion of the RelBench benchmark for RDL. RelBench v2 adds four large-scale relational datasets spanning scholarly publications, enterprise resource planning, consumer platforms, and clinical records, increasing the benchmark to 11 datasets comprising over 22 million rows across 29 tables. We further introduce autocomplete tasks, a new class of predictive objectives that require models to infer missing attribute values directly within relational tables while respecting temporal constraints, expanding beyond traditional forecasting tasks constructed via SQL queries. In addition, RelBench v2 expands beyond its native datasets by integrating external benchmarks and evaluation frameworks: we translate event streams from the Temporal Graph Benchmark into relational schemas for unified relational-temporal evaluation, interface with ReDeLEx to provide uniform access to 70+ real-world databases suitable for pretraining, and incorporate 4DBInfer datasets and tasks to broaden multi-table prediction coverage. Experimental results demonstrate that RDL models consistently outperform single-table baselines across autocomplete, forecasting, and recommendation tasks, highlighting the importance of modeling relational structure explicitly.

Conclusion: 该方法通过解决教师过度自信问题，实现了"暗知识"的更可靠传递，提升了学生模型的实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The core of knowledge distillation lies in transferring the teacher's rich 'dark knowledge'-subtle probabilistic patterns that reveal how classes are related and the distribution of uncertainties. While this idea is well established, teachers trained with conventional cross-entropy often fail to preserve such signals. Their distributions collapse into sharp, overconfident peaks that appear decisive but are in fact brittle, offering little beyond the hard label or subtly hindering representation-level transfer. This overconfidence is especially problematic in high-cardinality tasks, where the nuances among many plausible classes matter most for guiding a compact student. Moreover, such brittle targets reduce robustness under distribution shift, leaving students vulnerable to miscalibration in real-world conditions. To address this limitation, we revisit distillation from a distributional perspective and propose Calibrated Uncertainty Distillation (CUD), a framework designed to make dark knowledge more faithfully accessible. Instead of uncritically adopting the teacher's overconfidence, CUD encourages teachers to reveal uncertainty where it is informative and guides students to learn from targets that are calibrated rather than sharpened certainty. By directly shaping the teacher's predictive distribution before transfer, our approach balances accuracy and calibration, allowing students to benefit from both confident signals on easy cases and structured uncertainty on hard ones. Across diverse benchmarks, CUD yields students that are not only more accurate, but also more calibrated under shift and more reliable on ambiguous, long-tail inputs.

Motivation: Existing TGNNs only handle one-time predictions, but real-world applications require continuous predictions. Direct adaptation leads to high computational costs or poor prediction quality, especially for large graphs.

Method: Coden is a novel TGNN model that addresses the key complexity bottleneck in existing TGNNs. It provides theoretical analyses showing its effectiveness, efficiency, and duality relationships with RNN-based and attention-based models.

Conclusion: Coden establishes itself as a superior solution for continuous prediction in evolving graph environments by efficiently handling the computational challenges while maintaining high predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are pivotal in processing dynamic graphs. However, existing TGNNs primarily target one-time predictions for a given temporal span, whereas many practical applications require continuous predictions, that predictions are issued frequently over time. Directly adapting existing TGNNs to continuous-prediction scenarios introduces either significant computational overhead or prediction quality issues especially for large graphs. This paper revisits the challenge of { continuous predictions} in TGNNs, and introduces {\sc Coden}, a TGNN model designed for efficient and effective learning on dynamic graphs. {\sc Coden} innovatively overcomes the key complexity bottleneck in existing TGNNs while preserving comparable predictive accuracy. Moreover, we further provide theoretical analyses that substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of {\sc Coden}, and clarify its duality relationship with both RNN-based and attention-based models. Our evaluations across five dynamic datasets show that {\sc Coden} surpasses existing performance benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness, establishing it as a superior solution for continuous prediction in evolving graph environments.

Abstract: Predicting future clinical events from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) is challenging due to sparse multi-type clinical events, hierarchical medical vocabularies, and the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to hallucinate when reasoning over long structured histories. We study next-visit event prediction, which aims to forecast a patient's upcoming clinical events based on prior visits. We propose GRAIL, a framework that models longitudinal EHRs using structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval. GRAIL constructs a unified clinical graph by combining deterministic coding-system hierarchies with data-driven temporal associations across event types, embeds this graph in hyperbolic space, and summarizes each visit as a probabilistic Central Event that denoises sparse observations. At inference time, GRAIL retrieves a structured set of clinically plausible future events aligned with hierarchical and temporal progression, and optionally refines their ranking using an LLM as a constrained inference-time reranker. Experiments on MIMIC-IV show that GRAIL consistently improves multi-type next-visit prediction and yields more hierarchy-consistent forecasts.

Conclusion: SDM通过将数值求解器与扩散轨迹内在特性对齐，为高效扩散采样提供了原则性、免训练的方法，显著降低计算成本同时保证采样过程忠实于连续动力学。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable performance across various domains, yet their practical deployment is often limited by high sampling costs. While prior work focuses on training objectives or individual solvers, the holistic design of sampling, specifically solver selection and scheduling, remains dominated by static heuristics. In this work, we revisit this challenge through a geometric lens, proposing SDM, a principled framework that aligns the numerical solver with the intrinsic properties of the diffusion trajectory. By analyzing the ODE dynamics, we show that efficient low-order solvers suffice in early high-noise stages while higher-order solvers can be progressively deployed to handle the increasing non-linearity of later stages. Furthermore, we formalize the scheduling by introducing a Wasserstein-bounded optimization framework. This method systematically derives adaptive timesteps that explicitly bound the local discretization error, ensuring the sampling process remains faithful to the underlying continuous dynamics. Without requiring additional training or architectural modifications, SDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, including an FID of 1.93 on CIFAR-10, 2.41 on FFHQ, and 1.98 on AFHQv2, with a reduced number of function evaluations compared to existing samplers.

TL;DR: FLAC is a likelihood-free reinforcement learning framework that enables the use of expressive iterative generative policies (like diffusion models) by regulating policy stochasticity through kinetic energy penalization instead of explicit action densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iterative generative policies offer superior expressivity for continuous control but are incompatible with Maximum Entropy RL because their action log-densities cannot be directly computed, requiring a new theoretical and algorithmic approach.

Method: Formulates policy optimization as a Generalized Schrödinger Bridge problem relative to a high-entropy reference process, using kinetic energy of the velocity field as a proxy for divergence from the reference. Derives an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and practical off-policy algorithm with automatic kinetic energy tuning via a Lagrangian dual mechanism.

Result: Achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional continuous control benchmarks against strong baselines while avoiding explicit density estimation, demonstrating the effectiveness of kinetic energy regularization.

Conclusion: The framework provides a theoretically grounded and practical solution for leveraging expressive iterative generative policies in RL by replacing explicit density requirements with a physically motivated kinetic energy regularization that naturally embodies the maximum-entropy principle.

Abstract: Iterative generative policies, such as diffusion models and flow matching, offer superior expressivity for continuous control but complicate Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning because their action log-densities are not directly accessible. To address this, we propose Field Least-Energy Actor-Critic (FLAC), a likelihood-free framework that regulates policy stochasticity by penalizing the kinetic energy of the velocity field. Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schrödinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution. Building on this view, we derive an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and a practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes the kinetic energy via a Lagrangian dual mechanism. Empirically, FLAC achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional benchmarks relative to strong baselines, while avoiding explicit density estimation.

Abstract: Designing suitable rewards poses a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), especially for embodied manipulation. Trajectory success rewards are suitable for human judges or model fitting, but the sparsity severely limits RL sample efficiency. While recent methods have effectively improved RL via dense rewards, they rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data or abundant expert supervision. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG), a novel framework to seek sample-efficient dense rewards without requiring human annotations or extensive supervision. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large video generation models, DEG only needs a small number of expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance for each RL episode. Then, the proposed dual-granularity reward that balances coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching, will guide the agent to efficiently approximate the generated guidance video sequentially in the contrastive self-supervised latent space, and finally complete the target task. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse tasks across both simulation and real-world settings show that DEG can not only serve as an efficient exploration stimulus to help the agent quickly discover sparse success rewards, but also guide effective RL and stable policy convergence independently.

TL;DR: This paper identifies "Normalization Squeeze" in RLVR where rare but correct reasoning paths are suppressed to extinction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR aligns LLMs but systematically suppresses valid rare reasoning paths due to mode-seeking policy gradients and finite sampling, termed "Normalization Squeeze" where rare correct traces are driven to statistical extinction.

Method: Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS) decouples generation from verification, using a Flow Matching objective to repurpose the verifier for estimating probability flow conservation, enabling robust search in sparse, high-entropy spaces.

Result: ARTS achieves 74.6% on MATH-500 (BoN@16), matching fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone. On long-tail subsets where RL collapses to 0% pass@k, ARTS uniquely recovers significant performance.

Conclusion: Disentangling verification from generation provides a more robust pathway for complex reasoning tasks by preserving the base model's latent diversity while avoiding the collapse pathologies of coupled RL optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has established itself as the dominant paradigm for instilling rigorous reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models. While effective at amplifying dominant behaviors, we identify a critical pathology in this alignment process: the systematic suppression of valid but rare (low-likelihood under the base model distribution) reasoning paths. We theoretically characterize this phenomenon as a "Normalization Squeeze," where the interplay between mode-seeking policy gradients and finite sampling acts as a high-pass likelihood filter, driving the probability of rare correct traces to statistical extinction. To counteract this collapse without discarding the base model's latent diversity, we propose Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS). Unlike standard approaches that force internalization via parameter updates, ARTS prioritizes deliberation by decoupling generation from verification. We introduce a Flow Matching objective that repurposes the verifier to estimate the conservation of probability flow, enabling robust navigation through sparse, high-entropy search spaces where traditional discriminative objectives fail. Extensive experiments on the MATH-500 benchmark demonstrate that ARTS achieves a performance of 74.6% (BoN@16), effectively matching fully fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone. Crucially, on the long-tail subset where coupled RL optimization collapses to 0% pass@k, ARTS uniquely recovers significant performance, suggesting that disentangling verification from generation offers a more robust pathway for solving complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Cellular identity and function are linked to both their intrinsic genomic makeup and extrinsic spatial context within the tissue microenvironment. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) offers an unprecedented opportunity to study this, providing in situ gene expression profiles at single-cell resolution and illuminating the spatial and functional organization of cells within tissues. However, a significant hurdle remains: ST data is inherently noisy, large, and structurally complex. This complexity makes it intractable for existing computational methods to effectively capture the interplay between spatial interactions and intrinsic genomic relationships, thus limiting our ability to discern critical biological patterns. Here, we present CellScape, a deep learning framework designed to overcome these limitations for high-performance ST data analysis and pattern discovery. CellScape jointly models cellular interactions in tissue space and genomic relationships among cells, producing comprehensive representations that seamlessly integrate spatial signals with underlying gene regulatory mechanisms. This technique uncovers biologically informative patterns that improve spatial domain segmentation and supports comprehensive spatial cellular analyses across diverse transcriptomics datasets, offering an accurate and versatile framework for deep analysis and interpretation of ST data.w

*Zhan Qu,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-VORTEX是一种基于增强重叠理论的时空对比学习框架，用于从LiDAR点云序列中学习物理感知的尾涡表示，仅用1%的标注数据即可实现优越的尾涡中心定位和轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尾涡是航空安全的主要挑战，但现有方法将每次扫描视为独立监督分割问题，忽略了时间结构，且无法扩展到实际采集的大量未标注数据。LiDAR扫描稀疏、涡旋特征随时间衰减、逐点标注成本高昂是三大核心难题。

Method: 通过时空对比学习，从同一飞行事件构建弱扰动序列和强增强序列（时间下采样+空间掩码）的配对输入，利用时间分布式几何编码器提取单帧特征，用时序聚合器建模变长序列中涡旋的演化状态，对齐缺失帧和部分观测的表示。

Result: 在超过一百万条LiDAR扫描的真实数据集上，X-VORTEX仅使用监督基线1%的标注数据就实现了更优的涡旋中心定位性能，且学习到的表示支持准确的轨迹预测。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了传感器稀疏性和时变涡旋动力学挑战，为从海量未标注LiDAR数据中可扩展地跟踪复杂流体现象提供了新范式，显著降低了对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Wake vortices are strong, coherent air turbulences created by aircraft, and they pose a major safety and capacity challenge for air traffic management. Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans. X-VORTEX achieves superior vortex center localization while using only 1% of the labeled data required by supervised baselines, and the learned representations support accurate trajectory forecasting.

TL;DR: Theseus：一种无需训练的跨宽度模型任务更新迁移方法，通过匹配功能效应而非参数，实现异质模型间的任务向量传输


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应预训练模型产生的任务特定参数更新在不同模型变体间重新学习成本高昂，现有方法仅适用于相同架构模型，跨宽度迁移尚未被探索

Method: 将任务更新表征为对中间表示的功能效应，通过正交普氏分析对齐表征空间，以激活值上的功能匹配问题形式化任务向量传输，并给出保持更新几何结构的闭式解

Result: 在视觉和语言模型的跨宽度评估中，Theseus持续优于强基线方法，且无需额外训练或反向传播

Conclusion: 当从功能角度而非参数角度定义任务身份时，任务更新可在不同架构间实现有效迁移

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks often produces task-specific parameter updates that are expensive to relearn for every model variant. While recent work has shown that such updates can be transferred between models with identical architectures, transferring them across models of different widths remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Theseus, a training-free method for transporting task-specific updates across heterogeneous models. Rather than matching parameters directly, we characterize a task update by the functional effect it induces on intermediate representations. We formalize task-vector transport as a functional matching problem on observed activations and show that, after aligning representation spaces via orthogonal Procrustes analysis, it admits a stable closed-form solution that preserves the geometry of the update. We evaluate Theseus on vision and language models across different widths, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines without additional training or backpropagation. Our results show that task updates can be meaningfully transferred across architectures when task identity is defined functionally rather than parametrically.

*Kenji Fukumizu,Wei Huang,Han Bao,Shuntuo Xu,Nisha Chandramoothy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reformulates Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to derive an exact proximal formulation using an extended Brenier potential, removes the density assumption on target distributions, and proves terminal normal hyperbolicity for manifold-supported targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize OT-CFM by eliminating the restrictive assumption that the target distribution must have a density, and to understand its convergence properties and dynamical behavior for manifold-supported data.

Method: Extended Brenier potential theory to derive a proximal formulation, analyzed minibatch convergence limits, and applied second epi-derivatives of convex potentials to study terminal normal hyperbolicity.

Result: Obtained an explicit proximal expression for the vector field mapping, established convergence of minibatch OT-CFM to population formulation, and proved that OT-CFM exhibits exponential contraction normal to data manifolds with neutral tangential dynamics after time rescaling.

Conclusion: OT-CFM admits a general proximal formulation without density constraints and possesses favorable terminal dynamics (normal hyperbolicity) that explain its effectiveness for generative modeling on low-dimensional manifolds.

Abstract: We reformulate Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM), a class of dynamical generative models, showing that it admits an exact proximal formulation via an extended Brenier potential, without assuming that the target distribution has a density. In particular, the mapping to recover the target point is exactly given by a proximal operator, which yields an explicit proximal expression of the vector field. We also discuss the convergence of minibatch OT-CFM to the population formulation as the batch size increases. Finally, using second epi-derivatives of convex potentials, we prove that, for manifold-supported targets, OT-CFM is terminally normally hyperbolic: after time rescaling, the dynamics contracts exponentially in directions normal to the data manifold while remaining neutral along tangential directions.

### [74] [Extending confidence calibration to generalised measures of variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12975)
*Andrew Thompson,Vivek Desai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出Variation Calibration Error (VCE)指标，用于评估机器学习分类器的校准性。VCE扩展了传统的Expected Calibration Error (ECE)方法，从仅评估最大置信度的校准扩展到评估概率分布的任何变异度量（如熵）的校准。在合成数据实验中，VCE在样本量增加时能趋近于零，而现有熵基校准指标UCE则不具备此理想性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有校准指标如ECE仅评估分类器最大概率或置信度的校准性，未能充分利用完整的概率分布信息。虽然熵等变异度量可以考虑整个分布，但缺乏将ECE方法扩展到这些度量的系统方法，需要更全面的校准评估指标。

Method: 提出VCE指标，将ECE的评估框架从置信度校准泛化到任意变异度量校准。该方法通过分箱方式评估预测概率分布的各种统计特性（如熵）的校准程度，而非仅限于最大置信度。

Result: 在设计的完美校准合成预测实验中，随着样本量增加，VCE能够趋近于零，表现出期望的统计一致性。相比之下，文献中提出的UCE熵基校准指标未能展现这一理想性质。

Conclusion: VCE是一个更优的校准评估指标，它不仅考虑了完整的概率分布信息，还保持了ECE框架的直观解释性，并具备UCE所缺乏的统计一致性，能更准确地反映分类器的真实校准水平。

Abstract: We propose the Variation Calibration Error (VCE) metric for assessing the calibration of machine learning classifiers. The metric can be viewed as an extension of the well-known Expected Calibration Error (ECE) which assesses the calibration of the maximum probability or confidence. Other ways of measuring the variation of a probability distribution exist which have the advantage of taking into account the full probability distribution, for example the Shannon entropy. We show how the ECE approach can be extended from assessing confidence calibration to assessing the calibration of any metric of variation. We present numerical examples upon synthetic predictions which are perfectly calibrated by design, demonstrating that, in this scenario, the VCE has the desired property of approaching zero as the number of data samples increases, in contrast to another entropy-based calibration metric (the UCE) which has been proposed in the literature.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效应对非平稳环境下无标签流数据的异常检测挑战，概念漂移检测器的集成提升了模型在动态环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In today's digital world, the generation of vast amounts of streaming data in various domains has become ubiquitous. However, many of these data are unlabeled, making it challenging to identify events, particularly anomalies. This task becomes even more formidable in nonstationary environments where model performance can deteriorate over time due to concept drift. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel method, VAE++ESDD, which employs incremental learning and two-level ensembling: an ensemble of Variational AutoEncoder(VAEs) for anomaly prediction, along with an ensemble of concept drift detectors. Each drift detector utilizes a statistical-based concept drift mechanism. To evaluate the effectiveness of VAE++ESDD, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study using real-world and synthetic datasets characterized by severely or extremely low anomalous rates and various drift characteristics. Our study reveals that the proposed method significantly outperforms both strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出杠杆加权共形预测(LWCP)，通过统计杠杆加权非conformity分数，无需辅助模型即可实现自适应预测区间，保持有限样本有效性并改善条件覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分体共形预测产生固定宽度区间，在低方差区域过度覆盖而在高方差区域覆盖不足；现有自适应方法需要训练辅助模型，计算成本高。

Method: 利用设计矩阵几何结构，通过帽子矩阵对角线元素(统计杠杆)加权非conformity分数，可选择任意权重函数，支持随机杠杆近似，几乎无额外计算开销。

Result: 保持任意权重函数下的有限样本边际有效性；在异方差通过杠杆因子化时实现渐近最优条件覆盖；高斯假设下恢复经典区间形式与宽度；随机近似保持精确覆盖且宽度扰动可控；消除普通共形预测的样本量无关条件覆盖间隙；实验证实理论预测并显著减少条件覆盖差异。

Conclusion: LWCP是一种无需辅助模型、计算高效、具有强理论保证的自适应共形预测方法，在各种设置下都能有效改善条件覆盖性能。

Abstract: Split conformal prediction provides distribution-free prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal coverage, but produces constant-width intervals that overcover in low-variance regions and undercover in high-variance regions. Existing adaptive methods require training auxiliary models. We propose Leverage-Weighted Conformal Prediction (LWCP), which weights nonconformity scores by a function of the statistical leverage -- the diagonal of the hat matrix -- deriving adaptivity from the geometry of the design matrix rather than from auxiliary model fitting. We prove that LWCP preserves finite-sample marginal validity for any weight function; achieves asymptotically optimal conditional coverage at essentially no width cost when heteroscedasticity factors through leverage; and recovers the form and width of classical prediction intervals under Gaussian assumptions while retaining distribution-free guarantees. We further establish that randomized leverage approximations preserve coverage exactly with controlled width perturbation, and that vanilla CP suffers a persistent, sample-size-independent conditional coverage gap that LWCP eliminates. The method requires no hyperparameters beyond the choice of weight function and adds negligible computational overhead to vanilla CP. Experiments on synthetic and real data confirm the theoretical predictions, demonstrating substantial reductions in conditional coverage disparity across settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法易陷入伪方程陷阱（拟合数据但违背科学原理），因过度依赖经验风险最小化而缺乏科学一致性约束机制

Method: 构建三阶段（预热-进化-精炼）PG-SR框架：1) 编码领域先验为可执行约束程序；2) 在进化阶段采用先验退火约束评估(PACE)机制渐进引导搜索；3) 全流程嵌入先验约束检查器

Result: 理论证明降低假设空间的Rademacher复杂度并获得更紧的泛化界；实验显示在多样领域显著优于SOTA基线，对先验质量、噪声数据和稀疏数据具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: PG-SR通过显式嵌入科学先验约束，有效避免伪方程产生，为发现符合科学原理的可解释方程提供可靠框架

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) aims to discover interpretable equations from observational data, with the potential to reveal underlying principles behind natural phenomena. However, existing approaches often fall into the Pseudo-Equation Trap: producing equations that fit observations well but remain inconsistent with fundamental scientific principles. A key reason is that these approaches are dominated by empirical risk minimization, lacking explicit constraints to ensure scientific consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose PG-SR, a prior-guided SR framework built upon a three-stage pipeline consisting of warm-up, evolution, and refinement. Throughout the pipeline, PG-SR introduces a prior constraint checker that explicitly encodes domain priors as executable constraint programs, and employs a Prior Annealing Constrained Evaluation (PACE) mechanism during the evolution stage to progressively steer discovery toward scientifically consistent regions. Theoretically, we prove that PG-SR reduces the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space, yielding tighter generalization bounds and establishing a guarantee against pseudo-equations. Experimentally, PG-SR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, maintaining robustness to varying prior quality, noisy data, and data scarcity.

Conclusion: SWING为隐式图计算提供了新范式，通过连续空间采样和频域分析突破传统图遍历限制，兼具理论创新性与工程实用性，适用于大规模图机器学习场景。

Abstract: We propose SWING: Space Walks for Implicit Network Graphs, a new class of algorithms for computations involving Graph Random Features on graphs given by implicit representations (i-graphs), where edge-weights are defined as bi-variate functions of feature vectors in the corresponding nodes. Those classes of graphs include several prominent examples, such as: $ε$-neighborhood graphs, used on regular basis in machine learning. Rather than conducting walks on graphs' nodes, those methods rely on walks in continuous spaces, in which those graphs are embedded. To accurately and efficiently approximate original combinatorial calculations, SWING applies customized Gumbel-softmax sampling mechanism with linearized kernels, obtained via random features coupled with importance sampling techniques. This algorithm is of its own interest. SWING relies on the deep connection between implicitly defined graphs and Fourier analysis, presented in this paper. SWING is accelerator-friendly and does not require input graph materialization. We provide detailed analysis of SWING and complement it with thorough experiments on different classes of i-graphs.

Conclusion: 动态学习采样温度是有效的，能够提升LLM在需要推理的任务上的性能，并为模型探索行为提供了可解释性。该方法将解码策略从推理时选择转变为学习过程中的核心组件。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains large language models (LLMs) from sampled trajectories, making decoding strategy a core component of learning rather than a purely inference-time choice. Sampling temperature directly controls the exploration--exploitation trade-off by modulating policy entropy, yet existing methods rely on static values or heuristic adaptations that are decoupled from task-level rewards. We propose Introspective LLM, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that learns to control sampling temperature during generation. At each decoding step, the model selects a temperature based on its hidden state and samples the next token from the resulting distribution. Temperature and token policies are jointly optimized from downstream rewards using a coordinate ascent scheme. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that learned temperature policies outperform fixed and heuristic baselines, while exhibiting interpretable exploration behaviors aligned with reasoning uncertainty.

Conclusion: GMR利用局部几何先验有效处理不平衡数据，非对称策略平衡了清理与保护，提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Imbalanced classification presents a formidable challenge in machine learning, particularly when tabular datasets are plagued by noise and overlapping class boundaries. From a geometric perspective, the core difficulty lies in the topological intrusion of the majority class into the minority manifold, which obscures the true decision boundary. Traditional undersampling techniques, such as Edited Nearest Neighbours (ENN), typically employ symmetric cleaning rules and uniform voting, failing to capture the local manifold structure and often inadvertently removing informative minority samples. In this paper, we propose GMR (Geometric Manifold Rectification), a novel framework designed to robustly handle imbalanced structured data by exploiting local geometric priors. GMR makes two contributions: (1) Geometric confidence estimation that uses inverse-distance weighted kNN voting with an adaptive distance metric to capture local reliability; and (2) asymmetric cleaning that is strict on majority samples while conservatively protecting minority samples via a safe-guarding cap on minority removal. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that GMR is competitive with strong sampling baselines.

TL;DR: PILNO enhances Laplace Neural Operators by embedding physics-informed constraints, using virtual inputs for OOD robustness, and temporal-causality weighting for stable small-data PDE solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purely data-driven neural operators require abundant training data and generalize poorly under small-data regimes and out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, limiting their practical applicability for parametric PDEs.

Method: Proposed PILNO integrates: (1) ALNO backbone with Fourier multiplier for expressivity; (2) Physics residuals from PDE/boundary/initial conditions; (3) Virtual inputs ensemble for physics-only OOD supervision; (4) Time-decay weighting to prioritize early dynamics and stabilize training.

Result: On four PDE benchmarks (Burgers', Darcy, reaction-diffusion, forced KdV), PILNO consistently improves accuracy with ≤27 training samples, reduces run-to-run variance, and outperforms purely data-driven baselines in OOD generalization.

Conclusion: Physics-informed training with strategic virtual inputs and temporal weighting effectively addresses data efficiency and generalization challenges, making neural operators more robust for scientific computing applications.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as fast surrogate solvers for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). However, purely data-driven models often require extensive training data and can generalize poorly, especially in small-data regimes and under unseen (out-of-distribution) input functions that are not represented in the training data. To address these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Laplace Neural Operator (PILNO), which enhances the Laplace Neural Operator (LNO) by embedding governing physics into training through PDE, boundary condition, and initial condition residuals. To improve expressivity, we first introduce an Advanced LNO (ALNO) backbone that retains a pole-residue transient representation while replacing the steady-state branch with an FNO-style Fourier multiplier. To make physics-informed training both data-efficient and robust, PILNO further leverages (i) virtual inputs: an unlabeled ensemble of input functions spanning a broad spectral range that provides abundant physics-only supervision and explicitly targets out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes; and (ii) temporal-causality weighting: a time-decaying reweighting of the physics residual that prioritizes early-time dynamics and stabilizes optimization for time-dependent PDEs. Across four representative benchmarks -- Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, a reaction-diffusion system, and a forced KdV equation -- PILNO consistently improves accuracy in small-data settings (e.g., N_train <= 27), reduces run-to-run variability across random seeds, and achieves stronger OOD generalization than purely data-driven baselines.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Diverging Flows to solve the extrapolation hazard in Flow Matching models by enabling simultaneous conditional generation and native extrapolation detection through structurally enforced inefficient transport for off-manifold inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching models suffer from silent failures in safety-critical applications when making predictions for off-manifold conditions due to smoothness biases, producing plausible but incorrect outputs that are indistinguishable from valid predictions.

Method: Introduces Diverging Flows, a novel approach that structurally enforces inefficient transport for off-manifold inputs, allowing a single model to perform both conditional generation and native extrapolation detection simultaneously.

Result: Demonstrates effective detection of extrapolations without compromising predictive fidelity or inference latency across synthetic manifolds, cross-domain style transfer, and weather temperature forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: Diverging Flows provides a robust solution for trustworthy flow models, enabling reliable deployment in safety-critical domains like medicine, robotics, and climate science.

Abstract: The ability of Flow Matching (FM) to model complex conditional distributions has established it as the state-of-the-art for prediction tasks (e.g., robotics, weather forecasting). However, deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by a critical extrapolation hazard: driven by smoothness biases, flow models yield plausible outputs even for off-manifold conditions, resulting in silent failures indistinguishable from valid predictions. In this work, we introduce Diverging Flows, a novel approach that enables a single model to simultaneously perform conditional generation and native extrapolation detection by structurally enforcing inefficient transport for off-manifold inputs. We evaluate our method on synthetic manifolds, cross-domain style transfer, and weather temperature forecasting, demonstrating that it achieves effective detection of extrapolations without compromising predictive fidelity or inference latency. These results establish Diverging Flows as a robust solution for trustworthy flow models, paving the way for reliable deployment in domains such as medicine, robotics, and climate science.

TL;DR: Split-MoPE is a novel Vertical Federated Learning framework that combines Split Learning with a Mixture of Predefined Experts architecture to address partial sample alignment, achieving single-round communication, robustness against malicious participants, and per-sample interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VFL frameworks rely on unrealistic assumption of full sample alignment across participants, which rarely holds in real-world scenarios, limiting data utilization and practical deployment.

Method: Integrates Split Learning with specialized Mixture of Predefined Experts (MoPE) using predefined experts for specific data alignments instead of dynamic routing, leveraging pretrained encoders for target domains.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in a single communication round, significantly reducing communication overhead while outperforming LASER and Vertical SplitNN, especially under high data missingness.

Conclusion: Split-MoPE bridges the gap between idealized VFL assumptions and real-world constraints, providing an efficient, robust, and interpretable solution for privacy-sensitive collaborative learning.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a critical paradigm for collaborative model training in privacy-sensitive domains such as finance and healthcare. However, most existing VFL frameworks rely on the idealized assumption of full sample alignment across participants, a premise that rarely holds in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, this work introduces Split-MoPE, a novel framework that integrates Split Learning with a specialized Mixture of Predefined Experts (MoPE) architecture. Unlike standard Mixture of Experts (MoE), where routing is learned dynamically, MoPE uses predefined experts to process specific data alignments, effectively maximizing data usage during both training and inference without requiring full sample overlap. By leveraging pretrained encoders for target data domains, Split-MoPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in a single communication round, significantly reducing the communication footprint compared to multi-round end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike existing proposals that address sample misalignment, this novel architecture provides inherent robustness against malicious or noisy participants and offers per-sample interpretability by quantifying each collaborator's contribution to each prediction. Extensive evaluations on vision (CIFAR-10/100) and tabular (Breast Cancer Wisconsin) datasets demonstrate that Split-MoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as LASER and Vertical SplitNN, particularly in challenging scenarios with high data missingness.

Meanwhile, most existing trajectory generation methods implicitly assume that at least a subset of real mobility data from target city is available, which limits their applicability in data-inaccessible scenarios. In this work, we propose a new problem setting, called bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation, where no mobility trajectories from a target city are accessible. The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories.

TL;DR: ADEPT is an agentic framework that uses SLLMs with probing tools for emotion recognition, shifting from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven reasoning by treating minority emotions as signals, improving accuracy with auditable evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLLMs produce ungrounded, text-biased emotion judgments without acoustic evidence, while self-supervised speech encoders lack interpretability - creating a gap between high-level reasoning and verifiable acoustic representations.

Method: ADEPT transforms SLLMs into agents that conduct multi-turn inquiry via candidate emotion sets and dedicated probing tools, integrating GRPO with an Evidence Trust Gate to enforce evidence-grounded reasoning.

Result: The framework improves primary emotion accuracy and significantly enhances minor emotion characterization while providing explanations grounded in auditable acoustic and semantic evidence.

Conclusion: ADEPT successfully bridges the interpretability gap in speech emotion recognition by enabling ambiguity-driven reasoning that treats co-occurring emotions as informative signals rather than noise.

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SLLMs) enable high-level emotion reasoning but often produce ungrounded, text-biased judgments without verifiable acoustic evidence. In contrast, self-supervised speech encoders such as WavLM provide strong acoustic representations yet remain opaque discriminative models with limited interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce ADEPT (Agentic Decoding of Emotion via Evidence Probing Tools), a framework that reframes emotion recognition as a multi-turn inquiry process rather than a single-pass prediction. ADEPT transforms an SLLM into an agent that maintains an evolving candidate emotion set and adaptively invokes dedicated semantic and acoustic probing tools within a structured pipeline of candidate generation, evidence collection, and adjudication. Crucially, ADEPT enables a paradigm shift from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven emotion reasoning. Since human affect exhibits inherent complexity and frequent co-occurrence of emotions, we treat minority annotations as informative perceptual signals rather than discarding them as noise. Finally, we integrate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an Evidence Trust Gate to explicitly couple tool-usage behaviors with prediction quality and enforce evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments show that ADEPT improves primary emotion accuracy in most settings while substantially improving minor emotion characterization, producing explanations grounded in auditable acoustic and semantic evidence.

TL;DR: 本文研究了将时间序列转换为离散潜在表示（使用VQ-VAE和DVAE）是否能提升模型可解释性。通过在压缩表示上应用XAI方法，并结合新提出的SSA指标来验证解释的忠实性，发现离散表示不仅能保持分类性能，还能生成更简洁、结构化且计算高效的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在时间序列分类上表现优异，但缺乏可解释性。尽管XAI技术旨在提高模型透明度，但原始时间序列数据的高维度和噪声严重阻碍了XAI方法的有效性。

Method: 采用向量量化变分自编码器（VQ-VAE）和离散变分自编码器（DVAE）将时间序列转换为离散潜在表示，以减少冗余并聚焦关键信息；在这些压缩表示上应用XAI方法；提出相似子序列准确率（SSA）这一新指标，用于量化评估XAI识别出的重要子序列与训练数据标签分布的对齐程度。

Result: 离散潜在表示在保持分类性能的同时，能生成简洁、结构化且忠实于模型的解释；SSA指标为验证XAI方法所突出特征是否真正代表学习到的分类模式提供了系统化的评估方式。

Conclusion: 离散潜在表示不仅保留了分类所需的关键特征，还为时间序列分析提供了更紧凑、可解释且计算高效的解释路径。

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly improved time series classification, yet the lack of explainability in these models remains a major challenge. While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques aim to make model decisions more transparent, their effectiveness is often hindered by the high dimensionality and noise present in raw time series data. In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations-using methods such as Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)-not only preserves but enhances explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on the most informative patterns. We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns. Our findings demonstrate that discrete latent representations not only retain the essential characteristics needed for classification but also offer a pathway to more compact, interpretable, and computationally efficient explanations in time series analysis.

Motivation: Deep TSC models have strong performance but high computational/memory requirements that limit deployment on resource-constrained devices, and existing pruning methods rely on manual hyperparameter tuning that limits scalability across datasets.

Method: Dynamic Structured Pruning (DSP) framework that uses instance-wise sparsity loss during training to induce channel-level sparsity, followed by global activation analysis to automatically identify and prune redundant filters without predefined pruning ratios.

Result: Validated on 128 UCR datasets with LITETime and InceptionTime architectures, achieving average compression of 58% and 75% respectively while maintaining classification accuracy, producing compact and informative representations.

Conclusion: DSP offers a practical solution for scalable and efficient deep TSC deployment on resource-constrained devices by automatically removing redundant filters without manual hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Deep learning models for Time Series Classification (TSC) have achieved strong predictive performance but their high computational and memory requirements often limit deployment on resource-constrained devices. While structured pruning can address these issues by removing redundant filters, existing methods typically rely on manually tuned hyperparameters such as pruning ratios which limit scalability and generalization across datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic Structured Pruning (DSP), a fully automatic, structured pruning framework for convolution-based TSC models. DSP introduces an instance-wise sparsity loss during training to induce channel-level sparsity, followed by a global activation analysis to identify and prune redundant filters without needing any predefined pruning ratio. This work tackles computational bottlenecks of deep TSC models for deployment on resource-constrained devices. We validate DSP on 128 UCR datasets using two different deep state-of-the-art architectures: LITETime and InceptionTime. Our approach achieves an average compression of 58% for LITETime and 75% for InceptionTime architectures while maintaining classification accuracy. Redundancy analyses confirm that DSP produces compact and informative representations, offering a practical path for scalable and efficient deep TSC deployment.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding neural architectures' ability to learn to execute discrete algorithms, a line of work often referred to as neural algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 提出分层后继表征(HSR)解决经典SR的策略依赖性和谱扩散问题，通过时间抽象获得稳定状态特征，结合非负矩阵分解实现高效迁移和探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典后继表征(SR)存在两大局限：1) 策略依赖性导致策略变化时预测表征失效；2) 在复杂环境中出现谱扩散，产生密集重叠特征且扩展性差。

Method: 1) 引入时间抽象构建分层后继表征(HSR)，获得抗策略变化的稳定状态特征；2) 应用非负矩阵分解(HSR-NMF)生成稀疏低秩表征。

Result: 1) 实现多 compartment 环境中的高样本效率迁移；2) 发现可解释的拓扑结构，形成策略无关的分层地图；3) 在大型程序生成环境中实现高效探索。

Conclusion: HSR通过时间抽象和稀疏分解，有效连接了无模型最优性与有模型灵活性，为任务迁移和探索提供了强大基础框架。

Abstract: The successor representation (SR) provides a powerful framework for decoupling predictive dynamics from rewards, enabling rapid generalisation across reward configurations. However, the classical SR is limited by its inherent policy dependence: policies change due to ongoing learning, environmental non-stationarities, and changes in task demands, making established predictive representations obsolete. Furthermore, in topologically complex environments, SRs suffer from spectral diffusion, leading to dense and overlapping features that scale poorly. Here we propose the Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) for overcoming these limitations. By incorporating temporal abstractions into the construction of predictive representations, HSR learns stable state features which are robust to task-induced policy changes. Applying non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to the HSR yields a sparse, low-rank state representation that facilitates highly sample-efficient transfer to novel tasks in multi-compartmental environments. Further analysis reveals that HSR-NMF discovers interpretable topological structures, providing a policy-agnostic hierarchical map that effectively bridges model-free optimality and model-based flexibility. Beyond providing a useful basis for task-transfer, we show that HSR's temporally extended predictive structure can also be leveraged to drive efficient exploration, effectively scaling to large, procedurally generated environments.

TL;DR: 针对大语言模型在时间序列预测中因开环自回归导致的误差累积问题，本文提出F-LLM闭环框架，通过可学习的残差估计器和反馈控制器主动稳定预测轨迹，并提供理论上的误差有界保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM时间序列预测方法采用朴素自回归策略，在推理时以开环方式递归使用模型自身生成的输出，导致暴露偏差问题，即早期微小误差会随预测时长级联放大，造成严重轨迹漂移。

Method: 从控制理论角度重新形式化自回归预测，提出F-LLM（Feedback-driven LLM）闭环框架。该框架包含可学习的残差估计器（Observer）和反馈控制器，通过主动修正预测误差来稳定长期轨迹。理论证明当基础模型满足局部Lipschitz约束时，该机制能保证误差一致有界。

Result: 在多个时间序列基准测试上，F-LLM显著缓解了误差传播问题，相比现有方法取得了良好的预测性能，验证了闭环机制的有效性。

Conclusion: F-LLM成功解决了LLM在长期时间序列预测中的暴露偏差问题，其闭环设计提供了理论稳定性保证和实际性能提升，为LLM在时序预测领域的应用提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown exceptional potential in time series forecasting, leveraging their inherent sequential reasoning capabilities to model complex temporal dynamics. However, existing approaches typically employ a naive autoregressive generation strategy. We identify a critical theoretical flaw in this paradigm: during inference, the model operates in an open-loop manner, consuming its own generated outputs recursively. This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our closed-loop mechanism ensures uniformly bounded error, provided the base model satisfies a local Lipschitz constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-LLM significantly mitigates error propagation, achieving good performance on time series benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦Granger因果分析算法仅提供确定性的因果关系点估计，忽略了数据噪声（偶然不确定性）和模型变异性（认知不确定性），这在工业应用中可能导致不可靠的因果推断结果。

Method: 系统分类了不确定性来源（偶然不确定性与认知不确定性），推导出描述客户端-服务器交互过程中不确定性演化的闭式递推关系，识别了四个耦合数据不确定性与模型参数不确定性的交叉协方差分量，并定义了严格的收敛条件。

Result: 获得了服务器和客户端模型参数的显式稳态方差表达式，证明稳态方差仅依赖于客户端数据统计特性而非初始认知先验；在合成基准和真实工业数据集上的实证评估表明，显式表征不确定性显著提升了联邦因果推断的可靠性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该不确定性量化框架增强了联邦Granger因果分析的鲁棒性，为分布式时间序列因果推断提供了更可靠的理论基础，对智能电网等工业应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Granger Causality (GC) provides a rigorous framework for learning causal structures from time-series data. Recent federated variants of GC have targeted distributed infrastructure applications (e.g., smart grids) with distributed clients that generate high-dimensional data bound by data-sovereignty constraints. However, Federated GC algorithms only yield deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty. This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric (data noise) from epistemic (model variability) effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that explicitly characterizing uncertainty significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference.

Abstract: Jhana advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J) is related to profound changes in consciousness and cognitive processing, making the study of their neural correlates vital for insights into consciousness and well-being. This study evaluates whether functional MRI-derived regional homogeneity (ReHo) can be used to classify ACAM-J using machine-learning approaches. We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. These findings advocate machine-learning's feasibility in classifying advanced meditation states, future research on neuromodulation and mechanistic models of advanced meditation.

Abstract: Accurate production forecasts are essential to continue facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid. This paper illustrates how to obtain probabilistic day-ahead forecasts of wind power generation via gradient boosting trees using an ensemble of weather forecasts. To this end, we perform a comparative analysis across three state-of-the-art probabilistic prediction methods-conformalised quantile regression, natural gradient boosting and conditional diffusion models-all of which can be combined with tree-based machine learning. The methods are validated using four years of data for all wind farms present within the Belgian offshore zone. Additionally, the point forecasts are benchmarked against deterministic engineering methods, using either the power curve or an advanced approach incorporating a calibrated analytical wake model. The experimental results show that the machine learning methods improve the mean absolute error by up to 53% and 33% compared to the power curve and the calibrated wake model. Considering the three probabilistic prediction methods, the conditional diffusion model is found to yield the best overall probabilistic and point estimate of wind power generation. Moreover, the findings suggest that the use of an ensemble of weather forecasts can improve point forecast accuracy by up to 23%.

Conclusion: 凸优化方法能为纺织接口实现高效片上机器学习。当前研究局限在于单用户实验室环境，实际应用需多用户、多环境和更复杂手势的验证。

Abstract: Wearable e-textile interfaces require gesture recognition capabilities but face severe constraints in power consumption, computational capacity, and form factor that make traditional deep learning impractical. While lightweight architectures like MobileNet improve efficiency, they still demand thousands of parameters, limiting deployment on textile-integrated platforms. We introduce a convexified attention mechanism for wearable applications that dynamically weights features while preserving convexity through nonexpansive simplex projection and convex loss functions. Unlike conventional attention mechanisms using non-convex softmax operations, our approach employs Euclidean projection onto the probability simplex combined with multi-class hinge loss, ensuring global convergence guarantees. Implemented on a textile-based capacitive sensor with four connection points, our approach achieves 100.00\% accuracy on tap gestures and 100.00\% on swipe gestures -- consistent across 10-fold cross-validation and held-out test evaluation -- while requiring only 120--360 parameters, a 97\% reduction compared to conventional approaches. With sub-millisecond inference times (290--296$μ$s) and minimal storage requirements ($<$7KB), our method enables gesture interfaces directly within e-textiles without external processing. Our evaluation, conducted in controlled laboratory conditions with a single-user dataset, demonstrates feasibility for basic gesture interactions. Real-world deployment would require validation across multiple users, environmental conditions, and more complex gesture vocabularies. These results demonstrate how convex optimization can enable efficient on-device machine learning for textile interfaces.

Motivation: Existing robust Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) methods focus on single-step perturbations and temporally independent adversarial models, lacking explicit modeling of robustness against temporally coupled perturbations, which is critical for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and robotics.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that TCRL consistently outperforms existing methods in robustness against temporally coupled perturbation attacks across a variety of CRL tasks.

Conclusion: TCRL successfully addresses the challenge of temporally coupled perturbations in constrained reinforcement learning by providing a robust framework that eliminates the need for explicit adversarial modeling while maintaining strong performance and safety guarantees.

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) aims to optimize decision-making policies under constraint conditions, making it highly applicable to safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and power grid management. However, existing robust CRL approaches predominantly focus on single-step perturbations and temporally independent adversarial models, lacking explicit modeling of robustness against temporally coupled perturbations. To tackle these challenges, we propose TCRL, a novel temporal-coupled adversarial training framework for robust constrained reinforcement learning (TCRL) in worst-case scenarios. First, TCRL introduces a worst-case-perceived cost constraint function that estimates safety costs under temporally coupled perturbations without the need to explicitly model adversarial attackers. Second, TCRL establishes a dual-constraint defense mechanism on the reward to counter temporally coupled adversaries while maintaining reward unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that TCRL consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness against temporally coupled perturbation attacks across a variety of CRL tasks.

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAIMs) are increasingly regarded as a core intelligence engine for embodied AI applications. However, the massive parameter scale and computational demands of LAIMs pose significant challenges for resource-limited embodied agents. To address this issue, we investigate quantization-aware collaborative inference (co-inference) for embodied AI systems. First, we develop a tractable approximation for quantization-induced inference distortion. Based on this approximation, we derive lower and upper bounds on the quantization rate-inference distortion function, characterizing its dependence on LAIM statistics, including the quantization bit-width. Next, we formulate a joint quantization bit-width and computation frequency design problem under delay and energy constraints, aiming to minimize the distortion upper bound while ensuring tightness through the corresponding lower bound. Extensive evaluations validate the proposed distortion approximation, the derived rate-distortion bounds, and the effectiveness of the proposed joint design. Particularly, simulations and real-world testbed experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint design in balancing inference quality, latency, and energy consumption in edge embodied AI systems.

Conclusion: 研究强调了在物联网环境中保护CCL模型的重要性，为未来设计更安全、资源高效的持续学习算法提供了理论基础和实践指导

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly depend on continual learning to adapt to non-stationary environments. These environments can include factors such as sensor drift, changing user behavior, device aging, and adversarial dynamics. Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems. We formalize the objectives of embedding-level attacks, examine persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, and develop a layered taxonomy tailored to IoT. Additionally, we compare vulnerabilities across various learning paradigms and evaluate defense strategies under IoT constraints, including limited memory, edge computing, and federated aggregation. Our findings indicate that while CCL is effective for enhancing adaptive IoT intelligence, it may also elevate long-lived representation-level threats if not adequately secured.

*Juneyoung Park,Yuri Hong,Seongwan Kim,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MeSP提出了一种内存高效的结构化反向传播方法，通过手动推导反向传播过程来利用LoRA的低秩结构，在反向过程中重新计算中间投影而非存储，实现了49%的内存降低同时保持数学上完全相同的梯度，使大语言模型在内存受限的移动设备上的微调成为可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动设备上对大型语言模型进行个性化微调时面临严重的内存约束（通常6-12GB），现有方法不得不在精确梯度（高内存）和近似梯度（低内存但噪声大）之间做权衡。

Method: 提出内存高效结构化反向传播（MeSP），核心洞察是手动推导反向传播过程，利用LoRA的低秩特性：在反向传播时重新计算中间投影h=xA，因为秩r远小于输入维度d_in，从而避免存储该激活值。

Result: 在Qwen2.5模型（0.5B-3B）上实现49%的平均内存降低，计算数学上完全相同的梯度；分析显示MeZO的梯度估计与真实梯度相关性接近零（余弦相似度≈0.001），解释了其收敛慢的原因；Qwen2.5-0.5B的峰值内存从361MB降至136MB。

Conclusion: MeSP方法实现了在内存受限设备上原本不可行的微调场景，为隐私保护的设备端大模型个性化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning enables privacy-preserving personalization of large language models, but mobile devices impose severe memory constraints, typically 6--12GB shared across all workloads. Existing approaches force a trade-off between exact gradients with high memory (MeBP) and low memory with noisy estimates (MeZO). We propose Memory-efficient Structured Backpropagation (MeSP), which bridges this gap by manually deriving backward passes that exploit LoRA's low-rank structure. Our key insight is that the intermediate projection $h = xA$ can be recomputed during backward at minimal cost since rank $r \ll d_{in}$, eliminating the need to store it. MeSP achieves 49\% average memory reduction compared to MeBP on Qwen2.5 models (0.5B--3B) while computing mathematically identical gradients. Our analysis also reveals that MeZO's gradient estimates show near-zero correlation with true gradients (cosine similarity $\approx$0.001), explaining its slow convergence. MeSP reduces peak memory from 361MB to 136MB for Qwen2.5-0.5B, enabling fine-tuning scenarios previously infeasible on memory-constrained devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LCSB speeds up LLM fine-tuning on mobile devices by selectively backpropagating through subsets of layers, achieving up to 1.40x speedup with minimal quality loss


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MeBP enables LLM fine-tuning on mobile devices (<1GB memory) but suffers from high backward computation cost (32-42% time spent on weight decompression across all layers)

Method: Proposes Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation (LCSB) that computes gradients for only subset of layers per step, leveraging residual connections for gradient flow and AdamW momentum for implicit updates. Theoretically frames as Block Coordinate Descent on LoRA space.

Result: Achieves 1.40x speedup with <2% quality degradation across 5 models/3 tasks; shows superior stability in 4-bit quantization (3B model that diverges with full backprop converges smoothly with LCSB)

Conclusion: Selective gradient computation via LCSB provides efficient and stable fine-tuning for resource-constrained devices through implicit regularization effects

Abstract: Memory-efficient backpropagation (MeBP) has enabled first-order fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) on mobile devices with less than 1GB memory. However, MeBP requires backward computation through all transformer layers at every step, where weight decompression alone accounts for 32--42% of backward time. We propose Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation (LCSB), which computes gradients for only a subset of layers per step. Our key insight is that residual connections guarantee gradient flow through identity paths, while AdamW momentum provides implicit updates for non-selected layers. We interpret LCSB as Block Coordinate Descent on the LoRA parameter space, providing theoretical justification for convergence. LCSB achieves up to 1.40$\times$ speedup with less than 2\% quality degradation across five models and three tasks. Surprisingly, in 4-bit quantized settings, LCSB exhibits superior stability: a 3B model that completely diverges under full backpropagation converges smoothly with LCSB, suggesting an implicit regularization effect from selective gradient computation.

Motivation: 现有图预训练方法仅针对单一图类型（同质或异构），无法应对真实世界中混合图类型与分布偏移的挑战，导致跨域迁移性能受限

Method: 1) 统一多视图图构建：无需类型特化设计同时编码两种图结构；2) 领域专家编码：独立预训练单图专家捕获领域知识；3) 任务导向专家融合：根据判别性动态整合多专家特征

Result: 在混合图下游任务中显著优于现有方法，实现跨图类型和跨领域的稳定迁移，验证了混合预训练的有效性

Conclusion: 首次实现同质与异构图的统一预训练框架，通过专家隔离与自适应融合解决分布差异问题，为真实场景图学习提供新范式

Abstract: Graph pre-training has achieved remarkable success in recent years, delivering transferable representations for downstream adaptation. However, most existing methods are designed for either homogeneous or heterogeneous graphs, thereby hindering unified graph modeling across diverse graph types. This separation contradicts real-world applications, where mixed homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs are ubiquitous, and distribution shifts between upstream pre-training and downstream deployment are common. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that a balanced mixture of homogeneous and heterogeneous graph pre-training benefits downstream tasks and propose a unified multi-domain \textbf{G}raph \textbf{P}re-training method across \textbf{H}omogeneous and \textbf{H}eterogeneous graphs ($\mathbf{GPH^{2}}$). To address the lack of a unified encoder for homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, we propose a Unified Multi-View Graph Construction that simultaneously encodes both without explicit graph-type-specific designs. To cope with the increased cross-domain distribution discrepancies arising from mixed graphs, we introduce domain-specific expert encoding. Each expert is independently pre-trained on a single graph to capture domain-specific knowledge, thereby shielding the pre-training encoder from the adverse effects of cross-domain discrepancies. For downstream tasks, we further design a Task-oriented Expert Fusion Strategy that adaptively integrates multiple experts based on their discriminative strengths. Extensive experiments on mixed graphs demonstrate that $\text{GPH}^{2}$ enables stable transfer across graph types and domains, significantly outperforming existing graph pre-training methods.

TL;DR: 针对R-Zero等自博弈框架在LLM推理训练中存在的"多样性幻觉"问题，本文提出R-Diverse框架，通过记忆增强惩罚(MAP)和技能感知度量(SAM)来缓解局部多样性幻觉和表面多样性幻觉，在10个数学和通用推理基准测试中实现了持续的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自博弈框架(如R-Zero)在提升LLM推理能力时表现出非持续改进现象，早期收益随着训练继续而退化。研究发现这是由"多样性幻觉"导致，包括局部多样性幻觉(仅批次内多样性)和表面多样性幻觉(问题表面变化但推理技能重复)。

Method: 提出R-Diverse框架，包含两个核心创新：(1)记忆增强惩罚(MAP)，利用持久记忆库避免跨迭代的问题重复；(2)技能感知度量(SAM)，基于问题所需的推理技能而非表面形式来评估多样性。

Result: 在10个数学和通用推理基准测试上，R-Diverse能够持续多轮迭代保持性能提升，始终优于先前的自博弈方法。

Conclusion: 通过解决多样性幻觉问题，R-Diverse框架能够更有效地维持LLM在自博弈训练中的持续进步，为构建更强大的推理模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Self-play bootstraps LLM reasoning through an iterative Challenger-Solver loop: the Challenger is trained to generate questions that target the Solver's capabilities, and the Solver is optimized on the generated data to expand its reasoning skills. However, existing frameworks like R-Zero often exhibit non-sustained improvement, where early gains degrade as self-play continues. We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions. Across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Gengsheng-Li/R-Diverse.

TL;DR: 提出结构感知的无模板逆合成框架，通过原子位置偏置提升学习效率，实现SOTA性能且大幅减少采样步数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：无模板方法作为黑箱序列生成效率低，半模板方法依赖刚性反应库泛化性差

Method: 基于原子排序关键洞察，构建结构感知框架：1) 将反应中心原子置于序列头部形成位置偏置；2) 采用RetroDiT图Transformer（含旋转位置编码）；3) 结合离散流匹配实现训练与采样解耦

Result: 在USPTO-50k达到61.2% top-1准确率（USPTO-Full为51.3%），采样步数降至20-50步（先前方法需500步），小模型（280K参数）性能匹敌大模型（65M参数）

Conclusion: 结构先验优于暴力扩展：显式编码化学知识的位置模式显著提升模型效率，性能超越千亿级反应训练的基础模型，且数据需求量级更低

Abstract: Template-free retrosynthesis methods treat the task as black-box sequence generation, limiting learning efficiency, while semi-template approaches rely on rigid reaction libraries that constrain generalization. We address this gap with a key insight: atom ordering in neural representations matters. Building on this insight, we propose a structure-aware template-free framework that encodes the two-stage nature of chemical reactions as a positional inductive bias. By placing reaction center atoms at the sequence head, our method transforms implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns that the model can readily capture. The proposed RetroDiT backbone, a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings, exploits this ordering to prioritize chemically critical regions. Combined with discrete flow matching, our approach decouples training from sampling and enables generation in 20--50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both USPTO-50k (61.2% top-1) and the large-scale USPTO-Full (51.3% top-1) with predicted reaction centers. With oracle centers, performance reaches 71.1% and 63.4% respectively, surpassing foundation models trained on 10 billion reactions while using orders of magnitude less data. Ablation studies further reveal that structural priors outperform brute-force scaling: a 280K-parameter model with proper ordering matches a 65M-parameter model without it.

TL;DR: 针对大语言模型遗忘与量化部署的冲突问题，本文提出LoRA适配器方法，在冻结主模型情况下集中参数更新，使4-bit量化下遗忘效果提升7.93分，隐私泄露减少19.82分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际部署中，大语言模型遗忘后需要进行低比特量化（PTQ）以实现高效推理，但激进的低比特量化会掩盖或擦除遗忘更新，导致模型恢复到遗忘前的行为。标准全参数微调在4-bit量化下更新量过小，无法保持遗忘效果。

Method: 提出通过低秩适应（LoRA）实现量化鲁棒的遗忘：冻结基础模型参数，将遗忘学习集中在可训练的适配器中，使有效更新在量化后得以保留。

Result: 在Llama-2-7B和MUSE数据集（BOOKS/NEWS）上，LoRA将4-bit量化下的效用提升最高7.93点（BOOKS: 50.17→58.10），NEWS提升4.76点（40.06→44.82）；隐私泄露指标PrivLeak从-25.68改善至-5.86（更接近理想值0），同时保持强遗忘效果（VerMem和KnowMem接近0）。

Conclusion: 使用LoRA进行机器遗忘在需要量化的部署场景中更具优势，能有效平衡遗忘效果与量化压缩的需求。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to remove targeted knowledge from a trained model, but practical deployments often require post-training quantization (PTQ) for efficient inference. However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment.

Conclusion: 该模型成功适用于密度差异显著（水/空气）及不显著（液氢/氢气）的分层流模拟，为复杂截面管道的气液两相流提供了可靠的理论与数值框架。

Abstract: In this work, we derive a new model for immiscible two-layer gas-liquid stratified flows in pipes with general cross sections. The bottom layer is occupied by an incompressible fluid in liquid phase with hydrodynamics based on a hydrostatic pressure, following a shallow water approximation. The top layer is occupied by a compressible gas, following an ideal gas law leading to conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The two subsystems are linked through non-conservative products, representing momentum and energy exchanges between layers. The hyperbolic properties of the resulting model are analyzed, including the derivation of entropy inequalities, and the approximations of eigenvalues of the corresponding coefficient matrix. Numerical tests are included to demonstrate the merits of the model and the numerical approximations, including well-balancedness, Riemann problems, and perturbations and convergence toward steady states at rest. Besides simulations of water and air where the density difference between layers is significant, a case where such difference is not so pronounced (like gas and liquid hydrogen) is also shown.

Abstract: Employing both electrodynamics coupled with molecular dynamics (ED-MD) simulations for atomistic models and the dynamic instability theory of electrocapillary wave, we investigate the structure evolutions and thermal runaway process of Cu, Ti and W nanotips with radii of curvature of 1 nm and 5 nm under various radiofrequency electric field conditions. The associated critical parameters including the critical electric field, spatial and temporal scales of the electrohydrodynamic instability of molten apexes are obtained by proposing the workflows that utilize the atomistic models in ED-MD simulations to calculate kinematic viscosity tensor components and mass density spatial distributions for the nanomelts with electric fields. Our current ED-MD simulations for nanotips show a non-monotonical variation of the time delay versus the electric field frequency for metal nanotips, and the presence of a critical rf electric field amplitude triggering the thermal runaway regardless of the field frequency. The calculated mass densities and kinematic viscosities of nanomelts for metal nanotips are found to be drastically different to those of bulk liquid metals at the melting point. Specifically, the viscosity of nanomelt under the rf electric field is revealed to be several orders of magnitude higher than the bulk liquid metal, resulting in substantial increase of spatial and temporal scales in the instability theory of electrocapillary wave within the viscosity-dominated regime, compared to the results of ED-MD simulations for Cu and Ti metals, while good agreement between the two methods on the critical wavelength and time delay of thermal runway is found for W nanotips.

Abstract: Advanced computational tools that describe the interaction of electrons with structured nanophotonic materials are crucial for theoretical predictions, specific design tasks, and the interpretation of experimental results. These tools open the door to systematic exploration of free-electron-driven nanophotonic light sources, among others. Here, we report on the implementation of electron-beam spectroscopy in a T-matrix-based scattering formulation. Such a framework is quite versatile in predicting the electromagnetic response of complex photonic materials composed of periodically or aperiodically arranged individual scatterers. By extending this formalism to describe interactions with fast electrons, we provide a fast and accurate numerical tool for simulating cathodoluminescence (CL) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements. The desired functionalities are implemented into the existing software suite treams for electromagnetic scattering computations, and the extended code treams_ebeam is available online at https://github.com/tfp-photonics/treams_ebeam. We demonstrate the implementation details on a carefully selected set of problems, including single scatterers of various shapes and materials, a periodic chain of elliptical nanodisks, and a finite cluster of nanospheres arranged in a two-dimensional (2D) lattice. By uniting fast-electron physics with advanced scattering theory, our framework unlocks new possibilities for designing, understanding, and engineering next-generation nanoscale light-matter interactions.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: A novel one-way shooting algorithm for transition path sampling eliminates trajectory rejection by always accepting proposed paths while correcting bias via reweighting, enabling efficient simulation of rare events like CO₂ hydrate formation under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional transition path sampling methods suffer from low efficiency due to high computational cost of generating and rejecting non-reactive trajectories, especially for rare events like crystal hydrate formation at extreme temperatures/pressures.

Method: Combines two innovations: (1) A trajectory proposal mechanism guaranteeing all generated paths are reactive, and (2) a statistical reweighting scheme to compensate for the bias introduced by unconditional acceptance of paths.

Result: The algorithm successfully samples the correct transition path ensemble for overdamped stochastic systems while completely avoiding trajectory rejection, demonstrating significantly improved computational efficiency over conventional methods.

Conclusion: This approach enables proper sampling of rare transition events (e.g., CO₂ clathrate hydrate crystallization) at previously inaccessible thermodynamic conditions by eliminating the computational bottleneck of trajectory rejection.

Abstract: We present a one-way shooting algorithm for transition path sampling that accepts every proposed trajectory yet samples the correct transition path ensemble for systems with overdamped stochastic dynamics. The method is based on two key elements: a procedure to propose trajectories that are always reactive, and a reweighting scheme that corrects for the bias introduced by always accepting the proposed paths. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of transition path sampling by eliminating the cost associated with generating trajectories that are then rejected. We demonstrate the algorithm by investigating the formation of CO$_2$ clathrate hydrates along different reaction mechanisms, showing that the increased efficiency allows proper sampling of the formation of crystalline hydrates at temperatures and pressures that are difficult to access with conventional algorithms.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are increasingly capable and deployed in high-stakes multi-agent environments. However, existing AI safety benchmarks largely evaluate single agents, leaving multi-agent risks such as coordination failure and conflict poorly understood. We introduce GT-HarmBench, a benchmark of 2,009 high-stakes scenarios spanning game-theoretic structures such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Stag Hunt and Chicken. Scenarios are drawn from realistic AI risk contexts in the MIT AI Risk Repository. Across 15 frontier models, agents choose socially beneficial actions in only 62% of cases, frequently leading to harmful outcomes. We measure sensitivity to game-theoretic prompt framing and ordering, and analyze reasoning patterns driving failures. We further show that game-theoretic interventions improve socially beneficial outcomes by up to 18%. Our results highlight substantial reliability gaps and provide a broad standardized testbed for studying alignment in multi-agent environments.

Motivation: Current SOTA multi-domain RLVR uses either mixed multi-task training or separate training with model merging, but lacks detailed comparison; understanding domain collaboration is crucial for building general expert-level LLMs.

Method: Evaluated math, coding, science, and instruction following domains using open-source datasets with qualitative/quantitative experiments; analyzed mechanisms via weight space geometry, model prediction behavior, and information constraints.

Result: RLVR across domains shows few mutual interferences; reasoning-intensive domains (math/coding) exhibit mutual synergy; identified internal mechanisms of cross-domain gains.

Conclusion: M2RL project demonstrates that both paradigms are viable for multi-domain RLVR, with reasoning domains benefiting from collaboration, providing insights for future LLM training strategies.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) plays a key role in stimulating the explicit reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). We can achieve expert-level performance in some specific domains via RLVR, such as coding or math. When a general multi-domain expert-level model is required, we need to carefully consider the collaboration of RLVR across different domains. The current state-of-the-art models mainly employ two different training paradigms for multi-domain RLVR: mixed multi-task RLVR and separate RLVR followed by model merging. However, most of the works did not provide a detailed comparison and analysis about these paradigms. To this end, we choose multiple commonly used high-level tasks (e.g., math, coding, science, and instruction following) as our target domains and design extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments using open-source datasets. We find the RLVR across domains exhibits few mutual interferences, and reasoning-intensive domains demonstrate mutually synergistic effects. Furthermore, we analyze the internal mechanisms of mutual gains from the perspectives of weight space geometry, model prediction behavior, and information constraints. This project is named as M2RL that means Mixed multi-task training or separate training followed by model Merging for Reinforcement Learning, and the homepage is at https://github.com/mosAI25/M2RL

*Joshua Ong Jun Leang,Yu Zhao,Mihaela Cătălina Stoian,Wenda Li,Shay B. Cohen,Eleonora Giunchiglia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: McDiffuSE uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize slot infilling order in Masked Diffusion Models, achieving significant improvements on math and code reasoning tasks by systematically exploring generation order combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plan-and-infill decoding in Masked Diffusion Models shows promise for mathematical and code reasoning, but performance is highly sensitive to slot infilling order, yielding substantial output variance.

Method: Formulates slot selection as decision making and optimizes infilling orders through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with look-ahead simulations to evaluate partial completions before commitment.

Result: Average improvement of 3.2% over autoregressive baselines, 8.0% over baseline plan-and-infill, with 19.5% on MBPP and 4.9% on MATH500.

Conclusion: MCTS-based planning effectively enhances MDM generation quality. While predominantly sequential, non-sequential generation is essential. Larger exploration constants are needed to overcome model confidence biases rather than more simulations.

Abstract: While plan-and-infill decoding in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) shows promise for mathematical and code reasoning, performance remains highly sensitive to slot infilling order, often yielding substantial output variance. We introduce McDiffuSE, a framework that formulates slot selection as decision making and optimises infilling orders through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). McDiffuSE uses look-ahead simulations to evaluate partial completions before commitment, systematically exploring the combinatorial space of generation orders. Experiments show an average improvement of 3.2% over autoregressive baselines and 8.0% over baseline plan-and-infill, with notable gains of 19.5% on MBPP and 4.9% on MATH500. Our analysis reveals that while McDiffuSE predominantly follows sequential ordering, incorporating non-sequential generation is essential for maximising performance. We observe that larger exploration constants, rather than increased simulations, are necessary to overcome model confidence biases and discover effective orderings. These findings establish MCTS-based planning as an effective approach for enhancing generation quality in MDMs.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨运筹学算法、大语言模型和人类如何在多周期库存控制中协同互补。通过构建InventoryBench基准测试和课堂实验，发现OR增强的LLM方法优于单一方法，人机协作团队利润高于单独人类或AI，证明三者具有互补性而非替代关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运筹学库存算法在需求变化和缺乏情境信息时表现不佳，而大语言模型虽具备灵活推理能力但集成方式不明。研究旨在探索OR算法、LLMs和人类如何相互协作而非相互替代。

Method: 构建包含1000多个实例的InventoryBench基准测试（涵盖合成和真实需求数据），用于在需求变化、季节性和不确定提前期下压力测试决策规则；通过对比OR增强的LLM方法与单一方法性能，并开展嵌入LLM推荐的人机协作课堂实验。

Result: OR增强的LLM方法性能优于任一单一方法；人机协作团队平均利润高于单独人类或AI；形式化了个体层面的互补效应，推导出能从AI协作中受益的个体比例的无分布下界，实证显示该比例相当可观。

Conclusion: 运筹学算法、大语言模型和人类在库存控制中是互补关系而非替代关系。将LLM与OR方法结合，并建立结构化的人机协作流程，能显著提升决策性能。

Abstract: Inventory control is a fundamental operations problem in which ordering decisions are traditionally guided by theoretically grounded operations research (OR) algorithms. However, such algorithms often rely on rigid modeling assumptions and can perform poorly when demand distributions shift or relevant contextual information is unavailable. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have generated interest in AI agents that can reason flexibly and incorporate rich contextual signals, but it remains unclear how best to incorporate LLM-based methods into traditional decision-making pipelines.
  We study how OR algorithms, LLMs, and humans can interact and complement each other in a multi-period inventory control setting. We construct InventoryBench, a benchmark of over 1,000 inventory instances spanning both synthetic and real-world demand data, designed to stress-test decision rules under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. Through this benchmark, we find that OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, suggesting that these methods are complementary rather than substitutes.
  We further investigate the role of humans through a controlled classroom experiment that embeds LLM recommendations into a human-in-the-loop decision pipeline. Contrary to prior findings that human-AI collaboration can degrade performance, we show that, on average, human-AI teams achieve higher profits than either humans or AI agents operating alone. Beyond this population-level finding, we formalize an individual-level complementarity effect and derive a distribution-free lower bound on the fraction of individuals who benefit from AI collaboration; empirically, we find this fraction to be substantial.

TL;DR: 针对LLM智能体在多轮任务中固定认知模式的低效问题，本文提出CogRouter框架，通过分层认知级别和两阶段训练实现步骤级认知深度动态调整，在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld上以更少token消耗显著超越现有模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体在多轮决策任务中使用固定的认知模式（非思考型立即响应，思考型深度推理），这种刚性对于认知需求逐步变化的长期任务效率低下

Method: 提出CogRouter框架，基于ACT-R理论设计四个分层认知级别（本能响应到战略规划），采用两阶段训练：CoSFT注入稳定的级别特定模式，CoPO通过置信度感知优势重加权进行步骤级信用分配，核心思想是适当认知深度应最大化结果动作的置信度

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld上达到SOTA性能，Qwen2.5-7B实现82.3%成功率，超越GPT-4o（+40.3%）、OpenAI-o3（+18.3%）和GRPO（+14.0%），同时减少62%的token使用

Conclusion: CogRouter成功实现动态认知深度适应，显著提升任务性能与效率

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for multi-turn decision-making tasks. However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency. With Qwen2.5-7B, it reaches an 82.3% success rate, outperforming GPT-4o (+40.3%), OpenAI-o3 (+18.3%), and GRPO (+14.0%), while using 62% fewer tokens.

Method: 基于蕴含图构建参数化2-CNF公式族，设计五个可解释维度（矛盾环、自由变量、骨干、桥接子句、对称性），在保持表面统计不变下测试LLM决策准确性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了LLM推理器对结构变化的过度敏感性，为理解模型失败提供了精细化工具。

Abstract: Logic provides a controlled testbed for evaluating LLM-based reasoners, yet standard SAT-style benchmarks often conflate surface difficulty (length, wording, clause order) with the structural phenomena that actually determine satisfiability. We introduce a diagnostic benchmark for 2-SAT built from parameterized families of structured 2--CNF formulas, where satisfiability is characterized by the implication graph and can be tuned along interpretable axes. Our generators isolate distinct competencies and failure modes: (i) contradiction-cycle UNSAT cores with controllable size and imbalance, (ii) SAT instances with a prescribed fraction of free variables to control solution multiplicity, (iii) planted backbones that modulate propagation, (iv) late bridge clauses that couple otherwise monotone regions to probe sensitivity to ordering and revision, and (v) symmetry/duplication variants that test abstraction under renaming and redundant structure. We evaluate LLM-based reasoners on decision accuracy and assignment validity, and quantify robustness under semantics-preserving perturbations such as clause reordering, filler clauses, and variable renaming. Across models, we observe sharp performance transitions under targeted structural interventions even when surface statistics are held fixed, revealing brittleness regimes that are invisible to aggregate SAT accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出X-SYS参考架构用于交互式可解释AI系统，包含STAR质量属性（可扩展性、可追踪性、响应性和适应性）和五组件分解，并通过SemanticLens系统在视觉语言模型上实现，提供端到端设计蓝图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管XAI社区提出了大量技术方法，但将可解释性部署为系统仍面临挑战：交互式解释系统需要合适的算法和系统能力，以在重复查询、模型和数据的演进以及治理约束下保持解释的可用性。需要将可解释性视为信息系统问题，其中用户交互需求会引发特定的系统要求。

Method: 引入X-SYS参考架构，围绕STAR（scalability, traceability, responsiveness, adaptability）四个质量属性组织，并定义五组件分解（XUI服务、解释服务、模型服务、数据服务、编排与治理）。通过将交互模式映射到系统能力，解耦用户界面演进与后端计算。

Result: 通过SemanticLens系统实现X-SYS，该系统用于视觉语言模型的语义搜索和激活引导。展示了基于契约的服务边界如何实现独立演进，离线/在线分离如何确保响应性，以及持久状态管理如何支持可追踪性。

Conclusion: 该工作为交互式解释系统提供了可重用的蓝图和具体实例，支持在操作约束下的端到端设计，帮助AI研究人员、开发人员和从业者连接交互式解释用户界面与系统能力。

Abstract: The explainable AI (XAI) research community has proposed numerous technical methods, yet deploying explainability as systems remains challenging: Interactive explanation systems require both suitable algorithms and system capabilities that maintain explanation usability across repeated queries, evolving models and data, and governance constraints. We argue that operationalizing XAI requires treating explainability as an information systems problem where user interaction demands induce specific system requirements. We introduce X-SYS, a reference architecture for interactive explanation systems, that guides (X)AI researchers, developers and practitioners in connecting interactive explanation user interfaces (XUI) with system capabilities. X-SYS organizes around four quality attributes named STAR (scalability, traceability, responsiveness, and adaptability), and specifies a five-component decomposition (XUI Services, Explanation Services, Model Services, Data Services, Orchestration and Governance). It maps interaction patterns to system capabilities to decouple user interface evolution from backend computation. We implement X-SYS through SemanticLens, a system for semantic search and activation steering in vision-language models. SemanticLens demonstrates how contract-based service boundaries enable independent evolution, offline/online separation ensures responsiveness, and persistent state management supports traceability. Together, this work provides a reusable blueprint and concrete instantiation for interactive explanation systems supporting end-to-end design under operational constraints.

Motivation: 探讨AI智能体成功行为是否需要内部世界表征这一基本问题，量化最优策略中蕴含的环境信息量。

Method: 采用受控马尔可夫过程(CMP)框架，假设转移动力学上的均匀先验，通过互信息计算分析环境与最优策略之间的信息量。

Result: 证明对于非恒定奖励函数，最优确定性策略恰好揭示n log m比特的环境信息，该结论适用于有限时域、无限时域折扣和时间平均奖励等多种优化目标。

Conclusion: 为智能体实现最优决策所需的"隐式世界模型"规模建立了精确的信息论下界，表明至少需要n log m比特的环境信息。

Abstract: An important question in the field of AI is the extent to which successful behaviour requires an internal representation of the world. In this work, we quantify the amount of information an optimal policy provides about the underlying environment. We consider a Controlled Markov Process (CMP) with $n$ states and $m$ actions, assuming a uniform prior over the space of possible transition dynamics. We prove that observing a deterministic policy that is optimal for any non-constant reward function then conveys exactly $n \log m$ bits of information about the environment. Specifically, we show that the mutual information between the environment and the optimal policy is $n \log m$ bits. This bound holds across a broad class of objectives, including finite-horizon, infinite-horizon discounted, and time-averaged reward maximization. These findings provide a precise information-theoretic lower bound on the "implicit world model'' necessary for optimality.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了九个前沿推理模型在对抗性攻击下的表现，发现推理能力虽能提升鲁棒性但并不充分，识别出五种失效模式，并指出标准防御方法对推理模型无效甚至适得其反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但其在多轮对抗压力下的鲁棒性尚未得到充分探索。理解推理模型在对抗环境中的脆弱性对于构建更安全的AI系统至关重要。

Method: 研究团队对九个前沿推理模型进行了对抗性攻击评估，通过轨迹分析识别失败模式，并测试了置信度感知响应生成（CARG）防御策略在推理模型上的有效性。

Result: 推理模型相比指令调优基线表现出显著的鲁棒性提升，但仍存在明显脆弱性：误导性建议对所有模型都有效，社交压力的效果因模型而异。轨迹分析揭示了五种失效模式（自我怀疑、社会顺从、建议劫持、情感易感性和推理疲劳），其中前两种占失败案例的50%。此外，适用于标准LLM的CARG防御因推理模型过度自信而失效，随机置信度嵌入反而优于目标提取方法。

Conclusion: 推理能力不能自动赋予对抗性鲁棒性，现有的基于置信度的防御机制需要针对推理模型进行根本性重新设计。研究强调了为推理模型开发专门安全防御策略的必要性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models with reasoning capabilities achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex tasks, but their robustness under multi-turn adversarial pressure remains underexplored. We evaluate nine frontier reasoning models under adversarial attacks. Our findings reveal that reasoning confers meaningful but incomplete robustness: most reasoning models studied significantly outperform instruction-tuned baselines, yet all exhibit distinct vulnerability profiles, with misleading suggestions universally effective and social pressure showing model-specific efficacy. Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures. We further demonstrate that Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), effective for standard LLMs, fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces; counterintuitively, random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction. Our results highlight that reasoning capabilities do not automatically confer adversarial robustness and that confidence-based defenses require fundamental redesign for reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ABA框架局限于接地（无变量）论证和基于命题原子的攻击，限制了其表达能力。为克服这一局限，需要扩展ABA以处理包含约束变量且可覆盖无限域的论证。

Method: 提出一种新的约束ABA（CABA）概念，允许组件和论证包含约束变量；定义基于多种非接地攻击概念的非接地语义。

Result: 新的CABA非接地语义保守地推广了标准ABA语义，即在接地情况下与传统语义一致，同时扩展了对非接地论证的处理能力。

Conclusion: CABA框架显著增强了ABA的表达能力，使其能够处理含变量的论证和无限域问题，同时保持与传统ABA语义的向后兼容性，为结构化论证提供了更通用的理论基础。

Abstract: Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a well-established form of structured argumentation. ABA frameworks with an underlying atomic language are widely studied, but their applicability is limited by a representational restriction to ground (variable-free) arguments and attacks built from propositional atoms. In this paper, we lift this restriction and propose a novel notion of constrained ABA (CABA), whose components, as well as arguments built from them, may include constrained variables, ranging over possibly infinite domains. We define non-ground semantics for CABA, in terms of various notions of non-ground attacks. We show that the new semantics conservatively generalise standard ABA semantics.

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid obstacle avoidance architecture that integrates Optimal Control under clearance with a Fuzzy Rule Based System (FRBS) to enable adaptive constraint handling for unmanned aircraft. Motivated by the limitations of classical optimal control under uncertainty and the need for interpretable decision making in safety critical aviation systems, we design a three stage Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy layer that modulates constraint radii, urgency levels, and activation decisions based on regulatory separation minima and airworthiness guidelines from FAA and EASA. These fuzzy-derived clearances are then incorporated as soft constraints into an optimal control problem solved using the FALCON toolbox and IPOPT. The framework aims to reduce unnecessary recomputations by selectively activating obstacle avoidance updates while maintaining compliance with aviation procedures. A proof of concept implementation using a simplified aircraft model demonstrates that the approach can generate optimal trajectories with computation times of 2,3 seconds per iteration in a single threaded MATLAB environment, suggesting feasibility for near real time applications. However, our experiments revealed a critical software incompatibility in the latest versions of FALCON and IPOPT, in which the Lagrangian penalty term remained identically zero, preventing proper constraint enforcement. This behavior was consistent across scenarios and indicates a solver toolbox regression rather than a modeling flaw. Future work includes validating this effect by reverting to earlier software versions, optimizing the fuzzy membership functions using evolutionary methods, and extending the system to higher fidelity aircraft models and stochastic obstacle environments.

Conclusion: Successfully develops a theoretical framework for Bayesian learning in deep and recurrent networks, providing readers with the necessary tools to understand collective network behavior and typical computations in this field.

Abstract: These lecture notes develop the theory of learning in deep and recurrent neuronal networks from the point of view of Bayesian inference. The aim is to enable the reader to understand typical computations found in the literature in this field. Initial chapters develop the theoretical tools, such as probabilities, moment and cumulant-generating functions, and some notions of large deviation theory, as far as they are needed to understand collective network behavior with large numbers of parameters. The main part of the notes derives the theory of Bayesian inference for deep and recurrent networks, starting with the neural network Gaussian process (lazy-learning) limit, which is subsequently extended to study feature learning from the point of view of adaptive kernels. The notes also expose the link between the adaptive kernel approach and approaches of kernel rescaling.

Abstract: We propose and investigate a novel two-dimensional (2D) tight-binding model defined on a diamond-dodecagon lattice geometry that hosts multiple flat bands (FBs) and supports topological phase transitions driven by a magnetic flux. This lattice exhibits three completely flat, non-dispersive bands in the band structure in the absence of magnetic flux due to destructive interference in the electron hoppings, leading to the emergence of compact localized states (CLS). These CLS are analytically constructed and exhibit real-space confinement of the electrons, arising solely due to the lattice's geometrical frustration. It has been shown that these FBs are very robust against the introduction of weak random onsite disorder in the system. By tuning the uniform magnetic flux threaded through the diamond plaquettes, we demonstrate a tunable evolution of the band structure and show that certain bands develop nontrivial topological features with nonzero integer values of the Chern number. Additionally, we have computed the multi-terminal transport properties for this 2D lattice system, which display the flux-tunable resonances and transmission suppression linked to the FBs, establishing a clear interplay between the localization, topology, and transport. Our findings put forward the diamond-dodecagon lattice as a robust and tunable platform for studying the flat-band physics and magnetic flux-controlled topological phenomena, offering promising experimental feasibility in photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems.

*William Skoglund,Elton Giacomelli,Yiqi Yang,Jens H. Bardarson,Erik van Loon*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper introduces the information lattice as an observable-independent framework to analyze quantum phase transitions, demonstrating its utility in distinguishing metallic and insulating regimes of 1D tight-binding chains through distinct information scaling behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional correlation functions for studying phase transitions require explicit observable choices, creating observer-dependence. The information lattice provides an objective, observable-independent method to identify where and at what scale information resides in quantum systems.

Method: Applying the information lattice framework to one-dimensional tight-binding chains to analyze information distribution across scales in metallic vs. insulating regimes.

Result: In metallic regimes (low temperature), information per scale follows a power law with Friedel-like oscillations. In insulating regimes (low temperature) or at high temperatures, information per scale decays exponentially.

Conclusion: The information lattice effectively characterizes metal-insulator transitions by revealing distinct scaling signatures of information distribution, serving as a powerful observer-independent tool for quantum phase analysis.

Abstract: Correlation functions and correlation lengths are frequently used to describe phase transitions in quantum systems, but they require an explicit choice of observables. The recently introduced information lattice instead provides an observable-independent way to identify where and at which scale information is contained in quantum lattice models. Here, we use it to study the difference between the metallic and insulating regime of one-dimensional tight-binding chains. We find that the information per scale follows a power law in metals at low temperature and that Friedel-like oscillations are visible in the information lattice. At high temperature or in insulators at low temperature, the information per scale decays exponentially. Thus, the information lattice is a useful tool for analyzing the metal-insulator transition.

TL;DR: This review synthesizes experimental and theoretical advances in robust quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG)/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) systems, covering quantized topological phases, moiré-interaction mechanisms, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discovery of QAH effect in RMG/hBN provides a highly versatile platform for correlated topological matter, requiring a comprehensive synthesis of rapid experimental expansion (from trilayer Chern insulators to thicker quantized QAH states) and theoretical understanding of interaction-driven topological phases.

Method: Comprehensive review integrating experimental hallmarks, theoretical frameworks (continuum models, many-body approaches), and physical reconciliation of electron interactions, displacement fields, and moiré potentials.

Result: Experimentally confirmed quantized QAH states in thicker RMG systems beyond initial trilayer Chern insulators; theoretically identified cooperative roles of moiré potential and electron interactions, including prediction of interaction-driven anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) phase.

Conclusion: RMG/hBN systems are positioned at the forefront of topological quantum matter; outstanding open questions and future research directions focus on resolving theoretical-experimental discrepancies and exploring novel interaction-driven topological phases.

Abstract: The recent discovery of robust quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has established a highly versatile platform for correlated topological matter. This review synthesizes the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these interaction-driven topological phases. Experimentally, the landscape has rapidly expanded from initial Chern insulators in trilayer systems to fully quantized QAH states in thicker systems. Theoretically, it is believed that moiré potential and electron-electron interaction cooperate and produce the QAH effect in such systems. Theoretical calculations also bring interesting questions, such as the formation of an interaction-driven topological phase known as an anomalous Hall crystal (AHC). This review comprehensively covers the experimental hallmarks, the theoretical frameworks, including continuum models and many-body approaches, and the ensuing physical picture that reconciles the roles of interactions, displacement fields, and the moiré potentials. We conclude by outlining outstanding open questions and future directions, positioning RMG/hBN systems at the forefront of topological quantum matter.

*Takayuki Yokoyama,Yasuhiro Tada*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A gap-diagnostic scheme using polarization amplitude via twist operators in iDMRG framework effectively distinguishes gapless from gapped phases in quantum spin liquids, as demonstrated in XXZ chains and XY-Jχ models on square lattices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying whether a many-body ground state is gapped or gapless is fundamental but challenging, especially in quantum spin liquids where traditional methods may fail.

Method: Developed a scheme based on polarization amplitude defined via twist operators, evaluated using infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations.

Result: The polarization amplitude successfully distinguished gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid from gapped Néel phase in XXZ chains, and detected the transition between gapless XY phase and gapped chiral spin liquid phase in XY-Jχ models on infinite square lattice cylinders.

Conclusion: Polarization amplitudes provide a powerful tool for diagnosing energy gaps in two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum spin liquids.

Abstract: Identifying whether a many-body ground state is gapped or gapless is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially in quantum spin liquids. In this work, we develop a gap-diagnostic scheme based on the polarization amplitude defined via a twist operator, evaluated within the infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) framework. As a benchmark, analysis of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain demonstrates that the polarization amplitude clearly distinguishes the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid from the gapped Néel phase. We then extend this framework to infinite cylinders of the spin-$1/2$ XY-$J_χ$ model on the square lattice. We find that the polarization amplitude sharply detects the transition between the gapless XY phase and the gapped chiral spin liquid phase. These results show that polarization amplitudes provide a strong energy-gap diagnostic in two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum spin liquids.

Motivation: 发展早期关于费米面拓扑结构(FST)变化相关的量子相变理论，在可解的相互作用费米子模型中验证和应用该理论框架。

Method: 分析d=1,2,3维的可解Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK)模型；探索Lee-Yang零点、Luttinger定理和plateau (Oshikawa)定理之间的关系；应用同调论将FST转变分析为Morse函数的临界点；使用欧拉示性数量化FST。

Result: 证实Luttinger定理在HK模型中成立；FST序参量和普适类可描述金属-能带/Mott绝缘体转变以及Lifshitz和van Hove无间隙-无间隙转变；确定无间隙相为Landau费米液体(金属)；计算了HK模型各相的欧拉示性数。

Conclusion: 在临界点非退化的条件下，FST普适类对相互作用和其他模型细节具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: The earlier theory [1] of the quantum phase transitions related to the change of the Fermi Surface Topology (FST) is advanced. For such transitions the Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold determined by the Lee-Yang zeros, the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ as the $d$-volume of the Fermi sea, and the special FST universality class were introduced in [1]. The exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) $d$-dimensional ($d=1,2,3$) model of interacting fermions is analyzed. We explore the relation between the Lee-Yang zeros, the Luttinger and the plateau (Oshikawa) theorems. The validity of the Luttinger theorem in the HK model is confirmed. It is shown that the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ and the FST universality class describe the transitions between metal and band/Mott insulators, as well as the Lifshitz and van Hove gapless-to-gapless transitions. The gapless phases are established to be the Landau Fermi liquids (metals). In addition to the conventional paradigm with a continuous order parameter, we apply the homology theory to analyze the FST transitions. They are critical points of the Morse function. To quantify FST we use the Euler characteristic, which is calculated for each phase of the HK model. We claim that the FST universality class is robust with respect to interactions and other model details, under the condition that the critical points are non-degenerate.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper reveals the hierarchical energy pathways of non-thermal magnons in photoexcited CuO using time-resolved X-ray techniques, showing femtosecond generation, picosecond quasi-thermalization, and nanosecond recovery of magnons, with recovery bottlenecks caused by quasiparticle dispersion mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of momentum-resolved access to low-energy magnons governing ultrafast microscopic dynamics in magnetic materials.

Method: Time-resolved resonant diffuse scattering combined with complementary time-resolved X-ray techniques and quantum-kinetic simulations.

Result: Observation of near-instantaneous spin disorder generating non-thermal magnons within femtoseconds, followed by picosecond magnon quasi-thermalization and nanosecond recovery via momentum-selective magnon-phonon scattering, with recovery bottlenecks due to quasiparticle dispersion mismatch.

Conclusion: This microscopic framework transcends phenomenological models and provides generalizable design principles for ultrafast control of material properties across different materials.

Abstract: Energy flows among coupled subsystems are essential for ultrafast dynamics and high-speed technologies. In magnetic materials, spin fluctuations -- magnons -- mediate these flows in ultrafast magnetism. Yet momentum-resolved access to low-energy magnons governing the microscopic dynamics has been lacking. Using time-resolved resonant diffuse scattering alongside complementary time-resolved X-ray techniques and quantum-kinetic simulations, we unveil the hierarchical energy pathways among correlated systems in the photoexcited antiferromagnet CuO. Above-bandgap excitation triggers near-instantaneous spin disorder, generating non-thermal magnons throughout reciprocal space within femtoseconds. Real-time momentum-resolved tracking reveals picosecond magnon quasi-thermalization, followed by nanosecond recovery via momentum-selective magnon-phonon scattering. The quasiparticle dispersion mismatch creates recovery bottlenecks that control non-equilibrium lifetimes. This microscopic framework transcends phenomenological models and generalizes across materials, establishing design principles for ultrafast control of material properties.

TL;DR: 本研究将共振能级模型与强相互作用的SYK电子浴耦合，发现其杂质轨道占据呈现温度依赖的振荡衰减，而非传统非相互作用费米气体浴中的温度无关指数衰减。这种差异归因于SYK模型缺乏准粒子和其在费米能级处的奇异态密度。通过映射到辅助结构化费米气体浴，获得了精确的解析结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 已有研究主要关注非相互作用费米气体浴，其杂质占据呈现温度无关的指数衰减。而对于强相互作用系统（如SYK模型），准粒子图像失效，需要理解其对非平衡动力学的影响，这是研究动机。

Method: 采用映射方法，将复杂的SYK浴模型转化为一个结构化的费米气体浴作为辅助模型，从而获得精确解析解。

Result: 发现了温度依赖的振荡衰减行为，与传统的温度无关指数衰减形成鲜明对比。SYK模型缺乏准粒子且费米能级处存在奇异态密度是导致这种差异的根本原因。

Conclusion: 强相互作用浴的动力学行为与非相互作用系统有本质区别。SYK模型的特殊性质（无准粒子、奇异DOS）导致了新的衰减模式。该映射方法为研究强关联体系提供了有效的解析工具。

Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a resonant level model coupled to a strongly interacting electron bath modeled by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Different from the well-investigated case of a structureless non-interacting Fermi gas bath leading to a temperature-independent exponential decay of the impurity orbital occupation, we find a temperature-dependent oscillatory decay. We attribute this difference to the lack of quasiparticles in the SYK model, which is reflected in its singular density of states at the Fermi level. Our results are exact and can be obtained analytically by mapping to a suitably structured Fermi gas bath as an ancillary model for the SYK bath.

TL;DR: 提出NP-S框架证明NP完全问题的多层扩展在多项式层级和PSPACE中的完备性，统一并扩展了已有结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然优化问题的多层扩展（如博弈、鲁棒优化）涉及交替量词，位于多项式层级或PSPACE，但缺乏通用的完备性证明方法

Method: 定义"带解的NP"（NP-S）类及解嵌入归约，证明经典NP完全问题（如团、顶点覆盖）属于NP-S，并建立k层扩展的Σ_k^p完备性元定理

Result: NP-S问题两层的扩展为Σ₂^p-完备，三层为Σ₃^p-完备，k层为Σ_k^p-完备，无界层数为PSPACE-完备，涵盖几乎所有已知结果并产生新结论

Conclusion: 多层扩展NP问题的计算复杂性是普适特征，NP-S框架为高阶完备性证明提供通用工具

Abstract: Many natural optimization problems derived from $\sf NP$ admit bilevel and multilevel extensions in which decisions are made sequentially by multiple players with conflicting objectives, as in interdiction, adversarial selection, and adjustable robust optimization. Such problems are naturally modeled by alternating quantifiers and, therefore, lie beyond $\sf NP$, typically in the polynomial hierarchy or $\sf PSPACE$. Despite extensive study of these problem classes, relatively few natural completeness results are known at these higher levels. We introduce a general framework for proving completeness in the polynomial hierarchy and $\sf PSPACE$ for problems derived from $\sf NP$. Our approach is based on a refinement of $\sf NP$, which we call $\sf NP$ with solutions ($\sf NP$-$\sf S$), in which solutions are explicit combinatorial objects, together with a restricted class of reductions -- solution-embedding reductions -- that preserve solution structure. We define $\sf NP$-$\sf S$-completeness and show that a large collection of classical $\sf NP$-complete problems, including Clique, Vertex Cover, Knapsack, and Traveling Salesman, are $\sf NP$-$\sf S$-complete.
  Using this framework, we establish general meta-theorems showing that if a problem is $\sf NP$-$\sf S$-complete, then its natural two-level extensions are $Σ_2^p$-complete, its three-level extensions are $Σ_3^p$-complete, and its $k$-level extensions are $Σ_k^p$-complete. When the number of levels is unbounded, the resulting problems are $\sf PSPACE$-complete. Our results subsume nearly all previously known completeness results for multilevel optimization problems derived from $\sf NP$ and yield many new ones simultaneously, demonstrating that high computational complexity is a generic feature of multilevel extensions of $\sf NP$-complete problems.

*Niels Holtgrefe,Jannik Schestag,Norbert Zeh*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在考虑捕食者-猎物生态依赖关系下的系统发育多样性最大化问题（α-PDD）的参数化复杂性。主要结论包括：该问题在解大小k或多样性阈值D参数化下是W[1]-难的，但在食物网的顶点覆盖数参数化下是固定参数可解的（FPT）；最重要的是，证明α-PDD在顶点覆盖数加多样性阈值的参数化下不存在多项式核，即使系统发育树是星形结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统系统发育多样性最大化问题忽略了生态依赖关系——如果捕食者的猎物未被保存，保存该捕食者是徒劳的。因此需要在考虑食物网约束下选择k个物种，使得每个被保存的物种至少有一定比例α的猎物也被保存。

Method: 采用参数化复杂性分析方法，研究α-PDD问题在多种参数（解大小k、多样性阈值D、顶点覆盖数、距离至团等）下的计算难度。通过归约技术证明W[1]-困难性和核下界。

Result: 1) 问题在k、D或其补参数化下是W[1]-难的，属于XP类；2) 在食物网顶点覆盖数参数化下是FPT；3) 1-PDD在距离至团参数化下存在线性核；4) 主要成果：α-PDD在顶点覆盖数+D的参数化下不存在多项式核。

Conclusion: α-PDD问题在大多数自然参数化下计算困难，仅在某些结构参数（如顶点覆盖数）下可解，但无法获得高效的多项式核。这为该问题的算法设计和近似提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In the Maximize Phylogenetic Diversity problem, we are given a phylogenetic tree that represents the genetic proximity of species, and we are asked to select a subset of species of maximum phylogenetic diversity to be preserved through conservation efforts, subject to budgetary constraints that allow only k species to be saved. This neglects that it is futile to preserve a predatory species if we do not also preserve at least a subset of the prey it feeds on. Thus, in the Optimizing PD with Dependencies ($ε$-PDD) problem, we are additionally given a food web that represents the predator-prey relationships between species. The goal is to save a set of k species of maximum phylogenetic diversity such that for every saved species, at least one of its prey is also saved. This problem is NP-hard even when the phylogenetic tree is a star. The $α$-PDD problem alters PDD by requiring that at least some fraction $α$ of the prey of every saved species are also saved. In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of $α$-PDD. We prove that the problem is W[1]-hard and in XP when parameterized by the solution size k, the diversity threshold D, or their complements. When parameterized by the vertex cover number of the food web, $α$-PDD is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). A key measure of the computational difficulty of a problem that is FPT is the size of the smallest kernel that can be obtained. We prove that, when parameterized by the distance to clique, 1-PDD admits a linear kernel. Our main contribution is to prove that $α$-PDD does not admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the vertex cover number plus the diversity threshold D, even if the phylogenetic tree is a star. This implies the non-existence of a polynomial kernel for $α$-PDD also when parameterized by a range of structural parameters of the food web, such as its dist[...]

Motivation: 探索测量主导的量子芝诺 regime 中，准周期势场下连续监测如何影响量子局域化现象，建立测量诱导局域化与无序诱导局域化的理论联系。

Method: 采用双轨方法：1) 基于单量子轨迹构建自洽的有效非厄米哈密顿量解析框架，通过转移矩阵计算李雅普诺夫指数；2) 通过量子态扩散数值模拟重构本征局域波函数，分析空间衰减特性。

Result: 在量子芝诺 regime 下，理论预测与数值模拟定量吻合，局域化长度修正项精确至 J²/[λ²+(γ/2)²] 阶，验证了有效理论对测量-相干-无序相互作用的调控能力。

Conclusion: 揭示了测量诱导局域化与准周期无序局域化的协同机制，为利用测量进行量子态制备和操控奠定了理论基础，同时建立了非厄米描述与随机动力学间的桥梁。

Abstract: We investigate measurement-induced localization in a continuously monitored one-dimensional Aubry--André--Harper model, focusing on the quantum Zeno regime in which the measurements dominate coherent dynamics. The presence of a quasiperiodic potential renders the problem analytically tractable and enables a controlled study of the interplay between monitoring and disorder. We develop an analytical description based on an instantaneous Schrödinger equation with a measurement-induced effective potential constructed self-consistently from individual quantum trajectories, without relying on postselection. In the quantum Zeno regime, an emergent dominant energy scale reduces the problem to a transfer-matrix formulation of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which allows direct computation of the Lyapunov exponent. Complementarily, we extract the localization length numerically from long-time steady-state quantum state diffusion trajectories by reconstructing the intrinsic localized single-particle wave functions and analyzing their spatial decay. These numerical results show quantitative agreement with the effective theory predictions, with controlled corrections of order $J^2/[λ^2+(γ/2)^2]$ (where $J$ is the hopping amplitude, $γ$ the measurement strength, and $λ$ the quasiperiodic potential). Our results underscore the connection between the effective non-Hermitian description and the stochastic monitored dynamics, showing the interplay between Zeno-like localization, coherent hopping, and quasiperiodic-disorder-induced localization, while also laying the groundwork for understanding and exploiting measurement-induced localization as a tool for quantum control and state preparation.

*Anna Gallo,Wilfried Segnou,Timoteo Carletti*

TL;DR: Extends Turing pattern analysis to Matrix Weighted Networks (MWNs) where edge weights are matrices, showing how coherence allows reduction to scalar networks and deriving instability conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models use scalar weights or homogeneous cross-diffusion; real networks may require matrix weights to capture complex inter-node transformations.

Method: Characterizes coherent MWNs via node-dependent orthonormal matrices, enabling orthonormal variable transformation that reduces MWN diffusion to standard scalar-weighted networks.

Result: Derives Turing instability conditions for MWNs, revealing joint influence of network topology, scalar weights, and inter-node rotations on pattern formation.

Conclusion: Provides constructive framework for analyzing/designing Turing patterns on matrix-weighted and higher-order networks.

Abstract: Diffusion-driven instability is a fundamental mechanism underlying pattern formation in spatially extended systems. In almost all existing works, diffusion across the links of the underlying network is modeled through scalar weights, possibly complemented by cross-diffusion terms that are homogeneous across links. In this work, we investigate the emergence of Turing patterns on Matrix Weighted Networks (MWNs), a recently introduced framework in which each edge is associated with a matrix weight. Focusing on the class of coherent MWNs, we provide a novel characterization of coherence in terms of node-dependent orthonormal matrices, showing that link transformations can be written as relative rotations between nodes. This representation allows us to deal with coherent MWNs of any size and to introduce an orthonormal change of variables capable to reduce diffusion on a coherent MWN to diffusion on a standard weighted network with scalar weights. Building on this, we extend the classical Turing instability analysis to MWNs and derive the conditions under which a homogeneous equilibrium of the local dynamics loses stability due to matrix-weighted diffusion. Our results show how network topology, scalar weights, and inter-node transformations jointly shape pattern formation, and provide a constructive framework to analyze and design Turing patterns on matrix-weighted and higher-order networked systems.

*Till Welker,Patrick Pietzonka*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper studies the energy-accuracy trade-off for a propelled particle navigating to stay localized near a target against thermal noise and flow without feedback, revealing that optimal control requires discontinuous switching between passive and active states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the energetic cost for self-propelled particles to maintain proximity to a stationary target despite thermal noise and constant flow, and understand the fundamental trade-offs between control accuracy and energy expenditure in noisy environments.

Method: Finite-time optimal control theory applied to a particle with time-dependent swim velocity and diffusivity, optimizing protocols without feedback to minimize mean squared deviation from the target under energy constraints.

Result: A trade-off between accuracy (mean squared deviation) and energetic cost is identified; accuracy beyond a threshold requires active driving with diffusivity control. Optimal protocols involve discontinuous switching between passive drift (zero diffusivity) and active propulsion states.

Conclusion: Time-dependent diffusivity is crucial for optimal control, establishing benchmarks for artificial particles. Active driving incurs increasing energy cost for higher accuracy, complementing known stochastic thermodynamics trade-offs. Discontinuous protocols highlight efficiency of non-smooth control strategies.

Abstract: How much work does it cost for a propelled particle to stay localised near a stationary target, defying both thermal noise and a constant flow that would carry it away? We study the control of such a particle in finite time and find optimal protocols for time-dependent swim velocity and diffusivity, without feedback. Accuracy, quantified via the mean squared deviation from the target, and energetic cost turn out to be related by a trade-off, which complements the one between precision and cost known in stochastic thermodynamics. We show that accuracy better than a certain threshold requires active driving, which comes at a cost that increases with accuracy. The optimal protocols have discontinuous swim velocity and diffusivity, switching between a passive drift state with vanishing diffusivity and an active propulsion state. This study highlights how a time-dependent diffusivity enhances optimal control and sets benchmarks for cost and accuracy of artificial self-propelled particles navigating noisy environments.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了从实验波形数据定量预测振幅动力学相关的同步转变，为复杂系统同步研究提供新工具

Abstract: We present a data-driven framework to infer phase-amplitude equations of coupled limit-cycle oscillators directly from waveform measurements. Exploiting the universality of the Stuart-Landau normal form near a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, we reconstruct a near-identity transformation from two independent observables of an isolated oscillator and infer the intrinsic Stuart-Landau parameters. Using this reconstructed transformation, we then estimate linear coupling coefficients from paired measurements. The method accurately recovers parameters for coupled van der Pol oscillators, providing a quantitative benchmark. Applied to a high-dimensional hydrodynamic system of two coupled collapsible-channel oscillators, the inferred Stuart-Landau model captures bistability between in-phase and anti-phase synchronization and reveals that the anti-phase state is destabilized through a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Our approach enables quantitative prediction of synchronization transitions involving amplitude dynamics from experimentally accessible waveform data.
