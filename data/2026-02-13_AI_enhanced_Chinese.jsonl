Focusing on unsupervised learning of distributions, we show that autoregressive neural networks fail to learn global properties of distributions characterized by locally indistinguishable (LI) states. We demonstrate that conditional mutual information (CMI) is a useful diagnostic for LI: we show that for classical distributions, long-range CMI of a state implies a spatially LI partner. By introducing a restricted statistical query model, we prove that nontrivial phases with long-range CMI, such as strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking phases, are hard to learn. We validate our claims by using recurrent, convolutional, and Transformer neural networks to learn the syndrome and physical distributions of toric/surface code under bit flip noise. Our findings suggest hardness of learning as a diagnostic tool for detecting mixed-state phases and transitions and error-correction thresholds, and they suggest CMI and more generally ``non-local Gibbsness'' as metrics for how hard a distribution is to learn.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u5728\u5b78\u7fd2\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u6df7\u5408\u614b\u7269\u8cea\u76f8\u6642\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u8a08\u7b97\u56f0\u96e3\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u81ea\u56de\u6b78\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u7d61\u7121\u6cd5\u5b78\u7fd2\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u53ef\u5340\u5206\u72c0\u614b\u7684\u5206\u4f48\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u6027\u3002\u4ee5\u689d\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u70ba\u8a3a\u65b7\u6307\u6a19\uff0c\u4e26\u5728 toric/surface \u91cf\u5b50\u7cfe\u932f\u78bc\u4e0a\u5be6\u8b49\u9a57\u8b49\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b78\u7fd2\u96e3\u5ea6\u53ef\u4f5c\u70ba\u6aa2\u6e2c\u6df7\u5408\u614b\u76f8\u8b8a\u548c\u932f\u8aa4\u95be\u503c\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u8b58\u5225\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c07\u8a08\u7b97\u96e3\u5ea6\u8207\u6df7\u5408\u614b\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u806f\u7e6b\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u70ba\u4f55\u67d0\u4e9b\u5206\u4f48\u96e3\u4ee5\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u4e26\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u95dc\u4fc2\u6aa2\u6e2c\u6df7\u5408\u614b\u76f8\u548c\u76f8\u8b8a\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8ad6\u4e0a\uff1a\u8b49\u660e\u9577\u7a0b\u689d\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u610f\u5473\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u53ef\u5340\u5206\u72c0\u614b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u9650\u7d71\u8a08\u67e5\u8a62\u6a21\u578b\u8b49\u660e\u5b78\u7fd2\u96e3\u5ea6\uff1b\u5be6\u9a57\u4e0a\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528RNN\u3001CNN\u548cTransformer\u5b78\u7fd2 toric/surface \u78bc\u5728\u6bd4\u7279\u7ffb\u8f49\u566a\u8072\u4e0b\u7684\u75c7\u5019\u7fa4\u8207\u7269\u7406\u5206\u4f48\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u6df7\u5408\u614b\u76f8\u82e5\u5177\u9577\u7a0b\u689d\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5247\u8a08\u7b97\u4e0a\u96e3\u4ee5\u5b78\u7fd2\uff1b\u81ea\u56de\u6b78\u7db2\u7d61\u5728LI\u72c0\u614b\u5206\u4f48\u4e0a\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u5f37\u5f31\u81ea\u767c\u5c0d\u7a31\u6027\u7834\u7f3a\u76f8\u7279\u5225\u96e3\u5b78\u7fd2\uff1bCMI\u53ef\u4f5c\u70ba\u5b78\u7fd2\u96e3\u5ea6\u8a3a\u65b7\u6307\u6a19\uff1b\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfe\u932f\u78bc\u5be6\u9a57\u4e2d\u9a57\u8b49\u7406\u8ad6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b78\u7fd2\u96e3\u5ea6\u53ef\u4f5c\u70ba\u6aa2\u6e2c\u6df7\u5408\u614b\u76f8\u3001\u76f8\u8b8a\u548c\u932f\u8aa4\u7cfe\u6b63\u95be\u503c\u7684\u8a3a\u65b7\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u689d\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u300c\u975e\u5c40\u90e8Gibbs\u6027\u300d\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u4f48\u5b78\u7fd2\u96e3\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

The observation noise covariance of a Bayesian filter is modulated by the local value of a known or assumed potential energy function: observations are trusted when the state is near a potential minimum and progressively discounted as it approaches the barrier separating metastable wells. This physics-based mechanism differs from purely statistical robust filters, which treat all regions of state space identically, and from constrained filters, which impose hard bounds on states rather than modulating observation trust. We implement the gating within Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, and Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters, requiring only two additional hyperparameters. Synthetic benchmarks on a Ginzburg-Landau double-well process with 10% outlier contamination and Monte Carlo validation over 100 replications show 57-80% RMSE improvement over the standard Extended Kalman Filter, all statistically significant (p < 10^{-15}, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). A naive topological baseline using only distance to the nearest well achieves 57%, confirming that the continuous energy landscape adds an additional ~21 percentage points. The method is robust to misspecification: even when assumed potential parameters deviate by 50% from their true values, improvement never falls below 47%. Comparing externally forced and spontaneous Kramers-type transitions, gating retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions whereas the naive baseline degrades to 30%. As an empirical illustration, we apply the framework to Dansgaard-Oeschger events in the NGRIP delta-18O ice-core record, estimating asymmetry parameter gamma = -0.109 (bootstrap 95% CI: [-0.220, -0.011], excluding zero) and demonstrating that outlier fraction explains 91% of the variance in filter improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "Potential-energy gating is a physics-based robust state estimation method that modulates observation trust by potential energy landscape, achieving 57-80% RMSE improvement in double-well stochastic systems.", "motivation": "To develop a physics-based robust filtering method for double-well stochastic systems that modulates observation trust based on potential energy location, overcoming limitations of statistical robust filters (uniform treatment) and constrained filters (hard bounds).", "method": "Potential-energy gating modulates observation noise covariance by local potential energy function value, implemented in EKF, UKF, EnKF, AKF and particle filters with only two additional hyperparameters.", "result": "Synthetic benchmarks show 57-80% RMSE improvement over standard EKF (p<10^-15), outperforms naive baseline by ~21 percentage points, remains robust to 50% parameter misspecification (>47% improvement), retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions, and successfully estimates Dansgaard-Oeschger asymmetry parameter gamma=-0.109 (95% CI excludes zero) with outlier fraction explaining 91% of improvement variance.", "conclusion": "Potential-energy gating provides significant, robust performance gains for state estimation in double-well systems and demonstrates practical value for real-world applications like climate event analysis."}}

Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\\geq80\\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $\u03b1$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $\u03b1$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts.

Despite their advantages for scalable computing, their implementations come with surprisingly large energetic costs. This challenge has revitalized scientific and engineering interest in energy-efficient information-processing designs. One current paradigm -- dynamical computing -- controls the location and shape of minima in potential energy landscapes that are connected to a thermal environment. The landscape supports distinguishable metastable energy minima that serve as a system's mesoscopic memory states. Information is represented by microstate distributions. Dynamically manipulating the memory states then corresponds to information processing. This framing provides a natural description of the associated thermodynamic transformations and required resources. Appealing to bifurcation theory, a computational protocol in the metastable regime can be analyzed by tracking the evolution of fixed points in the state space. We illustrate the paradigm's capabilities by performing 1-bit and 2-bit computations with double-well and quadruple-well potentials, respectively.

W. Moll", "Subir Sachdev", "Pavel A. Nosov"], "title": "Sondheimer magneto-oscillations as a probe of Fermi surface reconstruction in underdoped cuprates", "comment": "15 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "Determining the Fermi surface (FS) volume in underdoped cuprates is crucial for understanding the nature of the strongly correlated pseudogap phase. Conventional quantum oscillation techniques, typically used for this purpose, are inapplicable in this high-temperature regime due to thermal and disorder-induced smearing of Landau levels. We propose Sondheimer oscillations (SO), semiclassical oscillations of in-plane magnetoresistivity in thin films, as a robust alternative probe of FS reconstruction. SO arise from the commensuration between the cyclotron radius and film thickness, do not rely on Landau quantization, and remain observable at moderate fields and elevated temperatures where quantum oscillations are suppressed. Their frequencies depend solely on the FS parameters (e.g., curvature), and not on specific details of scattering mechanisms. SO are also sensitive to the coherence of inter-layer tunneling, allow contributions from individual FS pockets to be distinguished in the frequency domain, and naturally include the Yamaji angle effect (if present in the system) as a prominent feature in the frequency spectrum. We compute SO spectra as a function of the magnetic field orientation for three representative scenarios: (i) an unreconstructed large FS, (ii) a spin density wave reconstructed FS with volume $p/4$, and (iii) a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL$^*$) with pocket volume $p/8$ (here $p$ is the hole doping). We show that the SO spectrum offers a wealth of universal features that could be used to differentiate between these scenarios. In particular, we highlight a FS geometry-dependent phase shift between oscillations in longitudinal and transverse conductivities, characterize how the FS curvature can be extracted from SO if the film orientation is perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$-axis, and analyze the evolution of the SO spectrum with doping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSondheimer\u632f\u8361\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u6b20\u63ba\u6742\u94dc\u9178\u76d0\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8584\u819c\u4e2d\u56de\u65cb\u534a\u5f84\u4e0e\u539a\u5ea6\u7684\u5339\u914d\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e2d\u7b49\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u91cd\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8c31\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u8d5d\u80fd\u9699\u76f8\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u9700\u8981\u6d4b\u5b9a\u6b20\u63ba\u6742\u94dc\u9178\u76d0\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u632f\u8361\u6280\u672f\u56e0\u70ed\u548c\u6742\u8d28\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6717\u9053\u80fd\u7ea7\u5c55\u5bbd\u5728\u6b64\u9ad8\u6e29\u533a\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8584\u819c\u4e2d\u9762\u5185\u78c1\u963b\u7684Sondheimer\u632f\u8361\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u6e90\u4e8e\u56de\u65cb\u534a\u5f84\u4e0e\u819c\u539a\u7684\u5339\u914d\uff09\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e09\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u672a\u91cd\u6784\u5927\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u3001\u81ea\u65cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u5206\u6570\u5316\u8d39\u7c73\u6db2\u4f53\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u78c1\u573a\u53d6\u5411\u4e0bSO\u9891\u8c31\u3002", "result": "1) \u7eb5\u5411\u4e0e\u6a2a\u5411\u7535\u5bfc\u632f\u8361\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u5dee\uff1b2) \u53ef\u5782\u76f4c\u8f74\u53d6\u5411\u4e0b\u4eceSO\u63d0\u53d6\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u66f2\u7387\uff1b3) \u63ba\u6742\u6f14\u5316\u8c31\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u533a\u5206p/4\u4e0ep/8\u4f53\u79ef\u53e3\u888b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6307\u7eb9\u3002", "conclusion": "Sondheimer\u632f\u8361\u63d0\u4f9b\u666e\u9002\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u573a/\u9ad8\u6e29\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u8d5d\u80fd\u9699\u76f8\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u91cd\u6784\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u4f53\u7cfb\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a2\u9488\u3002"}}

However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation. Experiments on various MoE LLMs demonstrate that KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing quantization methods. For example, 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves an average accuracy of 67.99, nearly identical to the FP16 baseline of 68.07, underscoring KBVQ-MoE's potential for efficient deployment on edge devices and other resource-constrained platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "KBVQ-MoE is a novel vector quantization framework for MoE models that uses KLT-guided SVD for redundancy elimination and bias-corrected output stabilization to achieve ultra-low-bit compression with minimal accuracy loss.", "motivation": "MoE models have huge parameter sizes making deployment in resource-constrained environments challenging.

While circuit complexity and tensor rank coincide asymptotically for $3$-mode tensors, this correspondence breaks down for $d \\geq 4$ modes. As a result, the complexity of $d$-mode tensors for larger fixed $d$ remains poorly understood, despite its relevance, e.g., in fine-grained complexity. Our paper explores this intermediate regime. First, we give a \"graph-theoretic\" proof of Strassen's $2\u03c9/3$ bound on the asymptotic rank exponent of $3$-mode tensors. Our proof directly generalizes to an upper bound of $(d-1)\u03c9/3$ for $d$-mode tensors. Using refined techniques available only for $d\\geq 4$ modes, we improve this bound beyond the current state of the art for $\u03c9$. We also obtain a bound of $d/2+1$ on the asymptotic exponent of circuit complexity of generic $d$-mode tensors and optimized bounds for $d \\in \\{4,5\\}$. To the best of our knowledge, asymptotic circuit complexity (rather than rank) of tensors has not been studied before. To obtain a robust theory, we first ask whether low complexity of $T$ and $U$ imply low complexity of their Kronecker product $T \\otimes U$. While this crucially holds for rank (and thus for circuit complexity in $3$ modes), we show that assumptions from fine-grained complexity rule out such a submultiplicativity for the circuit complexity of tensors with many modes. In particular, assuming the Hyperclique Conjecture, this failure occurs already for $d=8$ modes. Nevertheless, we can salvage a restricted notion of submultiplicativity.

For a 400^3 domain, LIETS reduces generation time from tens of minutes for a serial CPU implementation and several minutes for vectorized CPU and GPU QSGS to about 24 s on a consumer-grade RTX 4060, achieving peak throughputs up to 2.7x10^7 nodes/s. A Fontainebleau sandstone benchmark at 500^3 resolution shows that LIETS reproduces the dependence of pore and grain size distributions on seed spacing (optimal s=30 voxels) and yields permeability-porosity trends within the experimental envelope and consistent with previously published Fast-QSGS results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u5ca9\u77f3\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5408\u6210\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684QSGS\u7b97\u6cd5\u2014\u2014LIETS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u968f\u673a\u751f\u957f\u64cd\u4f5c\u5230\u663e\u5f0f\u6d3b\u52a8\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u79cd\u5b50\u95f4\u8ddd\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u751f\u957f\u6982\u7387\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5ca9\u77f3\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5408\u6210\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u5178\u7684QSGS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u4e09\u7ef4\u7f51\u683c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5217\u8868\u7d22\u5f15\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\uff08LIETS\uff09\u7684QSGS\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u751f\u957f\u64cd\u4f5c\u9650\u5236\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u6d3b\u52a8\u524d\u6cbf\u800c\u975e\u6574\u4e2a\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Python\u7684NumPy\uff08CPU\uff09\u548cCuPy\uff08GPU\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u83f1\u5f62\u81a8\u80c0\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u95f4\u8ddd\u63a7\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u751f\u957f\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728400^3\u57df\u4e0a\uff0cLIETS\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u4e32\u884cCPU\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6570\u5341\u5206\u949f\u3001\u5411\u91cf\u5316CPU\u548cGPU QSGS\u7684\u6570\u5206\u949f\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3\u7ea624\u79d2\uff08\u5728RTX 4060\u4e0a\uff09\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u8fbe2.7\u00d710^7\u8282\u70b9/\u79d2\u3002500^3\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684Fontainebleau\u7802\u5ca9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0cLIETS\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\u5b54\u9699\u548c\u9897\u7c92\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u95f4\u8ddd\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff08\u6700\u4f18s=30\u4f53\u7d20\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8303\u56f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u4e0e\u5148\u524dFast-QSGS\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u7b26\u7684\u6e17\u900f\u7387-\u5b54\u9699\u5ea6\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "LIETS\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86QSGS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u4e09\u7ef4\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5ca9\u77f3\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Furthermore, he showed the proposal is inherently robust to local perturbations (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:1001.0344, arXiv:1001.4363) when anyons are created as quasiparticle excitations of a topologically ordered lattice model prepared at zero temperature. Over the decades following this proposal there have been considerable technological developments towards the construction of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Rather than maintaining some target ground state at zero temperature, a modern approach is to actively correct the errors a target state experiences, where we use noisy quantum circuit elements to identify and subsequently correct for deviations from the ideal state. We present an error-correction scheme that enables us to carry out robust universal quantum computation by braiding anyons. We show that our scheme can be carried out on a suitably large device with an arbitrarily small failure rate assuming circuit elements are below some threshold level of local noise. The error-corrected scheme we have developed therefore enables us to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using modern quantum hardware that is now under development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7ec7\u4efb\u610f\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u9519\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u5c0f\u7684\u6545\u969c\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u5854\u8036\u592b\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u8981\u96f6\u6e29\u57fa\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ea0\u9519\u800c\u975e\u88ab\u52a8\u7ef4\u6301\u57fa\u6001\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7ec7\u4efb\u610f\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u5143\u4ef6\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u504f\u79bb\u7406\u60f3\u6001\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efa\u3001\u7f16\u7ec7\u548c\u878d\u5408\u4efb\u610f\u5b50\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7535\u8def\u5143\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u4f4e\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e00\u9608\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u5c0f\u7684\u6545\u969c\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bb9\u9519\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6848\u4f7f\u5f97\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u9519\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We show that this spike tail separation persists throughout training, with the spike occupying only about 1.5% of directions yet dominating optimizer statistics. This dominance suppresses tail learning by contracting tail updates through second moment normalization and tightening the globally stable learning rate bound. Motivated by this analysis, we propose Spectra, a spike aware optimizer that suppresses the dominant low rank spike subspace without amplifying the noise sensitive spectral tail.

Building on ideas from static non-intrusive ROMs, specifically, Operator Inference (OpInf) and the recently-introduced Non-intrusive Trajectory-based optimization of Reduced-Order Models (NiTROM), we propose three formulations: Adaptive OpInf (sequential basis/operator refits), Adaptive NiTROM (joint Riemannian optimization of encoder/decoder and polynomial dynamics), and a hybrid that initializes NiTROM with an OpInf update. We describe the online data window, adaptation window, and computational budget, and analyze cost scaling. On a transiently perturbed lid-driven cavity flow, static Galerkin/OpInf/NiTROM drift or destabilize when forecasting beyond training. In contrast, Adaptive OpInf robustly suppresses amplitude drift with modest cost; Adaptive NiTROM is shown to attain near-exact energy tracking under frequent updates but is sensitive to its initialization and optimization depth; the hybrid is most reliable under regime changes and minimal offline data, yielding physically coherent fields and bounded energy. We argue that predictive claims for ROMs must be cost-aware and transparent, with clear separation of training/adaptation/deployment regimes and explicit reporting of online budgets and full-order model queries.

To connect robust behavior with non-trivial topological features present already in the dynamics of individual units, here we introduce the topological chiral random walker (TCRW) model. While exploring the system, a TCRW locates edges and boundaries in the system and develops topologically protected edge currents even in the presence of defects and disorder. Drawing on the bulk-boundary correspondence found in hard condensed matter systems allows us to rationalize the emergence of robust edge currents through topological features of the dynamic spectrum. We show that chiral motion and rotational noise with opposite chirality are two crucial components in our inherently non-Hermitian model. As proofs of principle, we first show that a topological walker outperforms diffusive motion to efficiently solve complex mazes due to its property of remaining on the edge with some rare detachments.

The significant MCE is observed far above long-range ordering, even in the paramagnetic region, which is attributed to the change in magnetic entropy due to short-range spin correlation arising from (low-dimensional) magnetic frustration. Such a spin-chain incipient MCE above long-range ordering is rarely reported. Interestingly, multiple magnetocaloric switching from conventional to inverse MCE (and vice versa) are observed below long-range magnetic ordering, as a function of temperature and magnetic field, for the R = Nd, Dy, and Er members. However, such MCE switching is absent in the Gd member, which is an S-state atom (orbital moment L = 0). Our systematic investigation of this series demonstrates that the interplay between crystal-electric field (CEF), strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rare earth anisotropy of R-ions play an important role in spin reorientation, leading to multiple MCE switching due to intriguing changes in magnetic and lattice entropy. The maximum change of entropy for Er, Gd, Dy and Nd is 7.8, 6.8, 4.0 and 1.0 J Kg-1 K-1 respectively.

We show that the strong $d$-wave spin-momentum locking inherent to the altermagnetic band structure reconstructs the Fermi surface into spin-selective quasi-1D open sheets. This unique topology of Fermi surface drives an instability toward spin-resolved electronic charge density waves (CDWs), in which the ordering wave vectors for spin-up and spin-down electrons condense along two mutually orthogonal directions, forming spin-resolved stripe phases. As a consequence, this results in pronounced gap openings near the Fermi surface, and the superposition of these spin-resolved stripe orders leads to a checkerboard CDW in the charge channel and an antiphase spin-density-wave modulation in the spin channel. Upon increasing temperature, the density-wave order melts at $T_c$ due to thermal phase fluctuation while the gap opening persists, giving rise to a robust pseudogap regime, which eventually closes at a higher temperature $T_g$. The resulting simulations quantitatively reproduce the key features observed in the spectroscopic measurements, offering a consistent and generic understanding of the reported phenomena in KV$_2$Se$_2$O and, more broadly, in metallic altermagnets with strong spin-momentum locking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6d3d\u5fae\u89c2\u591a\u4f53\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f3ad-wave\u81ea\u65cb-\u52a8\u91cf\u9501\u5b9a\u5982\u4f55\u4f7fKV\u2082Se\u2082O\u4e2d\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u51c6\u4e00\u7ef4\u5f00\u653e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u68cb\u76d8\u72b6\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8d5d\u80fd\u9699\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7KV\u2082Se\u2082O\u4e2d\u91d1\u5c5e\u6027d-wave altermagnetism\u6700\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u5fae\u89c2\u591a\u4f53\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3altermagnetic\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e2d\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u6709\u5e8f\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u591a\u4f53\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5de1\u6e38\u7535\u5b50altermagnetic\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e2d\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3ad-wave\u81ea\u65cb-\u52a8\u91cf\u9501\u5b9a\u5c06\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u51c6\u4e00\u7ef4\u5f00\u653e\u8584\u7247\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u9a71\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u81ea\u65cb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u7535\u5b50\u7684\u5e8f\u53c2\u91cf\u6cbf\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u65b9\u5411\u51dd\u805a\u5f62\u6210\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u6761\u7eb9\u76f8\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u660e\u663e\u80fd\u9699\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u68cb\u76d8\u72b6\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u548c\u53cd\u76f8\u4f4d\u81ea\u65cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u8c03\u5236\uff1b\u6e29\u5ea6\u5347\u9ad8\u65f6\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u5e8f\u5728T_c\u7194\u5316\u4f46\u80fd\u9699\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8d5d\u80fd\u9699\u533a\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6T_g\u5173\u95ed\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u5b9a\u91cf\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3aKV\u2082Se\u2082O\u53ca\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u81ea\u65cb-\u52a8\u91cf\u9501\u5b9a\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u6027altermagnet\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u6d3d\u4e14\u666e\u9002\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

While these diagnostics have been proposed to distinguish quantum chaos from integrability, quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians are widely expected to exhibit trivial Lanczos structure. Here we demonstrate that Lanczos coefficients generated from local boundary operators provide a quantitative diagnostic of whether the lowest excitation gap is controlled by boundary-localized or bulk-extended modes in the long-range Kitaev chain, the model for topological superconductivity with algebraically decaying couplings. We introduce \\emph{Krylov staggering parameter}, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites.

Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets.

In this work, we study charged moments within the framework of Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT). This theory describes large-scale ballistic fluctuations of conserved charges and associated currents and, by exploiting the height-field formulation of twist fields, gives access to the asymptotic behaviour of their two-point correlation functions. In Del Vecchio Del Vecchio et al. $[1]$, this approach was applied to the special case of branch-point twist fields used to compute entanglement entropies within the replica approach. Here, we extend those results by applying BFT to composite branch-point twist fields, obtained by inserting an additional gauge field. Focusing on free fermions, we derive analytic expressions for charged R\u00e9nyi entropies both at equilibrium, in generalized Gibbs ensembles, and out of equilibrium following a quantum quench from $U(1)$ preserving pair producing integrable initial states. In the latter case, our results agree with the conjecture arising from the quasiparticle picture.", "AI": {"tldr": "Extends Ballistic Fluctuation Theory to composite twist fields for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies in free fermion systems, validating quench dynamics against quasiparticle conjectures.", "motivation": "To quantify how entanglement distributes across symmetry sectors in quantum many-body systems with global internal symmetry, requiring generalized entropy measures beyond standard entanglement entropy.", "method": "Applies Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT) using height-field formulation of composite branch-point twist fields (with inserted gauge fields) to analyze charged moments' asymptotic correlations.", "result": "Derives analytic expressions for charged R\u00e9nyi entropies in free fermions: (1) at equilibrium in generalized Gibbs ensembles, (2) post-quench from U(1)-symmetric pair-producing states, matching quasiparticle picture predictions.", "conclusion": "BFT successfully computes symmetry-resolved entanglement for composite operators, bridging fluctuation theory with quantum information in both equilibrium and dynamical scenarios."}}

Any gapped phase with the full symmetry must, upon restriction to $\\mathcal{E}$, arise as the restriction of both a gapped $\\mathcal{C}$-symmetric phase and a gapped $\\mathcal{D}$-symmetric phase. When no such compatible phase exists, gaplessness is enforced. This mechanism can operate with only discrete and non-anomalous continuous symmetries in the UV, both of which admit well-understood lattice realizations.

Using the full quantum master equation and input-output formalism for two-level systems coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide and driven by a coherent field, we show that an engineered DMI enables strong nonreciprocity in an otherwise reciprocal system, with tunable behavior governed by driving strength, detunings, and phase of the DMI. Using it not only demonstrates nonreciprocal transmission but also demonstrates nonreciprocal quantum entanglement and photon bunching. The system can end up in a pure state as certain decohering channels do not participate. The pure state leads to power-independent perfect transparency. Conditions are derived and depend on the propagation phase, the relative detuning of the two qubits, and the exchange interaction. At these pure-state points, the steady-state entanglement is reciprocal and admits a closed-form expression; away from them, phase control generates strong entanglement nonreciprocity. The DMI also reshapes photon statistics, redistributing two-photon correlations and shifting superbunching from transmission (no DMI) to reflection at finite DMI. These results establish DMI as a versatile resource for engineering nonreciprocity, transparency, entanglement, and photon correlations in waveguide QED, enabling isolators, routers, and superbunching light sources without requiring chiral waveguides.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u975e\u624b\u6027\u6ce2\u5bfcQED\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u80fd\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8026\u5408\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u5149\u5b50\u805a\u675f\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u5668\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u6027\u6ce2\u5bfc\u6216\u5916\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e9f\u9700\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u975e\u624b\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e8c\u80fd\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76f8\u5e72\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e0e\u4e00\u7ef4\u6ce2\u5bfc\u8026\u5408\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "result": "DMI\u53ef\u5728\u539f\u672c\u4e92\u6613\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5f3a\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9a71\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u5931\u8c10\u548cDMI\u76f8\u4f4d\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u63a7\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6f14\u5316\u81f3\u7eaf\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4f20\u64ad\u76f8\u4f4d\u3001\u76f8\u5bf9\u5931\u8c10\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u7eaf\u6001\u70b9\u5904\u7ea0\u7f20\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u6613\u6027\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u504f\u79bb\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u7ea0\u7f20\uff1bDMI\u91cd\u5851\u5149\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u8d85\u805a\u675f\u4ece\u900f\u5c04\uff08\u65e0DMI\uff09\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u53cd\u5c04\uff08\u6709\u9650DMI\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "DMI\u4e3a\u6ce2\u5bfcQED\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u6027\u3001\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u5149\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u7684\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u6027\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u9694\u79bb\u5668\u3001\u8def\u7531\u5668\u548c\u8d85\u805a\u675f\u5149\u6e90\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Upon burning, soil on the surface or immediately beneath becomes hydrophobic, a phenomenon that occurs predominantly on sand-based hillslopes. Rainwater and eroded soil blanket the downslope, leading to catastrophic debris flows. Soil hydrophobicity enhances erosion, resulting in post-wildfire debris flows that differ from natural mudflows in intensity, duration, and destructiveness. Thus, it is crucial to understand the timing and conditions of debris-flow onset, driven by the coupled effects of critical parameters: varying rain intensities (RI), slope gradients, water-entry values, and grain sizes (D50). Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become increasingly valuable in geotechnical engineering due to their ability to model complex systems without predefined assumptions. This study applies multiple ML algorithms: multiple linear regression (MLR), logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to predict and classify outcomes from laboratory experiments that model field conditions using a rain device on various soils in sloped flumes. While MLR effectively predicted total discharge, erosion predictions were less accurate, especially for coarse sand. LR and SVC achieved good accuracy in classifying failure outcomes, supported by clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fine sand is highly susceptible to erosion, particularly under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall. Results also show that the first 10 minutes of high-intensity rain are most critical for discharge and failure. These findings highlight the potential of ML for post-wildfire hazard assessment and emergency response planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u91ce\u706b\u540e\u6ce5\u77f3\u6d41\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u964d\u96e8\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u758f\u6c34\u571f\u58e4\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u91ce\u706b\u540e\u6ce5\u77f3\u6d41\u56e0\u571f\u58e4\u758f\u6c34\u6027\u800c\u7834\u574f\u529b\u6781\u5f3a\uff0c\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u964d\u96e8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u5761\u5ea6\u3001\u5165\u6e17\u503c\u548c\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u542f\u52a8\u65f6\u673a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5143\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3001K\u5747\u503c\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u659c\u5761\u6c34\u69fd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u7ec6\u7802\u5728\u4f4e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u957f\u5386\u65f6\u964d\u96e8\u4e0b\u6700\u6613\u4fb5\u8680\uff1b\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u964d\u96e8\u524d10\u5206\u949f\u5bf9\u5f84\u6d41\u548c\u7834\u574f\u6700\u5173\u952e\uff1bMLR\u9884\u6d4b\u5f84\u6d41\u597d\u4f46\u4fb5\u8680\u4e0d\u51c6\uff0cLR\u548cSVC\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u91ce\u706b\u540e\u6ce5\u77f3\u6d41\u707e\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales.

For an even number of particles, the spectra conform to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, as expected for a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian. In stark contrast, the odd-parity sector exhibits exact double degeneracy of all eigenstates even after resolving all known symmetries, and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble accurately describes the spacing distribution between these doublets.

We introduce a fully quantum Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for ILP that implements a coherent random walk over the discrete feasible region using only reversible quantum circuits, without quantum-RAM assumptions or classical pre/post-processing. Each walk step is a unitary update that prepares coherent candidate moves, evaluates the objective and constraints reversibly -- including a constraint-satisfaction counter to enforce feasibility -- and encodes Metropolis acceptance amplitudes via a low-overhead linearized rule. At the logical level, the construction uses $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log_2 N)$ qubits to represent $n$ integer variables over the interval $[-N,\\,N-1]$, and the Toffoli-equivalent cost per Metropolis step grows linearly with the total logical qubit count. Using explicit ripple-carry adder constructions, we support linear objectives and mixed equality/inequality constraints. Numerical circuit-level simulations on a broad ensemble of randomly generated instances validate the predicted linear resource scaling and exhibit progressive thermalization toward low-cost feasible solutions under the annealing schedule. Overall, the method provides a coherent, resource-characterized baseline for fully quantum constraint programming and a foundation for incorporating additional quantum speedups in combinatorial optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u91cf\u5b50Metropolis-Hastings\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u5e72\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cf\u5b50RAM\u6216\u7ecf\u5178\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08ILP\uff09\u5728\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u7269\u6d41\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176NP\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u8d28\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5168\u91cf\u5b50Metropolis-Hastings\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5728\u79bb\u6563\u53ef\u884c\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u5e72\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\uff1b2) \u4ec5\u7528\u53ef\u9006\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cf\u5b50RAM\uff1b3) \u6bcf\u6b65\u4e3a\u5e7a\u6b63\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u76f8\u5e72\u5019\u9009\u79fb\u52a8\u51c6\u5907\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53ef\u9006\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u53ca\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7ebf\u6027\u5316Metropolis\u63a5\u53d7\u5e45\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\uff1b4) \u4f7f\u7528O(n log\u2082 N)\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u8868\u793an\u4e2a[-N,N-1]\u533a\u95f4\u6574\u6570\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b5) \u91c7\u7528\u7eb9\u6ce2\u8fdb\u4f4d\u52a0\u6cd5\u5668\u652f\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7b49\u5f0f/\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u8d44\u6e90\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1aToffoli\u7b49\u4ef7\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u5728\u968f\u673a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8d44\u6e90\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u70ed\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u9000\u706b\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7b97\u6cd5\u9010\u6b65\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u660e\u786e\u3001\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6574\u5408\u66f4\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction.

Multiple magnetic phases are identified, including a non-collinear Y phase in zero field, a field-induced collinear m = 1/3 magnetization plateau, and a high-field V phase. In the Y phase, the magnetic excitation spectrum exhibits both single-magnon excitations and an extended high-energy continuum. Both features are well described by non-linear spin wave theory. In the field-induced phases, complex effects of the spectrum renormalization even for large S = 5/2 material are clearly detectable. These results underscore the essential role of magnon-magnon interactions in the dynamics of large-S Heisenberg spin systems on a triangular lattice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d1\u73b0S=5/2\u4e09\u89d2\u6676\u683c\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53K2Mn(SeO3)2\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u78c1\u76f8\u53ca\u663e\u8457\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u5b50-\u81ea\u65cb\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5927\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\"\u7ecf\u5178\"\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u77e5", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f31\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4e09\u89d2\u6676\u683c\u5927\u81ea\u65cb(S=5/2)\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u81ea\u65cb\u6ce2\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728 supposedly \"classical\" \u5927\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u70ed\u6cd5\u3001\u78c1\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u4e2d\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u5f81K2Mn(SeO3)2\u5728\u96f6\u573a\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u76f8\u53d8\u53ca\u6fc0\u53d1\u8c31", "result": "1) \u8bc6\u522b\u96f6\u573a\u975e\u5171\u7ebfY\u76f8\u3001\u78c1\u573a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76841/3\u78c1\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\u76f8\u548c\u9ad8\u538bV\u76f8\uff1b2) Y\u76f8\u4e2d\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u5355\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u548c\u5bbd\u80fd\u57df\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\uff1b3) \u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u65cb\u6ce2\u7406\u8bba\u5b9a\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b4) \u53d1\u73b0\u5927S=5/2\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u8c31\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u6548\u5e94", "conclusion": "\u78c1\u632f\u5b50-\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u4e09\u89d2\u6676\u683c\u5927\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u8d77\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u6548\u5e94\u5728S=5/2\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4e0d\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u4fee\u6b63\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5927\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u671f"}}

For a protocol for a task in QIT, we call a protocol LU invariant if two LU-equivalent states are either both suitable for the protocol or neither is. So far, no one has discussed whether a protocol for a task in QIT is LU invariant. In [Phys. Rev. A, 74, 062320 (2006)], Agrawal and Pati proposed the perfect teleportation protocol (PTP) and the protocol for superdense coding to transmit 2-bit classical information by sending one qubit (PSDC-2) and 3-bit classical information by sending two qubits (PSDC-3). In this paper, we show that PTP and PSDC-2 are LU invariant. That is, two LU equivalent states are suitable for PTP and PSDC-2 or neither of them is. We show that PSDC-3 is not LU invariant. We also indicate that the teleportation proposed in <cite>Nielsen</cite> is not LU invariant. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a state to be suitable for PTP, PSDC-2, and PSDC-3, respectively. Via the LU invariance of PTP and PSDC-2, we prove that a state is suitable for PTP and PSDC-2 if and only if it has 1 ebit of shared entanglement, respectively and find all genuine entangled states and separable states which are suitable for PTP and PSDC-2, respectively. So far, no one has indicated that PTP and PSDC-2 do not require genuine entanglement. Agrawal and Pati suggested to study if there are subclasses of W SLOCC class which are suitable for PSDC-3. So far, it still remains an unsolved question. We show that any state of the SLOCC class W is not suitable for PSDC-3.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u534f\u8bae\u7684LU\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Agrawal-Pati\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u9690\u5f62\u4f20\u6001(PTP)\u548c2\u6bd4\u7279\u8d85\u5bc6\u7f16\u7801(PSDC-2)\u662fLU\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\uff0c\u800c3\u6bd4\u7279\u8d85\u5bc6\u7f16\u7801(PSDC-3)\u548cNielsen\u9690\u5f62\u4f20\u6001\u4e0d\u662f\u3002\u7ed9\u51fa\u72b6\u6001\u9002\u7528\u4e8ePTP\u3001PSDC-2\u548cPSDC-3\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u6b64\u5f97\u51faPTP\u548cPSDC-2\u4ec5\u9700\u89811 ebit\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u548c\u53ef\u5206\u6001\u4e2d\u6ee1\u8db3\u8be5\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5747\u88ab\u5217\u51fa\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bc1\u660eW\u7c7bSLOCC\u6001\u5747\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8ePSDC-3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u5e7a\u6b63(LU)\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u91cf\u5e76\u80fd\u5b8c\u6210\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u82e5\u4e00\u4e2a\u534f\u8bae\u5bf9\u4efb\u610fLU\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8981\u4e48\u90fd\u9002\u7528\u3001\u8981\u4e48\u90fd\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u5219\u79f0\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u4e3aLU\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u6b64\u524d\u5c1a\u672a\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5177\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u534f\u8bae\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907LU\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002Agrawal\u548cPati\u57282006\u5e74\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b8c\u7f8e\u9690\u5f62\u4f20\u6001(PTP)\u548c\u4e24\u7c7b\u8d85\u5bc6\u7f16\u7801(PSDC-2\u3001PSDC-3)\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u68c0\u9a8c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u534f\u8bae\u7684LU\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u523b\u753b\u9002\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u5e7a\u6b63\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ea0\u7f20\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08ebits\uff09\u548cSLOCC\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51faPTP\u3001PSDC-2\u548cPSDC-3\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5229\u7528LU\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faPTP\u548cPSDC-2\u4ec5\u9700\u89811 ebit\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5217\u51fa\u6240\u6709\u6ee1\u8db3\u8be5\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u771f\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u548c\u53ef\u5206\u6001\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u68c0\u9a8cW\u7c7bSLOCC\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9PSDC-3\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "1.

While several defense methods have been explored recently, they rely primarily on task-specific adversarial fine-tuning, which inevitably limits generalizability and causes catastrophic forgetting and deteriorates benign performance. Different with previous works, we propose a more rigorous defense goal that requires only a single tuning for diverse downstream tasks to defend against DAEs and preserve benign performance. To achieve this defense goal, we introduce Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense (ZePAD), which is inspired by the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to data characteristics. Specifically, ZePAD is a dual-branch structure, which consists of a Multi-Pattern Adversarial Enhancement Branch (MPAE-Branch) that uses two adversarially fine-tuned encoders to strengthen adversarial resistance. The Benign Memory Preservation Branch (BMP-Branch) is trained on local data to ensure adversarial robustness does not compromise benign performance. Surprisingly, we find that ZePAD can directly detect DAEs by evaluating branch confidence, without introducing any adversarial exsample identification task during training. Notably, by enriching feature diversity, our method enables a single adversarial fine-tuning to defend against DAEs across downstream tasks, thereby achieving persistent robustness.

Quantum synchronization provides one such example of ergodicity breaking, but previous studies have focused on open systems. Here, motivated by the problem of ergodicity breaking in closed systems and the study of non-trivial dynamics, we investigate synchronization in a closed disordered Heisenberg spin chain. In the presence of large random disorder, strongly breaking the permutation symmetry of the system, we observe the emergence of spatial synchronization, where spins lock into locally synchronized patches. This behavior can be interpreted as a fragmentation of the global dynamical symmetry $S^+$ into a collection of local dynamical symmetries, each characterized by a distinct frequency. In the weak-disorder regime, still without permutation symmetry, we show that the synchronization mechanism can be understood perturbatively within Krylov space. In the absence of disorder, the Krylov space associated with the dynamical symmetry $S^+$ is two-dimensional. Introducing disorder couples this subspace to the remainder of the Krylov space. This coupling leads only to a second-order correction to the frequency of the dynamical symmetry, thereby preserving coherent oscillations despite the presence of small disorder. At stronger disorder, the perturbation modifies $S^+$ so that it acquires a finite lifetime, providing an example of a transient dynamical symmetry.", "AI": {"tldr": "Closed disordered Heisenberg spin chains exhibit disorder-induced spatial synchronization and ergodicity breaking via fragmentation of global dynamical symmetry into local symmetries.", "motivation": "Previous studies of quantum synchronization focused on open systems; this work investigates synchronization as a mechanism for ergodicity breaking in *closed* quantum many-body systems, motivated by understanding non-trivial dynamics and thermalization avoidance.", "method": "Analyzed a closed disordered Heisenberg spin chain using Krylov space perturbation theory, varying disorder strength to study symmetry breaking (permutation symmetry) and dynamical symmetry (S\u207a) evolution.", "result": "(1) Strong disorder breaks permutation symmetry, causing spatial synchronization (spins lock into locally synchronized patches) interpreted as fragmentation of global symmetry S\u207a into local dynamical symmetries.

While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

On each leaf we construct the least-biased state compatible with normalization and mean energy, defining a leaf-canonical ensemble. The Gibbs ensemble is recovered on the distinguished commuting leaf, while generic states are organized by their leaf label. This structure provides a natural setting to extend eigenstate thermalization beyond equilibrium via a \"leaf typicality\" hypothesis.

In conventional trapped-ion schemes, realizing a well-defined, coherent gate typically requires spectrally addressing a specific bus mode. As the ion number increases, the coupling to each individual motional mode becomes weaker, so gates on large ion strings mediated by a single mode are necessarily slow. Moreover, addressing a large number of modes demands complex driving schemes, and the fundamentally perturbative character of these approaches imposes constraints on achievable gate speed and fidelity.\n  Here, we introduce a scheme for entangling trapped-ion qubits using a time-dependent magnetic-field gradient, in which all axial motional modes participate in mediating the interaction and the gate construction is nonperturbative. The framework can be used to implement both multi-qubit gates and two-qubit gates between arbitrary pairs in a linear ion string.

Here, we explore the Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators and argue that the combination of the intrinsic spin-lattice coupling and the spin exchanges could induce the topological mechanics with topological boundary floppy modes in the phonon spectra. This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagom\u00e9 lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes.

However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping.

However, conventional MD is fundamentally limited by the high computational cost required to generate independent samples. Generative molecular dynamics (GenMD) has recently emerged as an alternative, learning surrogates of molecular distributions either from data or through interaction with energy models. While these methods enable efficient sampling, their transferability across molecular systems is often limited. In this work, we show that incorporating auxiliary sources of information can improve the data efficiency and generalization of transferable implicit transfer operators (TITO) for molecular dynamics. We find that coarse-grained TITO models are substantially more data-efficient than Boltzmann Emulators, and that incorporating protein language model (pLM) embeddings further improves out-of-distribution generalization. Our approach, PLaTITO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on equilibrium sampling benchmarks for out-of-distribution protein systems, including fast-folding proteins.

We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks.

In particular, we identify two qualitatively different approaches to gauging qLDPC codes to obtain their non-Abelian counterparts. The first approach applies to codes that exhibit a generalized form of Poincar\u00e9 duality and leads to a qLDPC non-Abelian Clifford stabilizer code, whose stabilizers are reminiscent of the action of a Type-III twisted quantum double. Our second approach applies to general qLDPC codes, and uses a graph of ancilla qubits which may be tailored to properties of the input codes to gauge a single transversal gate.

When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection.

However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7edf\u4e00\u4e8e\u5e76\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fb9\u5904\u7406\u8fb9\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534723.9%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u6216\u9759\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bb0\u5f55\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u540c\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u4f7f\u5e73\u5747\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1123.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd0\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9010\u6b65\u8fdb\u5316\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fb9\u5904\u7406\u8fb9\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Despite their importance, understanding the microscopic sources of TLS and how to mitigate them has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput, correlated approach to trace the microstructural origins of strongly-coupled TLS in Josephson circuits. We assembled a massive dataset of TLS across 6,000 Al/AlOx/Al JJs and more than 600 atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy images. We statistically link fabrication, microstructure, and TLS occurrence, revealing a strong correlation between Al electrode thickness, Al grain size, and TLS density. Correspondingly, we find a two-thirds reduction in TLS prompted by a change in electrode fabrication parameters. These results demonstrate a robust, data-driven methodology to understand and control defects in quantum circuits and pave the way for significantly reducing TLS density.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf96000\u4e2a\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u68ee\u7ed3\u548c600\u5f20TEM\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u94dd\u7535\u6781\u539a\u5ea6\u548c\u6676\u7c92\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0eTLS\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u6539\u53d8\u5236\u5907\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u5c06TLS\u51cf\u5c11\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u68ee\u7ed3\u4e2d\u7684\u6750\u6599\u7f3a\u9677\uff08TLS\uff09\u4e0e\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u662f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5fae\u89c2\u6765\u6e90\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u7f13\u89e3\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u5173\u8054\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4e866000\u4e2aAl/AlOx/Al\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u68ee\u7ed3\u7684TLS\u6570\u636e\u548c600\u591a\u5f20\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u5236\u5907\u5de5\u827a\u3001\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0eTLS\u53d1\u751f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u94dd\u7535\u6781\u539a\u5ea6\u3001\u94dd\u6676\u7c92\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0eTLS\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u7535\u6781\u5236\u5907\u53c2\u6570\uff0cTLS\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eTLS\u5bc6\u5ea6\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

However, traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers, requiring researchers to possess dual backgrounds in statistics and computer science, while manually selecting algorithms, handling data quality issues, and interpreting complex results. To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report.

We propose TopoGBM, a learning framework designed to capture heterogeneity-preserved, scanner-robust representations from multi-parametric 3D MRI. Central to our approach is a 3D convolutional autoencoder regularized by a topological regularization that preserves the complex, non-Euclidean invariants of the tumor's manifold within a compressed latent space. By enforcing these topological priors, TopoGBM explicitly models the high-variance structural signatures characteristic of aggressive GBM. Evaluated across heterogeneous cohorts (UPENN, UCSF, RHUH) and external validation on TCGA, TopoGBM achieves better performance (C-index 0.67 test, 0.58 validation), outperforming baselines that degrade under domain shift. Mechanistic interpretability analysis reveals that reconstruction residuals are highly localized to pathologically heterogeneous zones, with tumor-restricted and healthy tissue error significantly low (Test: 0.03, Validation: 0.09). Furthermore, occlusion-based attribution localizes approximately 50% of the prognostic signal to the tumor and the diverse peritumoral microenvironment advocating clinical reliability of the unsupervised learning method. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating topological priors enables the learning of morphology-faithful embeddings that capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "TopoGBM is a novel deep learning framework that uses topological regularization on 3D MRI to capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining robustness across different medical scanners, significantly improving glioblastoma prognosis accuracy.", "motivation": "Conventional deep learning models fail to capture glioblastoma's extreme structural heterogeneity and suffer from poor generalizability across different MRI scanners due to inconsistent acquisition protocols, leading to scanner-specific artifacts and degraded cross-site prognosis performance.", "method": "A 3D convolutional autoencoder architecture regularized by topological priors to preserve non-Euclidean tumor manifold invariants in a compressed latent space, explicitly modeling high-variance structural signatures of aggressive GBM from multi-parametric MRI.", "result": "Achieved superior performance (C-index 0.67 test, 0.58 validation) across heterogeneous cohorts (UPENN, UCSF, RHUH, TCGA), with interpretability analysis showing reconstruction residuals localized to heterogeneous tumor zones and ~50% of prognostic signal from tumor and peritumoral microenvironment.", "conclusion": "Incorporating topological priors enables learning of morphology-faithful embeddings that effectively capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness, demonstrating clinical reliability for unsupervised prognosis prediction."}}

Clinical decision support systems incorporating artificial intelligence (AI-CDSS) can assist medical professionals in diagnosing type 2 diabetes with high accuracy. This study aimed to assess an AI-CDSS specifically developed for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by employing a hybrid approach that integrates expert-driven insights with machine learning techniques. The AI-CDSS was developed (training dataset: n = 650) and tested (test dataset: n = 648) using a dataset of 1298 patients with and without type 2 diabetes. To generate predictions, the algorithm utilized key features such as body mass index, plasma fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1C. Furthermore, a clinical pilot study involving 105 patients was conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the system in comparison to non-endocrinology specialists. The AI-CDSS showed a high degree of accuracy, with 99.8% accuracy in predicting diabetes, 99.3% in predicting prediabetes, 99.2% in identifying at-risk individuals, and 98.8% in predicting no diabetes. The test dataset revealed a 98.8% agreement between endocrinology specialists and the AI-CDSS. Type 2 diabetes was identified in 45% of 105 individuals in the pilot study. Compared with diabetes specialists, the AI-CDSS scored a 98.5% concordance rate, greatly exceeding that of nonendocrinology specialists, who had an 85% agreement rate.

As researchers create more complex memory architectures, it becomes increasingly difficult to analyze their capabilities and guide future memory designs. Most long-term memory benchmarks focus on simple fact retention, multi-hop recall, and time-based changes. While undoubtedly important, these capabilities can often be achieved with simple retrieval-augmented LLMs and do not test complex memory hierarchies. To bridge this gap, we propose StructMemEval - a benchmark that tests the agent's ability to organize its long-term memory, not just factual recall. We gather a suite of tasks that humans solve by organizing their knowledge in a specific structure: transaction ledgers, to-do lists, trees and others.

Recent work has shown that surprisingly simple measurement protocols--comprising only single-qubit measurements--suffice to certify arbitrary $n$-qubit states [Huang, Preskill, Soleimanifar '25; Gupta, He, O'Donnell '25]. However, these certification protocols are not robust: rather than allowing constant $\u03b5_1$, they can only positively certify states within $\u03b5_1=O(1/n)$ trace distance of the target. In many experimental settings, the appropriate error tolerance is constant as the system size grows, so this lack of robustness renders existing tests inapplicable at scale, no matter how many times the test is repeated.\n  Here we present robust certification protocols based on few-qubit measurements that apply to all but a $O(2^{-n})$-fraction of pure target states. Our first protocol achieves constant robustness, i.e. $\u03b5_1=\u0398(1)$, using a single $O(\\log n)$-qubit measurement along with single-qubit measurements in the $Z$ or $X$ basis on the other qubits. As a corollary of its robustness, this protocol also achieves constant (in $n$) copy complexity, which is optimal. Our second protocol uses exclusively single-qubit measurements and is nearly robust: $\u03b5_1=\u03a9(1/\\log n)$.

We separate the hypothesis into two claims: linear representation (features are linearly embedded in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). We then ask: How many neurons $d$ suffice to both linearly represent and linearly access $m$ features? Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.\n  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = \u03a9_\u03b5(\\frac{k^2}{\\log k}\\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_\u03b5(k^2\\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the \"superposition hypothesis\" (Elhage et al., 2022).\n  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Tur\u00e1n's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs). We also show how our results do and do not constrain the geometry of feature representations and extend our results to allow decoders with an activation function and bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved.

It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage.

In addition, the large 64-element group size enables matrix multiplications to be executed in a highly fixed-point manner, significantly reducing hardware area and power consumption. To evaluate the proposed format, we conducted inference experiments on several language models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek-V3.1 and LongCat. Results show that HiF4 achieves higher average accuracy than the state-of-the-art NVFP4 format across multiple models and diverse downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHiFloat4 (HiF4)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5757\u6d6e\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2aHiF4\u5355\u5143\u5305\u542b64\u4e2a4\u4f4d\u5143\u7d20\u548c32\u4f4d\u5171\u4eab\u7f29\u653e\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u4e2a\u503c\u53604.5\u4f4d\u3002\u8be5\u683c\u5f0f\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u7ea7\u7f29\u653e\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u5f0f\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u529f\u8017\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6bd4NVFP4\u683c\u5f0f\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u548c\u9762\u79ef\u3002\u5757\u6d6e\u70b9\u683c\u5f0f\u80fd\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5982NVFP4\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002HiF4\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5206\u7ec4\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1HiF4\u683c\u5f0f\uff1a64\u4e2a4\u4f4d\u5143\u7d20\u5171\u4eab32\u4f4d\u7f29\u653e\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f62\u62104.5\u4f4d/\u503c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u7ea7\u7f29\u653e\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u6355\u83b7\u7ec4\u95f4\u548c\u7ec4\u5185\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\uff1b\u5229\u752864\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5927\u5206\u7ec4\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u5316\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u3002\u5728LLaMA\u3001Qwen\u3001Mistral\u3001DeepSeek-V3.1\u548cLongCat\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHiF4\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684NVFP4\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "HiF4\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5757\u6d6e\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6781\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted. We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy. Adaptive weighting and curriculum focused learning further boost performance across signal combinations. MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access.

In this context, we analyze the design and performance of distributed Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) architectures for learning functions of quantum states directly from data, restricting measurements to easily implementable projective measurements in the computational basis. The aim is to determine which schemes can effectively recover specific properties of input quantum states, including both linear and nonlinear features, while also quantifying the resource requirements in terms of measurements and reservoir dimensionality. We compare standard three-layer QELM with a spatially multiplexed architecture composed of multiple independent three-layer units for linear (quantum) tasks, showing a linear reduction in resource requirements per unit. For nonlinear properties, the study examines the multiple-injection architecture and introduces a novel distributed design that incorporates entanglement between subsystems within a spatially multiplexed framework, evaluating its performance through the reconstruction of complex nonlinear quantities such as polynomial targets, R\u00e9nyi entropy, and entanglement measures.

Modelling and analysis of the performance of satellite entanglement pair distribution is important for the architecture and design of constellations and space systems. Entanglement-based quantum key distribution, in the absence of quantum repeaters, is especially prone to finite key effects due to low coincident count rates compared to trusted node single-path links. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive study of finite-key effects in the context of direct dual downlink quantum key distribution taking into account the characteristics of the overpass geometries. We develop a high-fidelity model of pair distribution from a low Earth orbit satellite that captures orbital dynamics, elevation-dependent loss, background noise, and extraneous detector effects. We integrate this with a rigorous finite-key security framework for the BBM92 protocol to optimise secret key length across different overpass geometries, orbital altitudes, and optical ground station (OGS) separations.

This assumption -- that useful memories are similar memories -- fails to capture a fundamental property of biological memory: association through temporal co-occurrence. We propose Predictive Associative Memory (PAM), an architecture in which a JEPA-style predictor, trained on temporal co-occurrence within a continuous experience stream, learns to navigate the associative structure of an embedding space. We introduce an Inward JEPA that operates over stored experience (predicting associatively reachable past states) as the complement to the standard Outward JEPA that operates over incoming sensory data (predicting future states). We evaluate PAM as an associative recall system -- testing faithfulness of recall for experienced associations -- rather than as a retrieval system evaluated on generalisation to unseen associations. On a synthetic benchmark, the predictor's top retrieval is a true temporal associate 97% of the time (Association Precision@1 = 0.970); it achieves cross-boundary Recall@20 = 0.421 where cosine similarity scores zero; and it separates experienced-together from never-experienced-together states with a discrimination AUC of 0.916 (cosine: 0.789). Even restricted to cross-room pairs where embedding similarity is uninformative, the predictor achieves AUC = 0.849 (cosine: 0.503, chance). A temporal shuffle control confirms the signal is genuine temporal co-occurrence structure, not embedding geometry: shuffling collapses cross-boundary recall by 90%, replicated across training seeds.

A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box\" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS.

In medicine, such interventions arise in physiological regulation (e.g., cardiovascular system under fluid administration) and pharmacokinetics, among others. Propofol administration is an anesthetic intervention, where the challenge is to estimate the optimal dose required to achieve a target brain concentration for anesthesia, given patient characteristics, while avoiding under- or over-dosing. The pharmacokinetic state is characterized by drug concentrations across tissues, and its dynamics are governed by prior states, patient covariates, drug clearance, and drug administration. While data-driven models can capture complex dynamics, they often fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Mechanistic models on the other hand are typically robust, but might be oversimplified. We propose a hybrid mechanistic-data-driven approach to estimate time-dependent intervention outcomes. Our approach decomposes the dynamical system's transition operator into parametric and nonparametric components, further distinguishing between intervention-related and unrelated dynamics. This structure leverages mechanistic anchors while learning residual patterns from data. For scenarios where mechanistic parameters are unknown, we introduce a two-stage procedure: first, pre-training an encoder on simulated data, and subsequently learning corrections from observed data. Two regimes with incomplete mechanistic knowledge are considered: periodic pendulum and Propofol bolus injections. Results demonstrate that our hybrid approach outperforms purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches, particularly OOD.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing.

Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to \"context poisoning,\" where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency.

These methods enable low-latency primitives for readout calibration, spectroscopy, pulse-amplitude calibration, coherence estimation, and benchmarking. We deploy this toolset to estimate $T_1$ in 10 ms, optimize readout parameters in 100 ms, optimize pulse amplitudes in 1 ms, and perform Clifford randomized gate benchmarking in 107 ms on a flux-tunable superconducting transmon qubit. Running a closed-loop on-FPGA recalibration protocol continuously for 6 hours enables more than 74,000 consecutive recalibrations and yields gate errors that consistently retain better performance than the baseline initial calibration. Correlation analysis shows that recalibration suppresses coupling of gate error to control-parameter drift while preserving a coherence-linked performance.

Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u51c6\u5065\u5eb7\u6307\u6570(BHI)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u80fd\u529b\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u3001\u6297\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u6570\u901a\u80c0\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62a5\u544a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5371\u673a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u56e0\u5206\u6570\u901a\u80c0\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62a5\u544a\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u793e\u533a\u5bf9\u54ea\u4e9b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4ecd\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684Benchmark Health Index (BHI)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u80fd\u529b\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\uff08\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u80fd\uff09\u3001\u6297\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u5269\u4f59\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\uff08\u91cf\u5316\u751f\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67902025\u5e7491\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684106\u4e2a\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u523b\u753b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u3002", "result": "BHI\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "BHI\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u8bc4\u6d4b\u534f\u8bae\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u9760\u57fa\u51c6\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002"}}

However, despite promising proof-of-principle results, such methods suffer from high sensitivity to noise (including intrinsic sources such as sampling noise), making their utility for realistic industry-relevant problems an open question. To improve the potential applicability of such methods, we introduce a new variant of thresholding for noisy generalized eigenvalue problems that arise in quantum subspace diagonalization that has the potential to better control sensitivity to noise. Our approach leverages eigenvector-preserving transformations (rotations) of the generalized eigenvalue problem prior to thresholding. We study this effect in practical settings by applying this rotation thresholding scheme to an iterative quantum Krylov algorithm for several chemical systems, including the industry-relevant Fe(III)-NTA chelate complex. We develop a particular heuristic to select the rotation angle from noisy data and find for certain systems and noise regimes that the samples required to reach a target error for ground state estimation can be reduced by a factor of up to 100. Furthermore, with oracle access to the optimal transformation, more dramatic improvements are possible and we observe reductions in sample requirements by up to $10^4$, motivating the continued development of methods that can realize these improvements in practice. While we develop our approach in the context of quantum subspace diagonalization, the improved thresholding scheme we develop could be advantageous in any context where one must solve noisy, ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65cb\u8f6c\u9608\u503c\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u91cf\u5b50\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5c06\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u8bef\u5dee\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe100\u500d\uff0c\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe10^4\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u548cKrylov\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4f30\u7b97\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f4e\u80fd\u8c31\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u5e7f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u9608\u503c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9608\u503c\u5904\u7406\u524d\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cf\u5b50Krylov\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5305\u62ec\u5de5\u4e1a\u76f8\u5173\u7684Fe(III)-NTA\u87af\u5408\u7269\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u5316\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5230\u8fbe\u57fa\u6001\u4f30\u7b97\u76ee\u6807\u8bef\u5dee\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe100\u500d\uff1b\u5728\u62e5\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u53d8\u6362\u7684oracle\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe10^4\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u9608\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u4efb\u4f55\u9700\u8981\u6c42\u89e3\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u75c5\u6001\u5e7f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Matrix Product States (MPS) admit more efficient constructions, particularly when accuracy is traded for circuit complexity. Existing approaches to MPS preparation mostly rely on heuristic circuits that are deterministic but quickly saturate in accuracy, or on variational optimization methods that reach high fidelities but scale poorly. This work introduces an end-to-end MPS preparation framework that combines the strengths of both strategies within a single pipeline. Heuristic staircase-like and brick wall disentangler circuits provide warm-start initializations for variational optimization, enabling high-fidelity state preparation for large systems. Target MPSs are either specified as physical quantum states or constructed from classical datasets via amplitude encoding, using step-by-step singular value decompositions or tensor cross interpolation. The framework incorporates entanglement-based qubit reordering, reformulated as a quadratic assignment problem, and low-level optimizations that reduce depths by up to 50% and CNOT counts by 33%. We evaluate the full pipeline on datasets of varying complexity across systems of 19-50 qubits and identify trade-offs between fidelity, gate count, and circuit depth. Optimized brick wall circuits typically achieve the lowest depths, while the optimized staircase-like circuits minimize gate counts.

The extraordinary properties at room temperature of the spin system in diamond have made it one of the most prominent quantum platforms for the development of commercial quantum sensors. In particular, the sensitivity of the electronic spin in NV centers has made diamond-based magnetic sensors of special interest for their potential application in medical, industrial or navigation solutions. However, the use of these sensors for universal vector magnetometry was constrained by the need for previous knowledge on the field being measured to fully exploit their benefits. In this work, we show a method to perform unconditional vector magnetometry without the need of external information on the magnetic field, based only on the spatial arrangement of the diamond and the microwave antenna combination. While previous NV-based vector magnetometry methods require partial knowledge of the magnetic field (e.g. a calibrated bias field), we exploit the possibilities of selecting particular directions of the spins in the diamond with elliptically polarized microwave fields.

Yet, in practice, they generalize robustly. We propose that the effective capacity controlling generalization lies in the geometry of the model's internal representations: while the parameter space is high-dimensional, the activation states lie on a low-dimensional, sparse manifold. To formalize this, we introduce the Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD), a complexity measure derived from the active feature vocabulary of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on the model's layers. Treating the LLM and SAE as frozen oracles, we utilize this framework to attribute the model's generalization capabilities to the sparsity of the dictionary rather than the total parameter count. Empirically, we validate this framework on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2B, demonstrating that our bound provides non-vacuous certificates at realistic sample sizes. Crucially, we uncover a counter-intuitive \"feature sharpness\" scaling law: despite being an order of magnitude larger, Gemma-2B requires significantly fewer calibration samples to identify its active manifold compared to GPT-2, suggesting that larger models learn more compressible, distinct semantic structures. Finally, we show that this framework functions as a reliable safety monitor: out-of-distribution inputs trigger a measurable \"feature explosion\" (a sharp spike in active features), effectively signaling epistemic uncertainty through learned feature violation.

Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning.

We present CADET (Context-Conditioned Ads Decoder-Only Transformer), an end-to-end decoder-only transformer for ads CTR prediction deployed at LinkedIn. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a context-conditioned decoding architecture with multi-tower prediction heads that explicitly model post-scoring signals such as ad position, resolving the chicken-and-egg problem between predicted CTR and ranking; (2) a self-gated attention mechanism that stabilizes training by adaptively regulating information flow at both representation and interaction levels; (3) a timestamp-based variant of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) that captures temporal relationships across timescales from seconds to months; (4) session masking strategies that prevent the model from learning dependencies on unavailable in-session events, addressing train-serve skew; and (5) production engineering techniques including tensor packing, sequence chunking, and custom Flash Attention kernels that enable efficient training and serving at scale. In online A/B testing, CADET achieves a 11.04\\% CTR lift compared to the production LiRank baseline model, a hybrid ensemble of DCNv2 and sequential encoders.

Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%.

In what we connote as spatial quantum sensing the goal is, given an underlying field and a set of quantum sensors interrogating the field in a set of positions, to find an estimator for some property the field. This property can have multiple forms, be it distinguishing the source of a target signal, or evaluating the field (or a derivative thereof) in an arbitrary position. In this work we also link this problem to networks of quantum sensors, and the role and usefulness of entangling these sensors. We find that the estimators that come out as a solution to the problem are such that a non-local entangled strategy provides maximum precision. We start by working under the assumption of polynomial fields, which relates to the interpolation problem, and then generalize for any signal that is modeled via analytical functions, giving rise to any general least-squares estimator. We discuss the effects of the placement of the sensors in the estimation, namely, how to find well defined, construction error-free placements for the sensors. In the case of interpolation we provide concrete examples and proofs in a $m$-dimensional array of sensors, and discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for the more general cases. We provide clear examples of the possible use-cases and statements, and compare a non-local entangled strategy with the best local strategy for an interpolation problem, showing the benefit in terms of precision in a distributed sensing scenario.

Prior claims of dominance of the linear model often stem from benchmarks that lack diverse temporal dynamics and employ biased evaluation protocols. We revisit this debate through TimeSynth, a structured framework that emulates key properties of real world time series,including non-stationarity, periodicity, trends, and phase modulation by creating synthesized signals whose parameters are derived from real-world time series. Evaluating four model families Linear, Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformers, we find a systematic bias in linear models: they collapse to simple oscillation regardless of signal complexity. Nonlinear models avoid this collapse and gain clear advantages as signal complexity increases. Notably, Transformers and CNN based models exhibit slightly greater adaptability to complex modulated signals compared to MLPs. Beyond clean forecasting, the framework highlights robustness differences under distribution and noise shifts and removes biases of prior benchmarks by using independent instances for train, test, and validation for each signal family. Collectively, TimeSynth provides a principled foundation for understanding when different forecasting approaches succeed or fail, moving beyond oversimplified claims of model equivalence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7TimeSynth\u6846\u67b6\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u574d\u7f29\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dTransformer\u548cCNN\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591\u8fd1\u671f\u5173\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5148\u524d\u7ed3\u8bba\u6e90\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1TimeSynth\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u53c2\u6570\u5408\u6210\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3001\u5468\u671f\u6027\u3001\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ebf\u6027\u3001MLP\u3001CNN\u548cTransformer\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f1a\u574d\u7f29\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u632f\u8361\uff1b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u907f\u514d\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u4e14\u968f\u4fe1\u53f7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\uff1bTransformer\u548cCNN\u6bd4MLP\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u8c03\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u66f4\u5177\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "TimeSynth\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f55\u65f6\u6210\u529f\u6216\u5931\u8d25\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8d85\u8d8a\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u8bba\u65ad\u3002"}}

Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "AIR\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u54cd\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u904f\u5236\u548c\u6062\u590d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u62a4\u680f\u89c4\u5219\u9884\u9632\u672a\u6765\u7c7b\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e09\u9879\u6307\u6807\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5747\u8d8590%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u54cd\u5e94\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5404\u81ea\u4e3b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6b63\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u51e0\u4e4e\u53ea\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u9884\u5148\u9632\u6b62\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8b\u6545\u53d1\u751f\u540e\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u904f\u5236\u548c\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAIR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6267\u884c\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a(1)\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8fd1\u671f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u67e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e8b\u6545\uff1b(2)\u6307\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u904f\u5236\u548c\u6062\u590d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b(3)\u5728\u6839\u9664\u9636\u6bb5\u5408\u6210\u62a4\u680f\u89c4\u5219\u4ee5\u963b\u6b62\u672a\u6765\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8b\u6545\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cAIR\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u6839\u9664\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5747\u8d85\u8fc790%\u3002\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793aAIR\u7684\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660eLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u5404\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u63a5\u8fd1\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u7f16\u5199\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u54cd\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e2\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u4e5f\u662f\u5fc5\u4e0d\u53ef\u5c11\u7684\u3002"}}

Our model captures the critical inter-temporal incentives driven by an agent's farsightedness, skill retention, and a leg-up effect where qualification and attainment can be self-reinforcing.

However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute.

In image classification, these models typically recover human-interpretable concepts from an image and use them for classification. Sparse concept recovery methods leverage the latent space of vision-language models to represent image embeddings as a sparse combination of concept embeddings. However, because such methods ignore the hierarchical structure of concepts, they can produce correct predictions with explanations that are inconsistent with the hierarchy. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept Embedding \\& Pursuit (HCEP), a framework that induces a hierarchy of concept embeddings in the latent space and uses hierarchical sparse coding to recover the concepts present in an image. Given a hierarchy of semantic concepts, we construct a corresponding hierarchy of concept embeddings and, assuming the correct concepts for an image form a rooted path in the hierarchy, derive desirable conditions for identifying them in the embedded space. We show that hierarchical sparse coding reliably recovers hierarchical concept embeddings, whereas vanilla sparse coding fails. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HCEP outperforms baselines in concept precision and recall while maintaining competitive classification accuracy.

Assessing these movements is important for helping clinicians prescribe appropriate physical therapy. However, it can be difficult to monitor patients' movements remotely outside the clinic. High-fidelity data from motion capture sensors can be used to classify different movements, but these sensors are costly and impractical for use in free-living environments. Motion Tape (MT), a new fabric-based wearable sensor, addresses these issues by being low cost and portable. Despite these advantages, novelty and variability in sensor stability make the MT dataset small scale and inherent to noise. In this work, we propose the Motion-Tape Augmentation Inference Model (MT-AIM), a deep learning classification pipeline trained on MT data. In order to address the challenges of limited sample size and noise present within the MT dataset, MT-AIM leverages conditional generative models to generate synthetic MT data of a desired movement, as well as predicting joint kinematics as additional features. This combination of synthetic data generation and feature augmentation enables MT-AIM to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in classifying lower back movements, bridging the gap between physiological sensing and movement analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMT-AIM\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5173\u8282\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b0\u578b\u7ec7\u7269\u4f20\u611f\u5668Motion Tape\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5c0f\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0b\u80cc\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u9876\u5c16\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u65e5\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u65b0\u578b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668Motion Tape\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5c0f\u4e14\u566a\u58f0\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0b\u80cc\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ee5\u8f85\u52a9\u8170\u75db\u6cbb\u7597\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMT-AIM\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5408\u6210Motion Tape\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u8282\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4f5c\u4e3a\u989d\u5916\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "MT-AIM\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0b\u80cc\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u9876\u5c16\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u751f\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR).

Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.\n  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines.

In this work, we go beyond the standard aforementioned scenarios by consider not only the classical measurement outcome of a measurement, but also its the post-measurement quantum state. More specifically, instead of considering only the positive-operator valued measure (POVM) operators, we consider their associated L\u00fcders' instrument associated with them. We prove that, when the post-measurement quantum states are available, the task of discriminating two qubit projective measurements is equivalent to discriminating two copies of quantum states associated to each projector pair, extending previous results known for the case where probe states are separable. Then, we proceed by showing that the advantage of considering post-measurement states in measurement discrimination can be large. We formalise this claim by presenting a family of pairs of measurements where the ratio between the discrimination bias of the measurement discrimination task with and without post-measurement states can be arbitrarily large. This shows that, while the post-measurement state was neglected in most of the previous literature, its use can significantly improve the performance of quantum measurement discrimination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u6d4b\u91cf\u540e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff08\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u5224\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5224\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u540e\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u5927\u7684\u5224\u522b\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u5224\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u540e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u540e\u72b6\u6001\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5224\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528 L\u00fcders \u4eea\u5668\u63cf\u8ff0\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5224\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u4e24\u4efd\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5224\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "1) \u5f53\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6d4b\u91cf\u540e\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\uff0c\u5224\u522b\u4e24\u4e2a qubit \u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u5224\u522b\u4e24\u4efd\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff1b2) \u6784\u9020\u51fa\u4e00\u7c7b\u6d4b\u91cf\u5bf9\uff0c\u5176\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u540e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5224\u522b\u504f\u5dee\u6bd4\u53ef\u4efb\u610f\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u540e\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u5224\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u88ab\u4ee5\u5f80\u6587\u732e\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The contribution is twofold. First, an operator defined via the external division of two Bregman proximity operators is introduced to promote sparse solutions while mitigating the estimation bias induced by classical $\\ell_1$-norm regularization. This operator is then embedded into the already established NoLips algorithm, replacing the standard Bregman proximity operator in a plug-and-play manner. Second, the geometric structure of the proposed external-division operator is elucidated through two complementary reformulations, which provide clear interpretations in terms of the primal and dual spaces of the Poisson inverse problem. Numerical tests show that the proposed method exhibits more stable convergence behavior than conventional Kullback-Leibler (KL)-based approaches and achieves significantly superior performance on synthetic data and an image restoration problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "LAVES is a hierarchical multi-agent LLM system that generates instructional videos by decomposing the task into specialized agents (Solution, Illustration, Narration) coordinated by an Orchestrating Agent, achieving over 95% cost reduction and >1M videos/day throughput.", "motivation": "Current end-to-end video generation models perform well for visually-oriented content but fail in scenarios requiring strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation (e.g., instructional/educational media), suffering from low procedural fidelity, high production costs, and limited controllability.", "method": "LAVES decomposes video generation into specialized agents (Solution Agent for problem-solving, Illustration Agent for visualization code, Narration Agent for scripts) coordinated by an Orchestrating Agent with quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms.

A key certification task is verifying that a device has produced a desired output state. In this work, we study this task in the context of photonic platforms, where single photons are propagated through linear optical interferometers to create large, entangled resource states for metrology, communication, quantum advantage demonstrations and for so-called linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). This setting derives its computational power from the indistinguishability of the photons, i.e., their relative overlap. Therefore, standard fidelity witnesses developed for distinguishable particles (including qubits) do not apply directly, because they merely certify the closeness to some fixed target state. We introduce a measure of fidelity suitable for this setting and show several different ways to witness it, based on earlier proposals for measuring genuine multi-photon indistinguishability. We argue that a witness based upon the discrete Fourier transform is an optimal choice.

Given their limited size, these partial state spaces allow the actor to efficiently identify subregions with higher rewards. A heuristic strategy is introduced to switch partial regions thus preventing the actor from wasting time exploring fully explored or low-reward partial regions. By iteratively exploring these partial state spaces, the actor learns to converge towards the high-reward subregions within the entire state space.

Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios.

Recent work by Chakraborty et al, introduced a fair variant under proportionate fairness and obtained a constant-factor approximation by naively selecting the best closest fair input clustering; however, their offline approach requires storing all input clusterings, which is prohibitively expensive for most large-scale applications.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of fair consensus clustering in the streaming model, where input clusterings arrive sequentially and memory is limited. We design the first constant-factor algorithm that processes the stream while storing only a logarithmic number of inputs. En route, we introduce a new generic algorithmic framework that integrates closest fair clustering with cluster fitting, yielding improved approximation guarantees not only in the streaming setting but also when revisited offline.

Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons.

This missing outside-option information makes market-size and preference estimation difficult even in simple multinomial logit (MNL) models, and it is a central obstacle in practice when only transaction data are recorded. Existing approaches often rely on auxiliary market-share, aggregated, or cross-market data. We study a complementary setting in which a black-box auxiliary predictor provides outside-option probabilities, but is potentially biased or miscalibrated because it was trained in a different channel, period, or population, or produced by an external machine-learning system. We develop calibration methods that turn such imperfect predictions into statistically valid no-purchase estimates using purchase-only data from the focal environment. First, under affine miscalibration in logit space, we show that a simple regression identifies outside-option utility parameters and yields consistent recovery of no-purchase probabilities without collecting new labels for no-purchase events. Second, under a weaker nearly monotone condition, we propose a rank-based calibration method and derive finite-sample error bounds that cleanly separate auxiliary-predictor quality from first-stage utility-learning error over observed in-set choices. Our analysis also translates estimation error into downstream decision quality for assortment optimization, quantifying how calibration accuracy affects revenue performance. The bounds provide explicit dependence on predictor alignment and utility-learning error, clarifying when each source dominates.

However, objectively measuring the theoretical performance ceilings of diverse architectures across heterogeneous platforms remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we propose a systematic framework based on the Roofline model that unifies architectural primitives and hardware constraints through the lens of operational intensity (OI). By defining an inference-potential region, we introduce the Relative Inference Potential as a novel metric to compare efficiency differences between Large Language Models (LLMs) on the same hardware substrate. Extensive empirical analysis across diverse compute tiers reveals that variations in performance and OI are significantly influenced by sequence length. We further identify a critical regression in OI as model depth increases. Additionally, our findings highlight an efficiency trap induced by hardware heterogeneity and demonstrate how structural refinements, such as Multi-head Latent Attention (M LA), can effectively unlock latent inference potential across various hardware substrates. These insights provide actionable directions for hardware-software co-design to align neural structures with physical constraints in on-device intelligence.

Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. \"woman\") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u539f\u578bTransformer(ProtoT)\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5411\u91cf\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8def\u5f84", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u4efb\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u6b3a\u9a97\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff08\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\uff09\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u5411\u91cf\uff08parameter vectors\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u539f\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u901a\u4fe1\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u547d\u540d\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982\"\u5973\u4eba\"\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\u901a\u9053", "result": "1) \u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff08vs \u6807\u51c6Transformer\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\uff09 2) \u5728GLUE\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63a5\u8fd1SOTA\u6027\u80fd 3) \u539f\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u6355\u83b7\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84 4) \u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "ProtoT\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u9700\u6c42"}}

A primary challenge lies in the trade-off between reward fidelity and density: outcome reward offers high fidelity but suffers from signal sparsity, while process reward provides dense supervision but remains prone to bias and reward hacking. To resolve this conflict, we propose the Adaptive Milestone Reward (ADMIRE) mechanism. ADMIRE constructs a verifiable, adaptive reward system by anchoring trajectory to milestones, which are dynamically distilled from successful explorations.

Under review", "summary": "Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTalk2DM\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\u589e\u5f3a\u8f66\u8def\u4e91\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u56fe\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728Qwen3\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523093%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e14\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec52-5\u79d2", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f66\u8def\u4e91\u534f\u540c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u56fe(DM)\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4eba\u56fe\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e9f\u9700\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "method": "1) \u5f00\u53d1VRCsim\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u8f66\u8def\u4e91\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e 2) \u6784\u5efaVRC-QA\u7a7a\u95f4\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u96c6 3) \u8bbe\u8ba1Talk2DM\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u94fe\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a(CoP)\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u4e0eLLM\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6", "result": "Talk2DM\u5728VRC-QA\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b093%+\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f42-5\u79d2\uff1b\u652f\u6301Qwen3:8B/Gemma3:27B/GPT-oss\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u7f1d\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u4f46\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u6548\u7387"}}

We argue that fitting a single model to capture both effects creates an optimization conflict: the high-variance updates needed for cross-dimension modeling can corrupt the gradients that support autoregression, resulting in brittle training and degraded long-horizon accuracy. To address this, we propose ALTTS, a dual-path framework that explicitly decouples autoregression and cross-relation (CR) modeling. In ALTTS, the AR path is instantiated with a linear predictor, while the CR path uses a Transformer equipped with Cross-Relation Self-Attention (CRSA); the two branches are coordinated via alternating optimization to isolate gradient noise and reduce cross-block interference.

One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary \"all-or-nothing\" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61\uff08SA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u7ec6\u8282\u7a0b\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u56de\u907f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e8c\u503c\u56de\u907f\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u573a\u666f\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u5e38\u5e38\u4e22\u5f03\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316SA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5c06\u56de\u590d\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u7528\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u4f46\u66f4\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u66ff\u6362\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u5728FactScore\u548cLongFact-Objects\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u516d\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7SA\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u58f0\u660e\u5220\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u98ce\u9669-\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\uff08AURC\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe27.73%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u59cb\u542b\u4e49\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u503c\u56de\u907f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This dependency incurs significant data-collection costs, risks embedding human cognitive biases, and confines the reinforcement learning stage to objectively assessable domains like mathematics and coding, leaving a wide range of unverifiable tasks beyond its scope. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NRT (Native Reasoning Training), a novel framework that cultivates complex reasoning by having the model generate its own reasoning traces using only standard question-answer pairs, thereby obviating the need for expert-written demonstrations. NRT reframes the training problem by treating the reasoning process as a latent variable. It employs a unified training objective that models reasoning as an optimization problem, intrinsically rewarding paths that increase the model's likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. This unified perspective allows us to analyze intrinsic failure modes of prior methods, such as policy collapse, and systematically design more robust reward aggregation functions, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop where the model learns to think in ways that resolve its own uncertainty. Empirical evaluation on Llama and Mistral model families demonstrates that NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance among verifier-free methods, significantly outperforming standard SFT baselines and prior verifier-free RL methods.

However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

In this work, we study the implicit bias of mini-batch stochastic steepest descent in multi-class classification, characterizing how batch size, momentum, and variance reduction shape the limiting max-margin behavior and convergence rates under general entry-wise and Schatten-$p$ norms. We show that without momentum, convergence only occurs with large batches, yielding a batch-dependent margin gap but the full-batch convergence rate. In contrast, momentum enables small-batch convergence through a batch-momentum trade-off, though it slows convergence. This approach provides fully explicit, dimension-free rates that improve upon prior results. Moreover, we prove that variance reduction can recover the exact full-batch implicit bias for any batch size, albeit at a slower convergence rate. Finally, we further investigate the batch-size-one steepest descent without momentum, and reveal its convergence to a fundamentally different bias via a concrete data example, which reveals a key limitation of purely stochastic updates.

However, despite their rapid proliferation, the field lacks a unified understanding of existing methodologies and a standardized evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we map the benchmark design space along two axes: (i) from the model perspective, we organize BFMs under a self-supervised learning (SSL) taxonomy; and (ii) from the dataset perspective, we summarize common downstream tasks and curate representative public datasets across clinical and human-centric neurotechnology applications. Building on this consolidation, we introduce Brain4FMs, an open evaluation platform with plug-and-play interfaces that integrates 15 representative BFMs and 18 public datasets.

While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process.

In this paper, we find that gradient compression induces sharper loss landscapes in federated learning, particularly under non-IID data distributions, which suggests hindered generalization capability. The recently emerging Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) effectively searches for a flat minima by incorporating a gradient ascent step (i.e., perturbing the model with gradients) before the celebrated stochastic gradient descent. Nonetheless, the direct application of SAM in FL suffers from inaccurate estimation of the global perturbation due to data heterogeneity. Existing approaches propose to utilize the model update from the previous communication round as a rough estimate.

While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDTAPP-IICR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u673a\u7fa4\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u98de\u884c\u524d\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u65b0\u578b4D\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u5668SFIPP-ST\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fed\u4ee3\u51b2\u7a81\u6d88\u89e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5343\u67b6\u7ea7\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u7981\u98de\u533a\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u673a\u7fa4\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u98de\u884c\u524d\u89c4\u5212\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u65f6\u7a7a\u7981\u98de\u533a(NFZs)\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4ea4\u4ed8\u671f\u9650\u7b49\u3002\u867d\u7136\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212(MAPF)\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u65e0\u4eba\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406(UTM)\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDTAPP-IICR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7d27\u6025\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u89e3\uff1b2)\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u578b4D\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\u5668SFIPP-ST\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7fa4\u5f80\u8fd4\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u3001\u5f3a\u5236\u65f6\u7a7a\u7981\u98de\u533a\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u51b2\u7a81\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b3)\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u51b2\u7a81\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90bb\u57df\u641c\u7d22\u89e3\u51b3\u5269\u4f59\u51b2\u7a81\uff1b4)\u4f7f\u7528\u4fdd\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u52a0\u901f\u4e09\u7ef4\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u542b\u65f6\u7a7a\u7981\u98de\u533a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDTAPP-IICR\u5bf91000\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1100%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u8fbe50%\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u51cf\uff0c\u5728UTM\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6279\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u7ea7\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DTAPP-IICR\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u52a8\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u7a7a\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u98de\u884c\u524d\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u673a\u7fa4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u6d88\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics.

We argue this scalar framing is fundamentally limited: when training requires multiple distinct capabilities, a monolithic scorer cannot maximize useful signals for all of them simultaneously. Quality is better understood as multidimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a capability the model must acquire. We introduce SkillRater, a framework that decomposes data filtering into specialized raters - one per capability, each trained via meta-learning on a disjoint validation objective - and composes their scores through a progressive selection rule: at each training stage, a sample is retained if any rater ranks it above a threshold that tightens over time, preserving diversity early while concentrating on high-value samples late. We validate this approach on vision language models, decomposing quality into three capability dimensions: visual understanding, OCR, and STEM reasoning. At 2B parameters, SkillRater improves over unfiltered baselines by 5.63% on visual understanding, 2.00% on OCR, and 3.53% on STEM on held out benchmarks.

However, the common belief that increasing training resources such as model size, dataset size, and training compute improves both pretraining loss and downstream task performance has not been systematically validated in the chemical domain. In this work, we evaluate this assumption by pretraining CLMs while scaling training resources and measuring transfer performance across diverse molecular property prediction (MPP) tasks. We find that while pretraining loss consistently decreases with increased training resources, downstream task performance shows limited improvement. Moreover, alternative metrics based on the Hessian or loss landscape also fail to estimate downstream performance in CLMs. We further identify conditions under which downstream performance saturates or degrades despite continued improvements in pretraining metrics, and analyze the underlying task dependent failure modes through parameter space visualizations. These results expose a gap between pretraining based evaluation and downstream performance, and emphasize the need for model selection and evaluation strategies that explicitly account for downstream task characteristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\"\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u603b\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5316\u5b66\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\"\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u529b\uff09\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CLMs\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5206\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u7528Hessian\u548c\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u968f\u8d44\u6e90\u589e\u52a0\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff1bHessian\u7b49\u66ff\u4ee3\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u9971\u548c\u6216\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u663e\u5f0f\u8003\u8651\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The quality of feature rankings is typically assessed with the insertion and deletion metrics. Empirically, we observe that co-optimizing these two metrics is closely related to a joint optimization that selects a subset of features to maximize the local predicted value while minimizing it for the complement. However, we theoretically show that probabilistic values are generally unreliable for solving this joint optimization. Therefore, we explore deriving feature rankings by directly optimizing the joint objective. As the backbone, we propose TreeGrad, which computes the gradients of the multilinear extension of the joint objective in $O(L)$ time for decision trees with $L$ leaves; these gradients include weighted Banzhaf values. Building upon TreeGrad, we introduce TreeGrad-Ranker, which aggregates the gradients while optimizing the joint objective to produce feature rankings, and TreeGrad-Shap, a numerically stable algorithm for computing Beta Shapley values with integral parameters. In particular, the feature scores computed by TreeGrad-Ranker satisfy all the axioms uniquely characterizing probabilistic values, except for linearity, which itself leads to the established unreliability. Empirically, we demonstrate that the numerical error of Linear TreeShap can be up to $10^{15}$ times larger than that of TreeGrad-Shap when computing the Shapley value. As a by-product, we also develop TreeProb, which generalizes Linear TreeShap to support all probabilistic values. In our experiments, TreeGrad-Ranker performs significantly better on both insertion and deletion metrics.

In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the \"wand\" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%.

However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain.

Recently, the focus of GPL has shifted from in-domain to cross-domain scenarios, which is closer to the real world applications, where the pre-training source and downstream target often differ substantially in data distribution. However, why GPLs remain effective under such domain shifts is still unexplored. Empirically, we observe that representative GPL methods are competitive with two simple baselines in cross-domain settings: full fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP), motivating us to explore a deeper understanding of the prompting mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that jointly leveraging these two complementary branches yields a smaller estimation error than using either branch alone, formally proving that cross-domain GPL benefits from the integration between pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method that explicitly instantiates the two extremes: (1) a frozen branch that retains pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation.

Existing defenses, such as Differential Privacy (DP), typically employ indiscriminate noise injection across all parameters, which severely degrades model utility and convergence stability. To address those limitation, we proposes Targeted Interpretable Perturbation (TIP), a novel defense framework that integrates model interpretability with frequency domain analysis. Unlike conventional methods that treat parameters uniformly, TIP introduces a dual-targeting strategy. First, leveraging Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to quantify channel sensitivity, we dynamically identify critical convolution channels that encode primary semantic features. Second, we transform these selected kernels into the frequency domain via the Discrete Fourier Transform and selectively inject calibrated perturbations into the high-frequency spectrum. By selectively perturbing high-frequency components, TIP effectively destroys the fine-grained details necessary for image reconstruction while preserving the low-frequency information crucial for model accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TIP renders reconstructed images visually unrecognizable against state-of-the-art GIAs, while maintaining global model accuracy comparable to non-private baselines, significantly outperforming existing DP-based defenses in the privacy-utility trade-off and interpretability.

It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.\n  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While effective on in-distribution (ID) data, GNNs often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes with unseen textual or structural patterns in real-world settings, leading to overconfident and erroneous predictions in the absence of reliable OOD detection. Early approaches address this issue from a topology-driven perspective, leveraging neighboring structures to mitigate node-level detection bias. However, these methods typically encode node texts as shallow vector features, failing to fully exploit rich semantic information. In contrast, recent LLM-based approaches generate pseudo OOD priors by leveraging textual knowledge, but they suffer from several limitations: (1) a reliability-informativeness imbalance in the synthesized OOD priors, as the generated OOD exposures either deviate from the true OOD semantics, or introduce non-negligible ID noise, all of which offers limited improvement to detection performance; (2) reliance on specialized architectures, which prevents incorporation of the extensive effective topology-level insights that have been empirically validated in prior work. To this end, we propose LG-Plug, an LLM-Guided Plug-and-play strategy for TAG OOD detection tasks. LG-Plug aligns topology and text representations to produce fine-grained node embeddings, then generates consensus-driven OOD exposure via clustered iterative LLM prompting. Moreover, it leverages lightweight in-cluster codebook and heuristic sampling reduce time cost of LLM querying.

Existing OBO algorithms are mainly based on hypergradient descent, which requires access to a Hessian-vector product (HVP) oracle and potentially incurs high computational costs. By reformulating the original OBO problem as a single-level online problem with inequality constraints and constructing a sequence of Lagrangian function, we eliminate the need for HVPs arising from implicit differentiation.

Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60+T5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u5e8f\u5217\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f9d\u8d56", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u538b\u7f29\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a20\u5bc6\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ee4\u724c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5b8c\u6574\u6027", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3T5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u4ee4\u724c\u5e8f\u5217\u800c\u975e\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u6cd5\u6216\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u65e0\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u7528\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u53d1\u5c55"}}

Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u7591\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u867d\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u793e\u4ea4\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u975e\u6e90\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u68c0\u9a8c\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u2014\u2014\u5373\u5bf9\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u63a2\u9488\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001-\u884c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4e14\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u975e\u6e90\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u6216\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

However, early looped Transformers often underperform non-recursive baselines of equal compute.

In this paper, we propose SpiralFormer, a looped Transformer that executes recurrence under a multi-resolution recursion schedule. We provide probing evidence that multi-resolution recursion enables the model to learn hierarchical dependencies by inducing iteration-wise functional specialization across different scales.

That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.\n  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.\n  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's \"bitter lesson\" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier.

Models do not consistently leverage relevant rows, and noisy context can degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose TabSieve, a select-then-predict framework that makes evidence usage explicit and auditable. Given a table and a query row, TabSieve first selects a small set of informative rows as evidence and then predicts the missing target conditioned on the selected evidence. To enable this capability, we construct TabSieve-SFT-40K by synthesizing high-quality reasoning trajectories from 331 real tables using a strong teacher model with strict filtering. Furthermore, we introduce TAB-GRPO, a reinforcement learning recipe that jointly optimizes evidence selection and prediction correctness with separate rewards, and stabilizes mixed regression and classification training via dynamic task-advantage balancing. Experiments on a held-out benchmark of 75 classification and 52 regression tables show that TabSieve consistently improves performance across shot budgets, with average gains of 2.92% on classification and 4.45% on regression over the second-best baseline.

In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations.

To address these challenges, we construct CuKe, an augmented supervised fine-tuning dataset optimized for high-performance CUDA kernels. On top of it, we propose a bi-phase curated reinforcement learning (BiC-RL) framework consisting of a CUDA kernel infilling stage and an end-to-end CUDA kernel generation stage. Leveraging this training framework, we introduce DICE, a series of diffusion large language models designed for CUDA kernel generation, spanning three parameter scales, 1.7B, 4B, and 8B. Extensive experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that DICE significantly outperforms both autoregressive and diffusion LLMs of comparable scale, establishing a new state-of-the-art for CUDA kernel generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDICE\u7cfb\u5217\u6269\u6563\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8eCUDA\u5185\u6838\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6CuKe\u548c\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6BiC-RL\uff0c\u5728KernelBench\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u521b\u4e0b\u65b0SOTA", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u5907\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u5411\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684CUDA\u5185\u6838\u751f\u6210\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e25\u91cd\u532e\u4e4f\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u6311\u6218", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u589e\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u96c6CuKe\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6BiC-RL\uff08CUDA\u5185\u6838\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5+\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\uff09", "result": "1.7B/4B/8B\u53c2\u6570\u7684DICE\u6a21\u578b\u5728KernelBench\u4e0a\u5168\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230CUDA\u5185\u6838\u751f\u6210\u65b0SOTA", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027"}}

Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers.

We explore an alternative view inspired by neuromodulation: adaptation as a change in \\emph{mode} -- selecting and rescaling existing computations -- rather than rewriting the underlying weights. We propose \\methodname{}, a simple activation-space PEFT technique that freezes base weights and learns per-neuron \\emph{thresholds} and \\emph{gains}. During training, a smooth gate decides whether a neuron's activation participates; at inference the gate can be hardened to yield explicit conditional computation and neuron-level attributions.\n  As a proof of concept, we study ``mode specialization'' on MNIST (0$^\\circ$) versus rotated MNIST (45$^\\circ$). We pretrain a small MLP on a 50/50 mixture (foundation), freeze its weights, and then specialize to the rotated mode using \\methodname{}. Across seeds, \\methodname{} improves rotated accuracy over the frozen baseline while using only a few hundred trainable parameters per layer, and exhibits partial activation sparsity (a minority of units strongly active).

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations.

We introduce UFO (U-Former ODE), a novel architecture that seamlessly integrates the parallelizable, multiscale feature extraction of U-Nets, the powerful global modelling of Transformers, and the continuous-time dynamics of Neural CDEs. By constructing a fully causal, parallelizable model, UFO achieves a global receptive field while retaining strong sensitivity to local temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks -- covering both regularly and irregularly sampled time series -- demonstrate that UFO consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art neural baselines in predictive accuracy.

We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model.

However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious.

Choosing suitable thresholds relies on the specific distribution of the underlying model scores but also on the specific business decisions of each client using that model. However, retraining models inevitably shifts score distributions, invalidating existing thresholds. In multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments, where decision boundaries reside in client-managed infrastructure, this creates a severe bottleneck: recalibration requires coordinating threshold updates across hundreds of clients, consuming excessive human hours and leading to model stagnation. We introduce MUSE, a model serving framework that enables seamless model updates by decoupling model scores from client decision boundaries. Designed for multi-tenancy, MUSE optimizes infrastructure re-use by sharing models via dynamic intent-based routing, combined with a two-level score transformation that maps model outputs to a stable, reference distribution. Deployed at scale by Feedzai, MUSE processes over a thousand events per second, and over 55 billion events in the last 12 months, across several dozens of tenants, while maintaining high-availability and low-latency guarantees.

High temperatures encourage diverse but noisy outputs, while low temperatures produce focused outputs but may cause premature convergence.

We propose Temperature Adaptive Meta Policy Optimization (TAMPO), a new framework that recasts temperature control as a learnable meta-policy. TAMPO operates through a hierarchical two-loop process. In the inner loop, the LLM policy is updated (e.g., using GRPO) with trajectories sampled at the temperature selected by the meta-policy. In the outer loop, meta-policy updates the distribution over candidate temperatures by rewarding those that maximize the likelihood of high-advantage trajectories. This trajectory-guided, reward-driven mechanism enables online adaptation without additional rollouts, directly aligning exploration with policy improvement. On five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, TAMPO outperforms baselines using fixed or heuristic temperatures, establishing temperature as an effective learnable meta-policy for adaptive exploration in LLM reinforcement learning.

In the light of this issue, many methods have been proposed to enhance the fairness guarantees of classifiers. Most of the existing interventions assume access to group information for all instances, a requirement rarely met in practice. Fairness without access to demographic information has often been approached through robust optimization techniques,which target worst-case outcomes over a set of plausible distributions known as the uncertainty set. However, their effectiveness is strongly influenced by the chosen uncertainty set. In fact, existing approaches often overemphasize outliers or overly pessimistic scenarios, compromising both overall performance and fairness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a minimax-fair method that adjusts the spectrum of a simple Fourier feature mapping and constrains the extent to which the worst-case distribution can deviate from the empirical distribution. We perform extensive experiments on the American Community Survey datasets involving 20 states. The safeness of SPECTRE comes as it provides the highest average values on fairness guarantees together with the smallest interquartile range in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches, even compared to those with access to demographic group information. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis that derives computable bounds on the worst-case error for both individual groups and the overall population, as well as characterizes the worst-case distributions responsible for these extremal performances", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes SPECTRE, a minimax-fair classification method that ensures fairness without demographic information by adjusting Fourier feature spectrum and constraining distributional deviation.

Submitted to TMLR", "summary": "Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess safety risk through breadth-oriented evaluation across diverse tasks. However, real-world deployment exposes a different class of risk: operational failures arising from repeated inference on identical or near-identical prompts rather than broad task generalization. In high-stakes settings, response consistency and safety under sustained use are critical. We introduce Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST), a depth-oriented evaluation framework inspired by reliability engineering. APST repeatedly samples identical prompts under controlled operational conditions (e.g., decoding temperature) to surface latent failure modes including hallucinations, refusal inconsistency, and unsafe completions. Rather than treating failures as isolated events, APST models them as stochastic outcomes of independent inference events. We formalize safety failures using Bernoulli and binomial models to estimate per-inference failure probabilities, enabling quantitative comparison of reliability across models and decoding configurations. Applying APST to multiple instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on AIR-BENCH-derived safety prompts, we find that models with similar benchmark-aligned scores can exhibit substantially different empirical failure rates under repeated sampling, particularly as temperature increases. These results demonstrate that shallow, single-sample evaluation can obscure meaningful reliability differences under sustained use.

We propose the Incremental Signature Contribution (ISC) method, which decomposes truncated path signatures into a temporally ordered sequence of elements in the tensor-algebra space, corresponding to incremental contributions induced by last path increments. This reconstruction preserves the algebraic structure and expressivity of signatures, while making their internal temporal evolution explicit, enabling processing signature-based representations via sequential modeling approaches. In contrast to full signatures, ISC is inherently sensitive to instantaneous trajectory updates, which is critical for sensitive and stability-requiring control dynamics. Building on this representation, we introduce ISC-Transformer (ISCT), an offline reinforcement learning model that integrates ISC into a standard Transformer architecture without further architectural modification. We evaluate ISCT on HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Hopper, and Maze2d, including settings with delayed rewards and downgraded datasets.

However, these properties typically require complex observational techniques or expensive particle-resolved numerical simulations, limiting the availability of labeled data. We therefore estimate these hard-to-measure particle properties from routinely available observations (e.g., air pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions). Because routine observations only indirectly reflect particle composition and structure, the mapping from routine observations to particle properties is noisy and input-dependent, yielding a heteroscedastic regression setting. With a limited and costly labeling budget, the central challenge is to select which samples to measure or simulate. While active learning is a natural approach, most acquisition strategies rely on predictive uncertainty. Under heteroscedastic noise, this signal conflates reducible epistemic uncertainty with irreducible aleatoric uncertainty, causing limited budgets to be wasted in noise-dominated regions. To address this challenge, we propose a confidence-aware active learning framework (CAAL) for efficient and robust sample selection in heteroscedastic settings. CAAL consists of two components: a decoupled uncertainty-aware training objective that separately optimises the predictive mean and noise level to stabilise uncertainty estimation, and a confidence-aware acquisition function that dynamically weights epistemic uncertainty using predicted aleatoric uncertainty as a reliability signal. Experiments on particle-resolved numerical simulations and real atmospheric observations show that CAAL consistently outperforms standard AL baselines.

We study this in-context learning phenomenon through the lens of Gaussian Processes (GPs). We build controlled experiments where models observe sequences of multivariate scalar-valued function samples drawn from known GP priors. We evaluate prediction error in relation to the number of demonstrations and compare against two principled references: (i) an empirical GP-regression learner that gives a lower bound on achievable error, and (ii) the expected error of a 1-nearest-neighbor (1-NN) rule, which gives a data-driven upper bound. Across model sizes, we find that LLM learning curves are strongly influenced by the function-generating kernels and approach the GP lower bound as the number of demonstrations increases. We then study the inductive biases of these models using a likelihood-based analysis. We find that LLM predictions are most likely under less smooth GP kernels. Finally, we explore whether post-training can shift these inductive biases and improve sample-efficiency on functions sampled from GPs with smoother kernels. We find that both reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning can effectively shift inductive biases in the direction of the training data.

DPO weighs each update relative to a reference, which stabilizes the training by regularizing the updates within a trusted region. This reliance becomes problematic for pessimistic pairs, where the reference model prefers the rejected response. For these pairs, DPO prematurely attenuates the gradient as soon as the policy margin ($\u0394_\u03b8$) merely beats the reference margin ($\u0394_{\\mathrm{ref}}$) even if the policy is still wrong ($\u0394_\u03b8<0$). We name this failure premature satisfaction, which is a concrete form of the training-inference mismatch. Reference-free objectives remove this mismatch by optimizing the absolute margin, but at the cost of discarding the stabilizing signal of the reference. We mitigate this tension with Hybrid-DPO (HyPO), a drop-in modification to DPO that applies reference conditionally: HyPO behaves exactly like DPO when the reference is optimistic or neutral, and it treats the reference as neutral when it is pessimistic by replacing $\u0394_\u03b8-\u0394_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ with $\u0394_\u03b8-\\max\\{0,\u0394_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\}$. This one-line change strictly strengthens per-example learning signals on pessimistic pairs while preserving DPO's objective form and computational cost. By conditionally debiasing the pessimistic reference signal, HyPO mitigates premature satisfaction; empirically, across preference alignment, HyPO improves inference-aligned metrics and achieves higher pairwise win rates. Our results provide evidence that direct preference alignment could be enhanced by conditionally debiasing the reference signal, rather than discarding it.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyPO (Hybrid-DPO) fixes DPO's \"premature satisfaction\" problem by conditionally using the reference model - only when it's optimistic/neutral, treating it as neutral when pessimistic.

The learner receives a sample labeled by an unknown target concept from a known concept class, as in standard PAC learning. However, instead of learning the target concept itself, the goal is to predict, for each instance, the average label over its neighborhood -- an arbitrary subset of points that contains the instance. In the degenerate case where all neighborhoods are singletons, the problem reduces exactly to classic PAC learning. More generally, it extends PAC learning to a setting that captures learning tasks arising in several domains, including explainability, fairness, and recommendation systems. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of when conditional averages are learnable, together with sample complexity bounds that are tight up to logarithmic factors. The characterization hinges on the joint finiteness of two novel combinatorial parameters, which depend on both the concept class and the neighborhood system, and are closely related to the independence number of the associated neighborhood graph.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06PAC\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6807\u7b7e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u5e73\u5747\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7406\u8bba\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178PAC\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u90bb\u57df\u5e73\u5747\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53ca\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u70b9\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u7c7b\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5173\u8054\u90bb\u57df\u56fe\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6761\u4ef6\u5e73\u5747\u5728PAC\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u5168\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u5e73\u5747\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4ec5\u542b\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u67b6\u8d77\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178PAC\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u4e3a\u90bb\u57df\u5e73\u5747\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We extend and apply Puzzle, a post-training neural architecture search (NAS) framework, to gpt-oss-120B to produce gpt-oss-puzzle-88B, a deployment-optimized derivative. Our approach combines heterogeneous MoE expert pruning, selective replacement of full-context attention with window attention, FP8 KV-cache quantization with calibrated scales, and post-training reinforcement learning to recover accuracy, while maintaining low generation length. In terms of per-token speeds, on an 8XH100 node we achieve 1.63X and 1.22X throughput speedups in long-context and short-context settings, respectively. gpt-oss-puzzle-88B also delivers throughput speedups of 2.82X on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. However, because token counts can change with reasoning effort and model variants, per-token throughput (tok/s) and latency (ms/token) do not necessarily lead to end-to-end speedups: a 2X throughput gain is erased if traces grow 2X. Conversely, throughput gains can be spent on more reasoning tokens to improve accuracy; we therefore advocate request-level efficiency metrics that normalize throughput by tokens generated and trace an accuracy--speed frontier across reasoning efforts. We show that gpt-oss-puzzle-88B improves over gpt-oss-120B along the entire frontier, delivering up to 1.29X higher request-level efficiency. Across various benchmarks, gpt-oss-puzzle-88B matches or slightly exceeds the parent on suite-average accuracy across reasoning efforts, with retention ranging from 100.8% (high) to 108.2% (low), showing that post-training architecture search can substantially reduce inference costs without sacrificing quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u751f\u6210\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5bfc\u81f4\u670d\u52a1\u6210\u672c\u6fc0\u589e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55Puzzle\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ecegpt-oss-120B\u4f18\u5316\u51fagpt-oss-puzzle-88B\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5021\u5bfc\u4f7f\u7528\u8bf7\u6c42\u7ea7\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u63d0\u5347\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u989d\u5916token\u4f1a\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u670d\u52a1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Puzzle\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8egpt-oss-120B\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f02\u6784MoE\u4e13\u5bb6\u526a\u679d\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66ff\u6362\u3001FP8 KV\u7f13\u5b58\u91cf\u5316\u53ca\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u57288XH100\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\uff0c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b01.63\u500d\u548c1.22\u500d\u6bcftoken\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u5355\u5757H100 GPU\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52302.82\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u8bf7\u6c42\u7ea7\u6548\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53471.29\u500d\u3002gpt-oss-puzzle-88B\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u5230\u7236\u6a21\u578b\u7684100.8%\u81f3108.2%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6301\u5e73\u6216\u7565\u8d85\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u7531\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u957f\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\uff0c\u5355token\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5e94\u4f7f\u7528\u6309\u751f\u6210token\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\u7ea7\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed8\u5236\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u901f\u5ea6\u524d\u6cbf\u6765\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, existing attack methods in the forecasting field typically ignore the temporal consistency inherent in time series data, leading to divergent and contradictory perturbation values for the same timestamp across overlapping samples. This temporally inconsistent perturbations problem renders adversarial attacks impractical for real-world data manipulation. To address this, we introduce Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs), which enforce a temporal unification constraint to ensure identical perturbations for each timestamp across all overlapping samples. Moreover, we propose a novel Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) that provides a modular and efficient approach to effectively generate TUAPs by aggregating local gradient information from overlapping samples. By integrating TGAM with momentum-based attack algorithms, we ensure strict temporal consistency while fully utilizing series-level gradient information to explore the adversarial perturbation space. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four representative state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baselines in both white-box and black-box transfer attack scenarios under TUAP constraints. Moreover, our method also exhibits superior transfer attack performance even without TUAP constraints, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in generating adversarial perturbations for time series forecasting models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTUAPs\uff08\u65f6\u5e8f\u7edf\u4e00\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\uff09\u548cTGAM\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u68af\u5ea6\u7d2f\u79ef\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u76f8\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u805a\u5408\u91cd\u53e0\u6837\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u6570\u636e\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u540c\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u91cd\u53e0\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u77db\u76fe\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u6570\u636e\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u5e8f\u7edf\u4e00\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\uff08TUAPs\uff09\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u540c\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u5728\u6240\u6709\u91cd\u53e0\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5fc5\u987b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\n2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u68af\u5ea6\u7d2f\u79ef\u6cd5\uff08TGAM\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u805a\u5408\u91cd\u53e0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210TUAPs\u3002\n3. \u5c06TGAM\u4e0e\u52a8\u91cf\u653b\u51fb\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u63a2\u7d22\u6270\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u57283\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c4\u79cdSOTA\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728TUAP\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u767d\u76d2/\u9ed1\u76d2\u8fc1\u79fb\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u65e0TUAP\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5176\u8fc1\u79fb\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u4ecd\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "TUAPs\u548cTGAM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Especially when decisions have a direct impact on humans, this can be highly unsatisfactory. For a person subject to high disagreement between models, one could as well have chosen a different model of similar overall accuracy that would have decided the person's case differently. We argue that this arbitrariness conflicts with the EU AI Act, which requires providers of high-risk AI systems to report performance not only at the dataset level but also for specific persons. The goal of this paper is to put predictive multiplicity in context with the EU AI Act's provisions on accuracy and to subsequently derive concrete suggestions on how to evaluate and report predictive multiplicity in practice. Specifically: (1) We argue that incorporating information about predictive multiplicity can serve compliance with the EU AI Act's accuracy provisions for providers.

This nonstationarity challenges theoretical analysis, as it violates classical assumptions of i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) samples, necessitating algorithms capable of real-time updates without expensive retraining. An effective approach should process each sample in a single pass, while maintaining computational and memory complexities independent of the data stream length. Motivated by these challenges, this paper investigates the Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm as an adaptive identification tool, leveraging its computational simplicity and online processing capabilities. Theoretically, we derive tracking performance and regret bounds for the MLMS in time-varying stochastic linear systems under various practical conditions. Unlike classical LMS, whose stability can be characterized by first-order random vector difference equations, MLMS introduces an additional dynamical state due to momentum, leading to second-order time-varying random vector difference equations whose stability analysis hinges on more complicated products of random matrices, which poses a substantially challenging problem to resolve. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that MLMS achieves rapid adaptation and robust tracking, in agreement with our theoretical results especially in nonstationary settings, highlighting its promise for modern streaming and online learning applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52a8\u91cf\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9(MLMS)\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5176\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u65f6\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5448\u73b0\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff08\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u65f6\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u8fdd\u53cd\u4f20\u7edfi.i.d.\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u957f\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5355\u904d\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u91cf\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9(MLMS)\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fa8\u8bc6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u5176\u5728\u65f6\u53d8\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u6d89\u53ca\u4e8c\u9636\u65f6\u53d8\u968f\u673a\u5411\u91cf\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u79ef\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5206\u6790\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MLMS\u5728\u65f6\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMLMS\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "MLMS\u7b97\u6cd5\u56e0\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

The first module performs competence-based expert selection by building a lightweight confidence graph from auxiliary data to identify the most suitable clients for each question. The second module leverages the \"Group Relative\" concept from the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by packaging each question together with its solution rationale into candidate policies, dispatching these policies to a selected subset of expert clients, and aggregating solely the resulting scalar reward signals via a federated group-relative loss function.

This execution pattern repeatedly processes the same prompt prefix across models. Consequently, each model redundantly executes the prefill stage and maintains its own key-value (KV) cache, increasing aggregate prefill load and worsening tail latency by intensifying prefill-decode interference in existing LLM serving stacks. Disaggregated serving reduces such interference by placing prefill and decode on separate GPUs, but disaggregation does not fundamentally eliminate inter-model redundancy in computation and KV storage for the same prompt. To address this issue, we propose PrefillShare, a novel algorithm that enables sharing the prefill stage across multiple models in a disaggregated setting. PrefillShare factorizes the model into prefill and decode modules, freezes the prefill module, and fine-tunes only the decode module. This design allows multiple task-specific models to share a prefill module and the KV cache generated for the same prompt. We further introduce a routing mechanism that enables effective prefill sharing across heterogeneous models in a vLLM-based disaggregated system. PrefillShare not only matches full fine-tuning accuracy on a broad range of tasks and models, but also delivers 4.5x lower p95 latency and 3.9x higher throughput in multi-model agent workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u590d\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u540cprompt\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u586b\u5145\u5197\u4f59\u548cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u6d6a\u8d39\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPrefillShare\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u6a21\u5757\u5e76\u5171\u4eab\u9884\u586b\u5145\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u540c\u7684prompt\u524d\u7f00\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u8981\u72ec\u7acb\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u586b\u5145\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u7ef4\u62a4\u5404\u81ea\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u603b\u4f53\u9884\u586b\u5145\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u8fd8\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u9884\u586b\u5145-\u89e3\u7801\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u6076\u5316\u4e86\u5c3e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u5f0f\u670d\u52a1\u90e8\u7f72\u867d\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6d88\u9664\u76f8\u540cprompt\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPrefillShare\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u586b\u5145\u6a21\u5757\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u89e3\u7801\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5171\u4eab\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u586b\u5145\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8evLLM\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9884\u586b\u5145\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "result": "PrefillShare\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864.5\u500d\u7684p95\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u548c3.9\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "PrefillShare\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u9884\u586b\u5145\u8ba1\u7b97\u548cKV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Duersch", "Elohan Veillon", "Astrid Klipfel", "Adlane Sayede", "Zied Bouraoui"], "title": "Fourier Transformers for Latent Crystallographic Diffusion and Generative Modeling", "comment": null, "summary": "The discovery of new crystalline materials calls for generative models that handle periodic boundary conditions, crystallographic symmetries, and physical constraints, while scaling to large and structurally diverse unit cells. We propose a reciprocal-space generative pipeline that represents crystals through a truncated Fourier transform of the species-resolved unit-cell density, rather than modeling atomic coordinates directly. This representation is periodicity-native, admits simple algebraic actions of space-group symmetries, and naturally supports variable atomic multiplicities during generation, addressing a common limitation of particle-based approaches. Using only nine Fourier basis functions per spatial dimension, our approach reconstructs unit cells containing up to 108 atoms per chemical species. We instantiate this pipeline with a transformer variational autoencoder over complex-valued Fourier coefficients, and a latent diffusion model that generates in the compressed latent space. We evaluate reconstruction and latent diffusion on the LeMaterial benchmark and compare unconditional generation against coordinate-based baselines in the small-cell regime ($\\leq 16$ atoms per unit cell).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5012\u6613\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5468\u671f\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Transformer VAE\u548c\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6750\u6599\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6676\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u6676\u4f53\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6676\u80de\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u53d8\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5012\u6613\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u622a\u65ad\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u8868\u793a\u6676\u80de\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u503c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7cfb\u6570\u7684Transformer\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u7528\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea69\u4e2a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u91cd\u5efa\u6bcf\u7c7b\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u79cd\u591a\u8fbe108\u4e2a\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u6676\u80de\uff0c\u5728LeMaterial\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6676\u80de\uff08\u226416\u539f\u5b50\uff09\u7684\u5750\u6807\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u539f\u751f\u652f\u6301\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u4ee3\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6676\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although prior work has explored automatic event detection using player and ball trajectories, ball tracking also remains difficult to scale due to high infrastructural and operational costs. As a result, comprehensive data collection in soccer is largely confined to top-tier competitions, limiting the broader adoption of data-driven analysis in this domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes PathCRF, a framework for detecting on-ball soccer events using only player tracking data. We model player trajectories as a fully connected dynamic graph and formulate event detection as the problem of selecting exactly one edge corresponding to the current possession state at each time step. To ensure logical consistency of the resulting edge sequence, we employ a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that forbids impossible transitions between consecutive edges. Both emission and transition scores dynamically computed from edge embeddings produced by a Set Attention-based backbone architecture. During inference, the most probable edge sequence is obtained via Viterbi decoding, and events such as ball controls or passes are detected whenever the selected edge changes between adjacent time steps. Experiments show that PathCRF produces accurate, logically consistent possession paths, enabling reliable downstream analyses while substantially reducing the need for manual event annotation.

We study Empirical GPs, a principled framework for constructing flexible, data-driven GP priors that overcome these limitations. Rather than relying on standard parametric kernels, we estimate the mean and covariance functions empirically from a corpus of historical observations, enabling the prior to reflect rich, non-trivial covariance structures present in the data. Theoretically, we show that the resulting model converges to the GP that is closest (in KL-divergence sense) to the real data generating process. Practically, we formulate the problem of learning the GP prior from independent datasets as likelihood estimation and derive an Expectation-Maximization algorithm with closed-form updates, allowing the model handle heterogeneous observation locations across datasets.

Traditional approaches rely on probabilistic models to account for the uncertainty, but often require explicit noise assumptions, in turn limiting generalization. In this work, we contribute a novel method to learn a structured latent representation, in which distances between states directly correlate with the minimum number of actions required to transition between them. The proposed metric space formulation provides a geometric interpretation of uncertainty without the need for explicit probabilistic modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a multimodal latent transition model and a sensor fusion mechanism based on inverse distance weighting, allowing for the adaptive integration of multiple sensor modalities without prior knowledge of noise distributions.

We propose Meta-Sel, a lightweight supervised meta-learning approach for intent classification that learns a fast, interpretable scoring function for (candidate, query) pairs from labeled training data.\n  Meta-Sel constructs a meta-dataset by sampling pairs from the training split and using class agreement as supervision, then trains a calibrated logistic regressor on two inexpensive meta-features: TF--IDF cosine similarity and a length-compatibility ratio. At inference time, the selector performs a single vectorized scoring pass over the full candidate pool and returns the top-k demonstrations, requiring no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls. This yields deterministic rankings and makes the selection mechanism straightforward to audit via interpretable feature weights.\n  Beyond proposing Meta-Sel, we provide a broad empirical study of demonstration selection, benchmarking 12 methods -- spanning prompt engineering baselines, heuristic selection, reinforcement learning, and influence-based approaches -- across four intent datasets and five open-source LLMs. Across this benchmark, Meta-Sel consistently ranks among the top-performing methods, is particularly effective for smaller models where selection quality can partially compensate for limited model capacity, and maintains competitive selection-time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Meta-Sel\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7TF-IDF\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u6bd4\u7387\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u5019\u9009\u793a\u4f8b-\u67e5\u8be2\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6f14\u793a\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff08\u5982\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u63a2\u7d22\u6216\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u5ec9\u4ef7\u53c8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u5143\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u7c7b\u522b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528TF-IDF\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u517c\u5bb9\u6bd4\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5143\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u4ece\u5019\u9009\u6c60\u9009\u51faTop-k\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u989d\u5916\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u610f\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c5\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMeta-Sel\u572812\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u80fd\u5f25\u8865\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u9009\u62e9\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b", "conclusion": "Meta-Sel\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u74f6\u9888\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Github repo: https://github.com/RUCBM/G-OPD", "summary": "On-policy distillation (OPD), which aligns the student with the teacher's logit distribution on student-generated trajectories, has demonstrated strong empirical gains in improving student performance and often outperforms off-policy distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms. In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead.

Standard evaluations often test latent capability via downstream adaptation (e.g., fine-tuning or high-capacity probes), but such interventions can change the representations being measured and thus confound what was learned during self-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $\u03c1> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($\u03c1\\approx 0.05$).

However, they assume uniform time intervals and therefore struggle with irregular time series. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) effectively handle irregular time series by modelling hidden states as continuously evolving trajectories. ContiFormers arxiv:2402.10635 combine NODEs with Transformers, but inherit the computational bottleneck of the former by using heavy numerical solvers. This bottleneck can be removed by using a closed-form solution for the given dynamical system - but this is known to be intractable in general! We obviate this by replacing NODEs with a novel linear damped harmonic oscillator analogy - which has a known closed-form solution. We model keys and values as damped, driven oscillators and expand the query in a sinusoidal basis up to a suitable number of modes. This analogy naturally captures the query-key coupling that is fundamental to any transformer architecture by modelling attention as a resonance phenomenon. Our closed-form solution eliminates the computational overhead of numerical ODE solvers while preserving expressivity. We prove that this oscillator-based parameterisation maintains the universal approximation property of continuous-time attention; specifically, any discrete attention matrix realisable by ContiFormer's continuous keys can be approximated arbitrarily well by our fixed oscillator modes.

While existing mixing methods show promise, they fall short when applied during real-world LM development. We present Olmix, a framework that addresses two such challenges. First, the configuration space for developing a mixing method is not well understood -- design choices across existing methods lack justification or consensus and overlook practical issues like data constraints. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method. Second, in practice, the domain set evolves throughout LM development as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised -- a problem setting largely unaddressed by existing works, which assume fixed domains. We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update. Over a sequence of five domain-set updates mirroring real-world LM development, mixture reuse matches the performance of fully recomputing the mix after each update with 74% less compute and improves over training without mixing by 11.6% on downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Olmix is a framework for efficient data mixing in language model training that addresses two key challenges: understanding the configuration space of mixing methods and handling evolving domain sets through mixture reuse.", "motivation": "Data mixing ratios are crucial for training language models, but existing methods fall short in real-world development because: (1) the configuration space for mixing methods lacks understanding and justification, and (2) they assume fixed domains while real-world domains evolve through additions, removals, and revisions during development.", "method": "The paper presents Olmix framework with two components: (1) a comprehensive empirical study identifying key design choices for effective mixing methods, and (2) mixture reuse mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes only for affected domains when domain sets are updated, leveraging past mixture information.", "result": "Over five domain-set updates mirroring real-world LM development, mixture reuse achieves performance matching full recomputation while using 74% less compute, and improves over training without mixing by 11.6% on downstream tasks.", "conclusion": "Olmix successfully addresses practical challenges in data mixing for LM development by providing a better understanding of mixing configuration space and an efficient mechanism for handling evolving domain sets, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining performance."}}

To bridge these gaps, we introduce TIME, a next-generation task-centric benchmark comprising 50 fresh datasets and 98 forecasting tasks, tailored for strict zero-shot TSFM evaluation free from data leakage. Integrating large language models and human expertise, we establish a rigorous human-in-the-loop benchmark construction pipeline to ensure high data integrity and redefine task formulation by aligning forecasting configurations with real-world operational requirements and variate predictability.

However, recent studies show that safety behaviors are concentrated in a small subset of parameters, making alignment brittle and easily bypassed through neuron-level attacks. Moreover, most existing alignment methods operate at the behavioral level, offering limited control over the model's internal safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SafeNeuron, a neuron-level safety alignment framework that improves robustness by redistributing safety representations across the network. SafeNeuron first identifies safety-related neurons, then freezes these neurons during preference optimization to prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways and force the model to construct redundant safety representations.

We then analyze iterative alignment dynamics in which the learned policy feeds back into future sampling and reference policies, reflecting a common practice of model-generated preference data.

Building on recent variational formulations of flow matching and the broader trend towards accelerated inference in diffusion and flow-based models, we define a flow map towards the simplex that transports probability mass toward a predicted endpoint, yielding a parametrisation that naturally constrains model predictions. Since our trajectories are continuous rather than discrete, Categorical Flow Maps can be trained with existing distillation techniques, as well as a new objective based on endpoint consistency. This continuous formulation also automatically unlocks test-time inference: we can directly reuse existing guidance and reweighting techniques in the categorical setting to steer sampling toward downstream objectives.

However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes.
