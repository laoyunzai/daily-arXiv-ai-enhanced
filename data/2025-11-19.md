### [1] [Imagine in Space: Exploring the Frontier of Spatial Intelligence and Reasoning Efficiency in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13782)
*Xiaoxing Lian,Aidong Yang,Jun Zhu,Peng Wang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SpatiaLite基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，发现当前先进VLMs主要依赖语言表示进行空间推理，在视觉中心任务上表现不足且效率低下，并提出了Imagery Driven Framework来改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型和视觉语言模型在逻辑推理、问题解决等方面表现出色，但空间推理（如心理旋转、导航、空间关系理解）仍然是当前先进VLMs的重大挑战。作者假设想象力（空间状态内部模拟）是空间世界模型中的主导推理机制。

Method: 引入SpatiaLite完全合成基准测试，联合测量空间推理准确性和效率；提出Imagery Driven Framework（IDF）用于数据合成和训练，隐式构建内部世界模型。

Result: 发现三个关键结果：1）先进VLMs主要依赖语言表示进行推理和想象，在需要感知空间关系和3D几何变换的视觉中心任务上存在显著缺陷；2）当前空间推理机制效率严重低下，随着变换复杂度增加，token使用量快速增长；3）IDF框架可以隐式构建对空间推理至关重要的内部世界模型。

Conclusion: 基于SpatiaLite，本研究描绘了先进VLMs的空间推理限制和模式，识别了关键缺陷，并为未来进展提供了信息。IDF框架为解决VLM空间推理问题提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances

### [2] [Causal computations in Semi Markovian Structural Causal Models using divide and conquer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13852)
*Anna Rodum Bjøru,Rafael Cabañas,Helge Langseth,Antonio Salmerón*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了将Bjøru等人提出的用于马尔可夫结构因果模型的因果概率边界计算方法扩展到半马尔可夫模型，其中外生变量可以影响多个内生变量，从而能够表示马尔可夫模型无法表示的混杂关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bjøru等人的方法仅适用于马尔可夫模型，其中每个外生变量只影响单个内生变量。但在实际应用中，半马尔可夫模型能够表示更复杂的混杂关系，因此需要扩展该方法以处理更一般的因果模型。

Method: 通过最小示例说明扩展的挑战，并提出一组替代解决方案策略。这些策略在理论上和计算研究中进行了评估。

Result: 研究揭示了将马尔可夫模型的因果概率边界计算方法扩展到半马尔可夫模型时面临的技术挑战，并提出并评估了多种解决方案策略。

Conclusion: 将因果概率边界计算方法从马尔可夫模型扩展到半马尔可夫模型是可行的，但需要解决由外生变量影响多个内生变量带来的新挑战，为此提出了有效的替代策略。

Abstract: Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.

### [3] [Jailbreaking Large Vision Language Models in Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13892)
*Badhan Chandra Das,Md Tasnim Jawad,Md Jueal Mia,M. Hadi Amini,Yanzhao Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了智能交通系统中大型视觉语言模型在精心设计的越狱攻击下的脆弱性，提出了一种利用图像排版操纵和多轮提示的新型越狱攻击方法，并设计了多层响应过滤防御技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在智能交通系统中应用广泛，但它们对越狱攻击高度脆弱，可能产生有害响应，需要系统分析其安全漏洞并开发有效防御方法。

Method: 构建交通相关有害查询数据集；开发基于图像排版操纵和多轮提示的新型越狱攻击；提出多层响应过滤防御技术；使用GPT-4判断和人工验证评估攻击和防御效果。

Result: 实验表明提出的越狱攻击方法对开源和闭源LVLMs都有效，相比现有技术具有更强的攻击能力；多层防御技术能有效阻止模型生成不当响应。

Conclusion: LVLMs在ITS中存在严重安全风险，图像排版操纵和多轮提示的越狱攻击威胁显著，需要多层防御机制来保护系统安全。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.

### [4] [CORGI: Efficient Pattern Matching With Quadratic Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13942)
*Daniel Weitekamp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CORGI是一种新的模式匹配算法，针对规则系统中指数级时间和空间复杂度问题，提供二次时间空间保证，能够迭代流式输出匹配结果，避免内存溢出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时AI系统和数据库查询中规则匹配的指数级复杂度问题，特别是当AI系统自动生成规则时容易产生最坏情况匹配模式，导致程序执行缓慢或内存耗尽。

Method: 采用两步法：前向传递构建/维护接地关系图，后向迭代器按需生成匹配，不同于RETE的β-内存收集部分匹配的方法。

Result: 在性能评估中，CORGI在简单组合匹配任务上显著优于SOAR和OPS5的RETE实现。

Conclusion: CORGI算法通过消除传统冲突集的内存负担，为实时应用提供了可预测的性能保证，解决了规则匹配中的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

### [5] [Scene Graph-Guided Generative AI Framework for Synthesizing and Evaluating Industrial Hazard Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13970)
*Sanjay Acharjee,Abir Khan Ratul,Diego Patino,Md Nazmus Sakib*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于场景图引导的生成AI框架，利用OSHA事故报告生成逼真的工作场所危险场景图像，并通过VQA图评分评估生成数据的真实性和语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练视觉模型准确检测工作场所危险需要真实的不安全状况图像，但由于难以捕捉实际发生的事故触发场景，获取此类数据集具有挑战性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o分析OSHA叙述提取结构化危险推理，转换为对象级场景图捕获空间和上下文关系，然后指导文本到图像扩散模型生成构图准确的危险场景。

Result: 提出的VQA图评分在基于熵的验证中优于CLIP和BLIP指标，确认其具有更高的区分敏感性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效合成逼真的危险场景图像，为工作场所安全检测模型的训练提供了可行的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

### [6] [ALEX:A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14018)
*Minghu Wang,Shuliang Zhao,Yuanyuan Zhao,Hongxia Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALEX是一个轻量级知识编辑框架，通过分层内存架构将知识更新组织成语义聚类，将检索复杂度从O(N)降低到O(K+N/C)，显著提升多跳问答准确性和推理路径可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的知识是静态的，难以适应不断变化的信息，现有方法在处理需要多步推理的复杂多跳问题时面临可扩展性和检索效率的挑战。

Method: ALEX采用分层内存架构组织知识更新，包含推理查询合成模块来弥合查询与事实之间的语义鸿沟，以及动态证据裁决引擎执行高效的两阶段检索过程。

Result: 在MQUAKE基准测试中，ALEX显著提高了多跳答案的准确性和推理路径的可靠性，同时将所需搜索空间减少了80%以上。

Conclusion: ALEX为构建可扩展、高效且准确的知识编辑系统提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.

### [7] [Syn-STARTS: Synthesized START Triage Scenario Generation Framework for Scalable LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14023)
*Chiharu Hagiwara,Naoki Nonaka,Yuhta Hashimoto,Ryu Uchimido,Jun Seita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Syn-STARTS是一个使用LLMs生成大规模分类案例的框架，在质量上与人工整理的数据集难以区分，为开发高性能医疗AI模型提供了可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模伤亡事件中分类决策至关重要，但真实数据难以收集。AI开发需要足够数量和质量的基准数据集，而真实场景数据稀缺。

Method: 开发Syn-STARTS框架，利用LLMs生成分类案例，并与人工整理的TRIAGE开放数据集进行质量对比验证。

Result: Syn-STARTS生成的分类案例在质量上与人工整理的数据集难以区分，使用START标准分类方法评估LLM准确性时结果高度稳定。

Conclusion: 合成数据在开发严重和关键医疗情境下的高性能AI模型方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.

*Amirreza Mehrabi,Jason W. Morphew,Breejha Quezada,N. Sanjay Rebello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种由教师主导的反馈循环系统，将概念级评估证据转化为经过验证的微干预措施，通过三个保障机制（充分性、注意力预算和多样性）实现精准的个性化学习干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自适应学习系统存在诊断精确但干预薄弱的问题，导致帮助时机不当或内容不匹配。研究旨在解决诊断与教学之间的脱节，实现更有效的个性化学习。

Method: 将干预分配形式化为带约束的二元整数规划，包括覆盖范围、时间、难度窗口、概念矩阵编码的先决条件以及通过多样性强制执行的抗冗余性。采用贪心选择、基于梯度的松弛和混合方法三种求解策略。

Result: 在1204名学生的物理课程部署中，两种求解器都能在有限观看时间内为几乎所有学习者实现完整的技能覆盖。基于梯度的方法相比贪心法减少了约12个百分点的冗余覆盖，并在难度上更均衡，而贪心法在资源稀缺环境下以较低计算成本实现相当的效果。

Conclusion: 该系统构建了一个可追踪且可审计的控制器，闭合了诊断-教学循环，在课堂规模下实现了公平、负载感知的个性化学习。

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

TL;DR: APD-agents是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于自动化移动应用页面设计，通过多个专业智能体的协作将用户描述转换为高质量的页面布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动应用页面布局设计耗时且需要专业技能，现有设计软件使用门槛高，跨页面协作设计需要额外时间保证一致性。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，包含编排智能体、语义解析智能体、主布局智能体、模板检索智能体和递归组件智能体，通过智能体协作将用户描述转换为结构化数据并生成页面布局。

Result: 在RICO数据集上的实验结果表明，APD-agents达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该工作充分利用了大模型驱动的多智能体系统的自动协作能力，为移动应用页面设计提供了高效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出R3框架，通过双过程思维整合LLM的泛化能力和VLN专业模型，在零样本设置下解决视觉语言导航任务中的空间理解问题和计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在视觉语言导航任务中仍存在性能差距，主要因为LLM难以精确理解真实世界空间关系，且计算成本高、推理延迟大。

Method: 提出R3双过程思维框架，包含三个核心模块：Runner（轻量级专家模型）、Ruminator（多模态LLM推理模块）和Regulator（思维模式控制器），通过链式思维提示实现结构化推理。

Result: 在REVERIE基准测试中，R3显著优于其他最先进方法，SPL和RGSPL分别提升3.28%和3.30%。

Conclusion: R3框架有效处理了具有挑战性的VLN任务，证明了双过程思维在整合LLM泛化能力和领域专业知识方面的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.

### [11] [Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Understand Chronology?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14214)
*Pattaraphon Kenny Wongchamcharoen,Paul Glasserman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 测试大型语言模型对时间顺序的理解能力，发现在金融应用中避免前瞻性偏差需要模型理解时间顺序。随着序列长度增加，模型在保持全局一致时间线方面存在困难，但分配显式推理预算可以显著改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融和经济学应用中，大型语言模型经常被用于处理时间序列数据，但模型是否真正理解时间顺序这一基本问题尚未得到充分验证。需要测试模型在已知事实的基础上处理时间顺序任务的能力。

Method: 设计了一系列时间顺序任务，包括：1）时间顺序排序；2）条件排序（先过滤后排序）；3）时代错误检测。评估了GPT-4.1、Claude-3.7 Sonnet（有/无扩展思维）和GPT-5在不同推理努力设置下的表现。

Result: 随着序列长度增加，所有模型的精确匹配率急剧下降，但排名相关性保持较高。在条件排序中，大多数失败源于过滤步骤而非排序步骤。GPT-5和带扩展思维的Claude-3.7 Sonnet表现显著优于普通模型。时代错误检测是最简单的任务，但性能仍随时间线或实体重叠增加而下降。

Conclusion: 分配显式推理预算有助于改善时间顺序排序，GPT-5在中等/高推理努力下在所有长度上实现了完美排序和完美条件排序。当前LLM在时间顺序任务上存在局限性，这些发现对LLM在金融领域的实时应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出两阶段架构来减少Whisper模型的幻觉错误：第一阶段使用自适应层注意力增强编码器鲁棒性，第二阶段通过多目标知识蒸馏抑制幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper模型在噪声条件下经常出现幻觉错误，而现有方法主要关注音频预处理或转录后处理，对模型本身的修改研究较少。

Method: 1. 自适应层注意力(ALA)：通过层间相关性分析将编码器层分组，使用可学习多头注意力融合块表示；2. 多目标知识蒸馏：在噪声音频上训练学生模型，使其语义和注意力分布与处理干净输入的教师模型对齐。

Result: 在噪声语音基准测试中显著减少了幻觉和词错误率，同时在干净语音上保持了性能。

Conclusion: ALA和KD为改善Whisper在真实世界噪声条件下的可靠性提供了原则性策略。

Abstract: The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.

Motivation: 现有推荐模型难以处理物联网设备操作的复杂逻辑、多样化用户偏好以及对次优建议的敏感性，限制了其在物联网设备操作推荐中的应用。

Method: 1. 通过持续预训练和多任务微调为LLM提供物联网操作领域知识；2. 使用直接偏好优化使微调后的LLM与特定用户偏好对齐；3. 设计基于置信度的曝光控制机制避免低质量推荐带来的负面用户体验。

Conclusion: DevPiolt通过结合领域知识、用户偏好对齐和置信度控制，有效解决了物联网设备操作推荐中的挑战，在实际应用中取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

### [14] [Enhancing Regional Airbnb Trend Forecasting Using LLM-Based Embeddings of Accessibility and Human Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14248)
*Hongju Lee,Youngjun Park,Jisun An,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的区域级Airbnb市场预测框架，通过整合房源特征和外部环境因素构建区域表征，使用时间序列模型预测未来1-3个月的收入、预订天数和预订数量，在首尔数据集上比传统方法降低RMSE和MAE约48%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短期租赁平台（如Airbnb）的扩张严重扰乱了当地住房市场，导致租金上涨和住房负担能力问题。准确预测区域Airbnb市场趋势可为政策制定者和城市规划者提供关键见解，以减轻这些影响。

Method: 采用滑动窗口方法，将结构化表格数据转换为基于提示的LLM输入，生成全面的区域嵌入，然后输入到先进的时间序列模型（RNN、LSTM、Transformer）中，以更好地捕捉复杂的时空动态。

Result: 在首尔Airbnb数据集上的实验表明，该方法与传统基线（包括传统统计和机器学习模型）相比，平均RMSE和MAE降低了约48%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提高了预测准确性，还为检测供应过剩区域和支持数据驱动的城市政策决策提供了实用见解。

Abstract: The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

*Yu Liu,Xixun Lin,Yanmin Shang,Yangxi Li,Shi Wang,Yanan Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PathMind是一个新颖的知识图谱推理框架，通过选择性引导LLMs使用重要推理路径来增强忠实和可解释的推理。它采用“检索-优先化-推理”范式，包括路径优先化机制和双阶段训练策略，在复杂推理任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的知识图谱推理方法存在两个关键限制：1）不加区分地提取推理路径，可能引入无关噪声误导LLMs；2）动态探索推理路径需要高检索需求和频繁LLM调用。

Method: PathMind采用“检索-优先化-推理”范式：首先检索查询子图，然后通过语义感知路径优先级函数识别重要推理路径（同时考虑累积成本和估计未来成本），最后通过双阶段训练策略（任务特定指令微调和路径偏好对齐）生成准确响应。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，PathMind始终优于竞争基线，特别是在复杂推理任务上，通过识别基本推理路径，使用更少的输入token实现更好性能。

Conclusion: PathMind通过选择性引导LLMs使用重要推理路径，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了更忠实、可解释和高效的知识图谱推理。

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

### [16] [When Words Change the Model: Sensitivity of LLMs for Constraint Programming Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14334)
*Alessio Pellegrino,Jacopo Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过系统性地重述和扰动经典CSPLib问题，测试LLMs在自动生成优化模型时的真实推理能力，发现其表现对上下文和语言变化高度敏感，表明其理解较浅。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验LLMs自动生成优化模型的能力是否源于数据污染而非真正推理，因为许多标准CP问题可能已包含在其训练数据中。

Method: 系统性地重述和扰动一组知名CSPLib问题，保持结构不变但修改上下文并引入误导元素，然后比较三个代表性LLM在原始和修改描述下生成的模型。

Result: LLMs能生成语法有效且语义合理的模型，但在上下文和语言变化下性能急剧下降，显示出浅层理解和对措辞的敏感性。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动生成优化模型方面的成功可能更多源于数据污染而非真正的推理能力，其对语言变化的敏感性揭示了其理解的局限性。

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在LLM对齐过程中纳入多元社会价值观的影响，通过系统评估人口统计差异和设计参数，发现不同社会群体对模型响应的评价存在显著差异，且技术设计选择对模型行为有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM越来越多地使用人类反馈进行安全和对齐训练，但对齐决策往往忽视人类社会的多样性。本研究旨在探讨纳入多元价值观如何影响LLM行为。

Method: 从美国和德国参与者收集对齐数据，在五个维度上评估LLM响应。使用不同社会群体的偏好微调多个大型语言模型和推理模型，同时改变评分尺度、分歧处理方法和优化技术。

Result: 发现系统性人口统计效应：男性参与者对毒性的评分比女性低18%；保守派和黑人参与者对情感意识的评分分别比自由派和白人参与者高27.9%和44%。技术设计选择显示强烈影响：保留评分者分歧比多数投票实现约53%更大的毒性减少；5点量表比二元格式产生约22%更多减少；DPO在多值优化中始终优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 这些发现是回答关键问题的初步步骤：对齐应如何平衡专家驱动和用户驱动的信号，以确保安全性和公平代表性。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

Abstract: Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.

Conclusion: 关注高效用片段支持任务可识别性，并为更有效的上下文学习提示设计提供信息，SkillGen框架在顺序推理任务中实现了持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to sequential decision-making through in-context learning (ICL), yet their effectiveness is highly sensitive to prompt quality. Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design. Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, show that SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于异构智能体强化学习（HARL）的配电网恢复方法，通过HAPPO算法协调互联微电网的恢复操作，解决了传统优化方法计算效率低和难以扩展的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模停电后配电网恢复需要顺序开关操作和分布式能源资源协调，传统优化方法和基于价值的强化学习方法在非线性约束下计算效率低且难以扩展。

Method: 采用异构智能体强化学习框架，通过HAPPO算法实现微电网间的协调恢复，每个智能体控制具有不同负载、DER容量和开关数量的微电网，使用去中心化执行器策略和集中式评论家进行训练。

Result: 在IEEE 123总线和IEEE 8500节点系统上的实验表明，HAPPO相比DQN、PPO等方法具有更快的收敛速度、更高的恢复功率和更平滑的多种子训练效果。

Conclusion: 在HARL框架中引入微电网级异构性，为复杂配电网恢复问题提供了可扩展、稳定且约束感知的解决方案。

Abstract: Restoring power distribution systems (PDS) after large-scale outages requires sequential switching operations that reconfigure feeder topology and coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) under nonlinear constraints such as power balance, voltage limits, and thermal ratings. These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.

Conclusion: 该方法为在链复形框架下系统构造KW对偶缺陷提供了有效途径，扩展了先前的研究成果。

Abstract: Defects associated with non-invertible symmetries have attracted significant attention in recent years. Among them, Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality defects have been investigated in both classical statistical systems and quantum Hamiltonian models. Aasen et al. analyzed duality defects in the 2D Ising model and in statistical models built from fusion categories, while Koide et al. later constructed a duality defect in 4D lattice gauge theory. In this work, we extend these developments by providing a systematic construction of KW duality defects/KW defects for a broad class of models formulated within the chain complex framework. Our construction employs the strange correlator, an overlap between a topologically ordered state and a product state, to realize these KW defects.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids can arise from Kitaev magnetic interactions, and exhibit fractionalized excitations with the potential for a topological form of quantum computation. This review surveys recent experimental and theoretical progress on the pursuit of phenomena related to Kitaev magnetism in layered and exfoliatable materials, which offer numerous opportunities to apply powerful techniques from the field of atomically thin materials. We primarily focus on the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $α$-RuCl3, which exhibits Kitaev couplings and is readily exfoliated to single- or few-layer sheets, and thus serves as a test bed for developing probes of Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials and devices. We introduce the Kitaev model and how it is realized in $α$-RuCl3 and other material candidates; and cover $α$-RuCl3 synthesis and fabrication into van der Waals heterostructure devices. A key discovery is a work-function-mediated charge transfer that heavily dopes both the $α$-RuCl3 and proximate materials, and can enhance Kitaev interactions by up to 50%. We further discuss a wide range of recent results in electronic transport and optical and tunneling spectroscopies of $α$-RuCl3 devices. The experimental techniques and theoretical insights developed for $α$-RuCl3 establish a framework for discovering and engineering superior two-dimensional Kitaev materials that may ultimately realize elusive quantum spin liquid phases.

Abstract: Layered van der Waals crystals of topologically non-trivial and trivial semimetals with antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of magnetic sublattice are known to exhibit a negative magnetoresistance that is well correlated with AFM magnetization changes in a magnetic field. This effect is reported in several experimental studies with EuFe2As2, EuSn2As2, EuSn2P2, etc., where the resistance decreases quadratically with field by about 5% up to the spin-polarization field. Although this effect is well documented experimentally, its theoretical explanation is missing up to date. Here, we propose a theoretical mechanism describing the observed magnetoresistance that is inherent in AFM metals and is based on violation the binary T2 symmetry. It is almost isotropic to the field and current directions, contrary to the known mechanisms such as giant magnetoresistance and chiral anomaly. The proposed intrinsic mechanism of magnetoresistance is strong in a wide class of the layered AFM-ordered semimetals. The theoretically calculated magnetoresistance is qualitatively consistent with experimental data for crystals of various composition.

Abstract: We investigated the isotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on an anisotropic square lattice with competing exchange interactions, motivated by the unconventional magnetic behavior observed in the verdazyl-based compound (o-MePy-V)PF6. Using a cluster mean-field approach, we explore a field-induced phase stabilized by the interplay between frustration and quantum fluctuations, focusing on the role of exchange interactions. We identify: (i) the formation of spin singlet pairs, signaled by enhanced spin-spin correlations in specific field regimes; and (ii) a one-half magnetization plateau, emerging from a subtle balance between competing exchange couplings and field-enhanced quantum fluctuations. Our results reveal that an enhancement of frustration, achieved by tuning small variations in the spatially anisotropic exchange interactions of the compound (o-MePy-V)PF6, can stabilize a field-induced quantum phase where ferromagnetism coexists with antiferromagnetic dimers. Our results provide microscopic insight into the mechanisms driving these nontrivial phases and offer theoretical support for interpreting experimental observations in this class of low-dimensional quantum magnets.

Result: CMRT成功预测了B1到B2相的一阶相变，11%体积坍塌，4f谱权重展宽，轨道占据增加，与导带态杂化增强，与实验观测高度一致。

Conclusion: CMRT能够无参数地准确描述和预测稀土化合物中相关驱动的结构和电子相变，为理解这类复杂系统提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We apply correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) to cerium nitride (CeN) under pressure. For B1 (NaCl-type) phase, CMRT gives an equation of state consistent with ambient pressure experiments. It produces electronic density-of-state (DOS) characterized by a sharp 4f quasi-particle resonance peak pinned at the Fermi level and two subbands formed by strong hybridization between the localized Ce-4f electrons and the itinerant Ce-5d and N-2p electrons below the Fermi level, consistent with XPS experiments. Upon compression, CMRT predicts a first-order B1 to B2 (CsCl-type) transition with ~11% volume collapse. Across the transition, the 4f spectral weight broadens, the 4f orbital occupancy increases, and the hybridization with conduction states enhances, signaling a crossover from partially localized to more itinerant 4f behavior. These features are in excellent agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that CMRT provides a parameter-free description and prediction of correlation-driven structural and electronic transitions in rare-earth compounds.

Notable phenomena include time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity and spontaneous vortex phases, which are driven by nontrivial interlayer interactions that remain debated. Using area-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence of such interaction by systematically probing the electronic structures of 1T- and 1H-terminted surfaces of 4Hb-TaS_2. The metallic states of subsurface 1H-layers are folded to the Brillouin zone center by the sqrt(13) by sqrt(13) modulation of the surface 1T-layer, forming chiral "windmill" Fermi surfaces via Umklapp scattering. These conducting states further hybridize with the incipient flat band of the surface 1T-layer, producing a Kondo-like peak at the Fermi level. Interlayer charge transfer induces distinct 3 by 3 and 2 by 2 charge orders on the surface and subsurface 1H-layers, respectively, which result in characteristic segmented Fermi surfaces and dichotomously shift the van Hove singularities. These findings reconcile the competing Kondo and Mott-Hubbard models in this material and emphasize the interplay of flat bands, van hove singularities, charge orders, and unconventional superconductivity in correlated superlattices.

Motivation: 研究稀土十二硼化物RB12及其固溶体的动态电导特性，特别关注磁性稀土离子对B12晶格Jahn-Teller动力学的影响，以及金属-绝缘体转变过程中的载流子行为变化。

Method: 在室温下对RB12（R=Ho、Er、Tm）和Tm1-xYbxB12固溶体进行40-35000 cm-1范围的动态电导光谱测量，分离和分析Drude型分量和过阻尼激发。

Result: 发现磁性RB12在200 cm-1以上存在额外吸收带，归因于B12复合物的协同Jahn-Teller动力学。非平衡电子在电荷传输中占主导，Drude型载流子比例变化20-40%。Tm1-xYbxB12固溶体中金属-绝缘体转变伴随Drude型电子浓度降低和载流子向局域化JT集体模式重新分布。

Conclusion: 稀土十二硼化物的电荷传输主要由参与集体Jahn-Teller模式形成的非平衡电子主导，金属-绝缘体转变过程中载流子从Drude型向局域化集体模式重新分布，Yb离子价态不稳定性导致局域化集体模式的形成。

Abstract: A thorough study of the wide-range (40-35000 cm-1) dynamic conductivity spectra of the rare-earth (RE) dodecaborides RB12 (R- Ho, Er and Tm) and Tm1-xYbxB12 substitutional solid solutions was carried out at room temperature. Both the Drude-type components and overdamped excitations have been separated and analyzed. An additional absorption band observed above 200 cm-1 in these RB12 with magnetic RE ions is attributed to the cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics of the B12 complexes, which depends crucially on the RE-ion cage space and is compared with the same effect found in the non-magnetic LuB12 and ZrB12. It was shown that non-equilibrium (hot) electrons participating in the formation of the collective JT modes dominate in charge transport, and portion of Drude-type carriers changes by 20-40% in these compounds with unstable boron lattice. Strong renormalization of the infrared response is observed in Tm1-xYbxB12 solid solutions with metal-insulator transition (MIT) and is discussed in terms of localized collective modes caused by Yb-ion valence instability. We demonstrate that even at room temperature the MIT is accompanied with simultaneous decrease in concentration of Drude-type electrons and redistribution of carriers to localized JT collective modes.

Method: 使用D-TRILEX方法自洽地考虑铁磁涨落，包括对电子自能的非局域贡献和电子相互作用顶点的正确处理。

Result: 在低温下观察到电子谱函数分裂，分裂带仅有一个穿过费米能级，费米面保持未分裂但面积增大，表明存在非费米液体电子激发。

Conclusion: D-TRILEX方法中自洽考虑非局域贡献和正确处理电子相互作用顶点对于获得这种电子行为至关重要，揭示了铁磁涨落对电子性质的复杂影响。

Abstract: We consider the electronic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on a square lattice with the ratio of the next-nearest-neighbor and nearest-neighbor hoppings $t'/t=-0.45$, which favours the ferromagnetic instability. We find, that a self-consistent consideration of the ferromagnetic fluctuations within the D-TRILEX approach results in the splitting of the electronic spectral function at low temperatures. This splitting exhibits only a weak momentum dependence, and only one of the split bands crosses the Fermi level. As a result, the Fermi surface itself remains unsplit, but its area increases, reflecting the presence of non-Fermi-liquid electronic excitations. We show that both the self-consistent account of the non-local contributions to the electronic self-energy and the proper treatment of electron interaction vertices in D-TRILEX are important to obtain this behaviour.

Motivation: 研究一维系统中热导率的反常行为，特别是理论预测的热导率发散与实际数值研究中观察到的有限热导率之间的矛盾。

Method: 通过数值研究分析多个一维系统模型，提出能量通量由正常传导和异常传导两部分组成的假设，并研究ding-a-ling模型的变体。

Result: 发现所有研究的模型在热力学极限下都表现出发散的热导率，尽管向异常传导主导的转变可能发生在极长的系统尺寸下。

Conclusion: 在热力学极限下，一维系统的热导率确实会发散，这与理论预测一致，但实际观测到的有限热导率可能是由于系统尺寸不够大导致的。

Abstract: Numerical studies of some unidimensional systems provide evidence of finite thermal conductivity, where theory predicts a divergence with the system size. Some models are here reviewed under the working hypothesis that the energy flux across a nonequilibrium stationary state may be the sum of two contributions: the former responsible for normal conductivity, the latter accounting for the anomalous component. I conclude that in the thermodynamic limit, the diverging component is indeed present, although the crossover to a regime dominated by the anomalous component may occur at extremely long system sizes.
  Finally, I study a variant of the ding-a-ling model, previously claimed to satisfy Fourier law, showing that it too exhibits a diverging conductivity in the thermodynamic limit.

Motivation: 现有机器学习势能面模型主要依赖ab initio计算数据，但可能无法准确再现实验观测的热力学和结构性质。需要开发能够同时利用计算和实验数据的混合训练方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效整合ab initio计算数据和实验观测数据，生成更准确的混合机器学习模型，提高对实验性质的再现能力。

Abstract: We propose a methodology to generate hybrid machine learning models for the potential energy surface trained simultaneously on data from ab initio electronic structure calculations and on thermodynamic and/or structural observables from experiment. The approach is based on the use of a loss function that includes the mean square error of observables with respect to their experimental values, in addition to the usual terms involving the mean square error of the energies and forces with respect to ab initio data. We employ a reweighting procedure that allows for the calculation of ensemble averages of observables during training for arbitrary values of the model parameters and on the fly. The method is general and can be applied to any set of static observables. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to the generation of hybrid models for liquid water that reproduce accurately the experimental density maximum, the density isobar at 1 bar, and the radial distribution function in molecular dynamics simulations.

Conclusion: 该方法成功推导了广义Lennard-Jones势能下量子修正的紧凑解析表达式，为研究量子流体热力学性质提供了有效工具，并可系统扩展到高阶修正。

Abstract: We derive an explicit analytic expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient of a $d$-dimensional fluid whose particles interact via the generalized Lennard-Jones $(2n,n)$ potential. By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed. Moreover, the same methodology can be systematically extended to obtain higher-order quantum corrections.

Abstract: We investigate heat conduction in a one-dimensional chain of rigid rotors. The rotors are constrained to rotate in a plane about fixed pivot points and coupled by springs, such that in equilibrium, the neighboring rotors lie on opposite sides of the chain axis. The linearized limit of this model valid for small angular displacements, was first introduced by Kane and Lubensky (KL) as a topological mechanical insulator hosting zero-energy vibrational edge modes. We show that the linearized KL chain behaves as a thermal insulator at low temperature in both the topological phases with a finite band gap, and the heat current falls exponentially with the chain length. When the gap vanishes at the topological phase transition, the KL chain becomes a good thermal conductor and conducts heat ballistically. The chain of rotors for arbitrary angular displacements hosts nonlinear solitary waves and distinct topological mechanical phases. Our numerical analysis shows normal (diffusive) heat conduction in all topological phases of the nonlinear chain. Nevertheless, a finite thermal conductivity is achieved for different system sizes in different topological phases of this nonlinear chain.

TL;DR: 研究一类随机重置过程，其中扩散粒子在自由运动和外部控制势阱约束之间交替。当粒子被重新捕获时，它会经历返回轨迹回到指定重置点。传统SR假设返回瞬时完成，但实际有有限持续时间并引入后续搜索起点的不精确性。

Motivation: 研究现实设置中随机重置过程的有限返回时间问题，解决传统瞬时返回假设与实际物理过程不符的问题，探索更高效的搜索策略。

Method: 使用波动谐波势阱，在粒子到达原点时强制终止返回轨迹，确保所有向外扩散轨迹从同一点开始。通过瞬时位置信息实现反馈控制，缩短返回阶段而不增加机械能量成本。

Result: 分析了基于这种受控返回机制的几种搜索协议，计算了它们的平均首次通过时间。特别关注一个完全消除向外扩散的协议，其中返回运动本身成为搜索机制。

Conclusion: "通过返回搜索"的视角颠覆了传统SR逻辑，得到了封闭形式的平均首次通过时间，突显了使用返回动力学作为主要搜索策略的效率。

Abstract: We study a class of stochastic resetting (SR) processes in which a diffusing particle alternates between free motion and confinement by an externally controlled potential. When the particle is recaptured, it undergoes a return trajectory that drives it toward a designated reset point. In standard SR, such returns are treated as instantaneous, but in realistic setups they have finite duration and introduce imprecision in the starting points of subsequent search attempts. We analyze a fluctuating harmonic potential in which return trajectories are forcibly terminated the moment the particle reaches the origin, ensuring that all outward (diffusive) trajectories begin from the same point. This is implemented through instantaneous positional information: a feedback signal that shortens the return phase without incurring additional mechanical energetic cost. We examine several search protocols built on this controlled return mechanism and determine their mean first-passage times (MFPTs). Of particular interest is a protocol in which outward diffusion is eliminated entirely and the return motion itself becomes the search mechanism. This "search by return" perspective reverses the conventional logic of SR and yields a closed-form MFPT that highlights the efficiency of using return dynamics as the primary search strategy.

Result: 证明了该系统存在精确的行波解。

Conclusion: 在特定动力学条件下，Eguchi-Oki-Matsumura系统可以支持精确的行波解，这为理解同时发生的相变过程提供了新的数学工具。

Abstract: To describe the simultaneous order-disorder transformation and phase separation Eguchi, Oki and Matsumura [\doi{10.1557/proc-21-589}] introduced the system of two equations: one equation, governing the evolution of a conserved order parameter, and the second equation for the non-conserved order parameter. The key feature of their model is the free energy functional, which contains the square gradient terms of the both order parameters and a fourth power polynomial depending on both order parameters. According to the general Hohenberg-Halperin classification it is the type C model. We show that if the dynamics of the conserved order parameter is governed by the convective-viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation, this system allows exact traveling wave solution.

Abstract: We investigate how the spectral and topological properties of electron systems evolve on a lattice that interpolates between the honeycomb and its 1/6-depleted structures through the introduction of selective random defects. We find that in certain parameter regimes, the topological properties of the two lattice systems are smoothly connected, whereas in other regimes, selective random defects induce a topological transition. Analysis based on an effective model reveals that the effect of selective random defects can be understood as a modulation of hopping amplitudes. Our results highlight the potential for designing and controlling the spectral and even topological properties of electronic systems across a wide range of material platforms.

Abstract: Charge transport in QD solids is typically understood as thermally activated tunneling or hopping between states that are localized on individual QDs. Here, we show that the slow relaxation that is associated with the disorder-broadened density of (localized) states leads to a strong electric field F dependence of the charge carrier mobility. We interpret the results in terms of an increased effective electronic temperature T_eff that exceeds that of the lattice. We use a heat balance model to derive an analytical expression for T_eff (F) that is similar to, and puts a physical basis under the phenomenological expression proposed by Marianer and Shklovskii [Phys. Rev. B 46, 13100 (1992)]. We apply this model to analyze the field- and temperature-dependent conductivity in ZnO QDs with varying ligand length and depletion shell thickness and find (effective) localization lengths ranging from 2 to 5 nm. Both experimental and analytical results compare favorably to numerical simulations by kinetic Monte Carlo. Due to the large value of the effective localization length, the field dependence already becomes relevant at modest fields around 1-10 V/micron, that are typical for operational conditions of photovoltaic and light emitting devices based on quantum dot solids.

Abstract: The oscillatory dynamics of natural and man-made systems can be disrupted by their time-varying interactions, leading to oscillation quenching phenomena in which the oscillations are suppressed. We introduce a framework for analyzing, assessing, and controlling oscillation quenching using coupling functions. Specifically, by observing limit-cycle oscillators we investigate the bifurcations and dynamical transitions induced by time-varying diffusive and periodic coupling functions. We studied the transitions between oscillation quenching states induced by the time-varying form of the coupling function while the coupling strength is kept invariant. The time-varying periodic coupling function allowed us to identify novel, non-trivial inhomogeneous states that have not been reported previously. Furthermore, by using dynamical Bayesian inference we have also developed a Proportional Integral (PI) controller that maintains the oscillations and \red{prevents oscillation quenching from occurring}. In addition to the present implementation and its generalizations, the framework carries broader implications for identification and control of oscillation quenching in a wide range of systems subjected to time-varying interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOTA方法将原始GPS轨迹转换为网格或道路轨迹时，会丢失细粒度的时空细节，因为多个GPS点被分组到单个网格单元或道路段中。

Method: 提出BLUrred Encoding方法，逐步降低GPS坐标精度创建分层补丁；使用具有金字塔结构的编码器-解码器模型，每个补丁级别使用Transformer学习嵌入，通过池化和上采样在不同级别间互补；采用轨迹重建任务和MSE损失进行训练。

Conclusion: BLUE通过分层补丁设计有效平衡了细粒度时空细节和高级旅行语义的捕获，在轨迹表示学习任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vector embeddings and facilitates tasks such as trajectory classification and similarity search. State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

Conclusion: 通过直接将提示与潜在方向关联，SCALEX使扩散模型中的偏见分析比先前方法更具可扩展性、可解释性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Image generation models frequently encode social biases, including stereotypes tied to gender, race, and profession. Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.
  We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.

Result: 实验表明，即使是微小且物理上合理的扰动也能显著破坏模型输出，揭示了基于LLM的预测器对对抗性操纵的敏感性。进一步分析揭示了准确性与鲁棒性之间的权衡关系，并探讨了失效机制和潜在缓解方案。

Conclusion: 这项研究首次揭示了LLM驱动的自动驾驶模型在车辆交互背景下的对抗脆弱性，强调了未来基于LLM的智能交通系统需要采用面向鲁棒性的设计方法。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.

Conclusion: RedReg方法能够有效调节多模态学习中的冗余信息，实现更平衡的优化过程

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to improve performance by leveraging data from multiple sources. During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Deep learning-based molecular generation models have shown great potential in efficiently exploring vast chemical spaces by generating potential drug candidates with desired properties. However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.

Motivation: 社交媒体冒犯内容检测需要高质量标注数据，但这类数据往往稀缺，因为冒犯实例出现频率低且人工标注成本高。

Method: 使用轻量级分类器在有限标注数据上训练，通过多智能体视觉语言模型（MA-VLMs）迭代为未标注实例分配伪标签。MA-VLMs模拟主持人和用户双重视角，采用新颖的PNU损失函数联合利用标注数据、一致未知集和分歧未知集，同时减轻伪标签噪声。

Conclusion: 该自训练框架能有效利用未标注数据，在低资源场景下提升冒犯内容检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate detection of offensive content on social media demands high-quality labeled data; however, such data is often scarce due to the low prevalence of offensive instances and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms baselines under limited supervision and approaches the performance of large-scale models

TL;DR: MoETTA是一个基于熵的测试时自适应框架，采用混合专家架构来处理混合分布偏移问题，通过解耦的专家模型实现多梯度方向的自适应，在真实世界部署场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署中经常遇到混合分布偏移，测试样本受到多样且可能冲突的域因素影响，现有TTA方法依赖统一的自适应路径，无法处理不同域间最优梯度方向的显著差异。

Method: 提出MoETTA框架，集成混合专家架构，引入结构解耦的专家集合，支持沿不同梯度方向进行自适应，实现灵活解耦的参数更新。

Result: 在三个混合分布偏移设置下的广泛实验表明，MoETTA始终优于强基线方法，建立了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过专家级多样性建模多个自适应方向具有显著优势，MoETTA能够更好地适应异构偏移，在真实部署条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Test-Time adaptation (TTA) has proven effective in mitigating performance drops under single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: token在许多研究领域中扮演重要角色且具有增长特性，但其增量学习研究相对匮乏，主要由于语言中token的整体性给增量学习框架设计带来挑战。

Method: 转向生物数据集中的基因token，建立基因增量学习流程和评估体系，并调整现有的类增量学习方法以缓解基因遗忘问题。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了框架设计和评估的合理性，以及方法调整的有效性。

Conclusion: 为单细胞转录组学中的基因增量学习提供了完整的基准测试。

Abstract: Classes, as fundamental elements of Computer Vision, have been extensively studied within incremental learning frameworks. In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.

Conclusion: 该方法能够自动生成可扩展的高性能微内核，减少对底层库的依赖，为ML从业者提供更易用的高性能计算解决方案。

Abstract: The rapidly evolving landscape of AI and machine learning workloads has widened the gap between high-level domain operations and efficient hardware utilization. Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.
  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PROF是一个利用大语言模型从自然语言描述和单条专家轨迹生成可执行奖励函数代码的框架，通过奖励偏好排序(RPR)策略评估奖励函数质量，无需环境交互或强化学习训练，在D4RL基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线模仿学习方法通常假设轨迹与专家演示的相似度与奖励正相关，这过度简化了奖励结构。需要更准确的方法来估计未标记数据集的奖励。

Method: 提出PROF框架：1) 使用LLM从自然语言描述和单条专家轨迹生成可执行奖励函数代码；2) 提出RPR策略评估奖励函数质量，计算支配分数；3) 通过RPR和基于文本的梯度优化交替进行奖励函数选择和优化。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，PROF在多个数据集和领域上超越或匹配了最近的强基线方法，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PROF通过自动化奖励函数生成和优化，为离线模仿学习提供了有效的解决方案，能够准确估计奖励并训练出高性能策略。

Abstract: Offline imitation learning (offline IL) enables training effective policies without requiring explicit reward annotations. Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 在分布外检测基准测试中，CED实现了优于或可比的不确定性估计，同时显著降低了推理开销。

Conclusion: CED框架有效解决了深度集成的计算成本问题，同时保持了良好的不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: Deep ensembles (DE) have emerged as a powerful approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty and distinguishing its aleatoric and epistemic components, thereby enhancing model robustness and reliability. However, their high computational and memory costs during inference pose significant challenges for wide practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we propose credal ensemble distillation (CED), a novel framework that compresses a DE into a single model, CREDIT, for classification tasks. Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification. Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks demonstrate that CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to several existing baselines, while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to DE.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法使用固定温度参数，这并非最优选择。此外，师生模型架构差异导致logit幅度不匹配，学生模型在训练早期需要更软的概率分布，后期则需要更尖锐的分布。

Method: 提出动态温度调度器(DTS)，根据师生模型交叉熵损失差距动态调整温度参数，这是首个基于师生分布差异自适应调整温度的调度方法，可与现有KD框架无缝集成。

Result: 在多个知识蒸馏策略和任务上验证了DTS的有效性，包括视觉任务(CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet)和NLP任务(GLUE、Dolly、SelfIns、UnNI、S-NI)，均一致优于静态温度基线方法。

Conclusion: 动态温度调度通过自适应调整温度参数，显著提升了知识蒸馏的性能，为知识蒸馏中的温度参数优化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) trains a smaller student model using a large, pre-trained teacher model, with temperature as a key hyperparameter controlling the softness of output probabilities. Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines.

Method: 从GloVe嵌入的共现矩阵出发，展示投影如何自然捕捉上下文影响，query-key-value机制作为建模方向关系的自然非对称扩展。

Result: 证明了位置编码和多头注意力都是同一投影原理的结构化改进，自注意力机制从语料级共现统计投影到序列上下文自然产生。

Conclusion: Transformer架构的特定代数形式遵循这些投影原理，而非任意设计选择，为理解自注意力提供了数学基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical interpretation of self-attention by connecting it to distributional semantics principles. We show that self-attention emerges from projecting corpus-level co-occurrence statistics into sequence context. Starting from the co-occurrence matrix underlying GloVe embeddings, we demonstrate how the projection naturally captures contextual influence, with the query-key-value mechanism arising as the natural asymmetric extension for modeling directional relationships. Positional encodings and multi-head attention then follow as structured refinements of this same projection principle. Our analysis demonstrates that the Transformer architecture's particular algebraic form follows from these projection principles rather than being an arbitrary design choice.

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法产生了与SHAP值和真实特征重要性一致的全局忠实、稳定的特征排序，同时保持高预测性能。特征评分速度比传统SHAP方法快150倍，仅需2秒训练时间，而SHAP需要300秒。在包含相关和无关特征的设置下，分类准确率分别提高了11.24%和29.33%。

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了模型准确性和可解释性之间的差距，为固有可解释的机器学习提供了一个可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Understanding the decision of large deep learning models is a critical challenge for building transparent and trustworthy systems. Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs. This work bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.

Result: 在数学和代码推理任务上的实验表明，DAS最多可减少50%的rollout时间，同时保持完全相同的训练曲线。

Conclusion: 分布感知的推测解码能够在不影响学习质量的情况下显著加速强化学习后训练过程。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning(RL) post-training has become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), yet its efficiency is increasingly constrained by the rollout phase, where long trajectories are generated token by token. We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-incremental learning (CIL), a core setting within continual learning where a model learns a sequence of tasks, each containing a distinct set of classes. Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates. Our experiments show that AnaCP not only outperforms existing baselines but also achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is regarded as the upper bound of CIL.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了随机森林中bootstrap rate(BR)对回归性能的影响，发现调整BR能显著提升模型性能，最佳BR设置与数据集特征相关：全局特征-目标关系强的数据集适合高BR，局部目标方差高的数据集适合低BR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机森林通常使用BR=1.0的默认设置，但缺乏对BR参数影响的系统研究，本文旨在探索不同BR值对随机森林回归性能的影响。

Method: 在39个异质回归数据集和16种RF配置上，系统地将BR从0.2变化到5.0，使用重复二折交叉验证和均方误差进行评估，并在合成数据集上进行控制噪声水平的实验。

Result: BR调优能显著改善性能：24个数据集最佳BR≤1.0，15个数据集最佳BR>1.0，仅4个数据集BR=1.0最优。高BR在低噪声场景减少模型偏差，低BR在高噪声场景减少模型方差。

Conclusion: BR是一个有影响力的超参数，应该通过调优来优化随机森林回归模型，其最佳设置与数据集特征密切相关。

Abstract: Random Forests (RFs) typically train each tree on a bootstrap sample of the same size as the training set, i.e., bootstrap rate (BR) equals 1.0. We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance. Overall, BR is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned to optimize RF regression models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个基于抽象语法树节点级不确定性估计的LLM生成SQL错误检测框架，通过语义感知标签算法和模式感知特征训练分类器，显著优于基于token概率的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成SQL的错误检测方法主要依赖token级别的概率估计，缺乏对SQL语义结构的深入理解，无法精确定位错误位置。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 语义感知标签算法为AST节点分配正确性标签；2) 使用模式感知和词汇特征训练监督分类器预测节点错误概率。

Result: 在多个数据库和数据集上，AUC平均提升27.44%，在跨数据库评估中保持鲁棒性，支持精确定位错误和针对性修复。

Conclusion: 基于节点的语义不确定性估计是序列级置信度测量的强有力且可解释的替代方案，支持目标修复和人机协同审查。

Abstract: We present a practical framework for detecting errors in LLM-generated SQL by estimating uncertainty at the level of individual nodes in the query's abstract syntax tree (AST). Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution. Together, these results establish node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence level confidence measures.

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要更好地理解鲁棒性认证方法的局限性，以改进认证系统的安全性。

Abstract: Certified defenses promise provable robustness guarantees. We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure. Our work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods.

*Marios Papamichals,Regina Ruane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了径向补偿(RC)方法，通过选择切空间中的基础密度，使似然仅依赖于从极点出发的测地距离，从而将参数语义与曲率解耦。RC让径向参数在测地单位中保持其通常含义，而图表可作为数值预处理器进行调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在曲面上生成模型时，指数映射保持测地线但具有刚性的、半径相关的雅可比矩阵，而体积保持图表保持密度但扭曲测地距离。这两种方法都将曲率与模型参数纠缠在一起，增加了梯度方差。在高维潜在归一化流中，包裹指数先验可以将半径拉伸到远超出曲率尺度，导致测试似然性差和刚性求解器。

Method: 引入径向补偿(RC)这一信息几何方法，选择切空间中的基础密度，使似然仅依赖于从极点出发的测地距离。扩展RC到已知测地极体积的流形，推导出平衡指数(bExp)图表族，平衡体积扭曲和测地误差。

Result: 在RC下，所有bExp设置保持相同的流形密度和Fisher信息，较小的拨号值减少梯度方差和流成本。经验上，RC在各种密度、VAE、图像和图的流以及蛋白质模型中产生稳定的生成模型。

Conclusion: RC提高了似然性，恢复了干净的测地半径，并防止了高维流中的半径爆炸，使RC-bExp成为流形上似然训练生成模型的稳健默认选择。

Abstract: Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.

Motivation: 传统运动分析系统昂贵且侵入性强，限制了在自然训练环境中的应用。需要一种非侵入式的方法来同时评估运动员的生物力学稳定性和心理韧性。

Method: 使用自研腕戴设备采集加速度和PPG信号，提出平滑差分加速度特征用于LSTM动作识别，提取HRV特征用于MLP压力分类。

Abstract: In precision sports such as archery, athletes' performance depends on both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.

TL;DR: CafeMed是一个用于药物推荐的框架，通过动态因果推理和跨模态注意力机制，解决了现有方法中医疗实体独立处理和静态因果关系的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物推荐系统存在两个基本限制：(i) 将医疗实体视为独立特征，未建模其对药物选择的协同效应；(ii) 使用静态因果关系，无法适应患者特定情境和健康状态。

Method: CafeMed包含两个关键组件：因果权重生成器(CWG)将静态因果效应转换为基于个体患者状态的动态调制权重；通道协调注意力精炼模块(CHARM)捕捉诊断和程序之间的复杂相互依赖关系。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上的广泛实验表明，CafeMed显著优于现有最先进基线，在药物预测准确性方面表现优异，同时保持较低的药物-药物相互作用率。

Conclusion: 整合动态因果关系和跨模态协同效应能够产生更符合临床实践和个性化的药物推荐。

Abstract: Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations.

TL;DR: 提出CFG-EC方法，通过修正无条件噪声预测来减少CFG在训练和采样过程中的不一致性，提高生成质量和提示对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG在训练时随机切换条件和空提示，但在采样时同时输出两者，导致训练和采样过程中的噪声估计不一致，需要减少这种误差。

Method: CFG-EC通过主动重新对齐无条件噪声误差分量，使其与条件误差分量正交，防止两个引导分量之间的干扰，从而约束采样误差的上界。

Result: 数值实验表明CFG-EC比CFG和CFG++更有效地处理无条件分量，在低引导采样机制下性能显著提升，并在所有情况下保持更高的提示对齐度。

Conclusion: CFG-EC是一种可增强任何基于CFG方法的通用校正方案，通过细化无条件噪声预测，为高保真图像生成建立更可靠的引导轨迹。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私审计方法需要修改训练数据集（如注入异常样本或移除样本），在大规模系统中资源密集且工程开销大，需要一种无需干预训练数据管道的审计方法。

Method: 引入基于数据分布固有随机性的观测性审计框架，将隐私审计扩展到保护属性和标签隐私，无需改变原始数据集。

Result: 在Criteo和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验证明该方法在审计标签隐私保证方面有效。

Conclusion: 这项工作为大规模生产环境中的实用隐私审计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.

Conclusion: MoE-SpeQ为在资源受限环境中管理数据依赖内存访问建立了一种新的原则性方法，使得MoE推理在商用硬件上更加可行。

Abstract: The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.
  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.

TL;DR: 本文主张在主观性机器学习任务中，标注分布本身应被视为真实标签，而非将其压缩为单一标签。通过软标签训练，模型能更好地保留认知不确定性，在保持准确性的同时更接近人类标注的分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准实践将多样的人类标注压缩为单一标签，这在模糊数据上存在认知偏差。模型被迫在本质上模糊的情况下表达虚假的置信度，造成模型确定性与人类感知多样性之间的错位。

Method: 采用软标签训练方法，将标注分布视为真实标签进行训练，而不是使用聚合后的单一硬标签。

Result: 在视觉和NLP任务中，软标签训练实现了32%更低的KL散度（相对于人类标注）和61%更强的模型与标注熵相关性，同时保持了与硬标签训练相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 标注分布不应被视为需要聚合的噪声信号，而应作为认知不确定性的忠实表示，模型应该学习重现这种不确定性。

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.

Conclusion: 该框架为使用观察性数据进行反事实生存推断提供了一个通用且可解释的工具，在医学、经济学和公共政策领域具有广泛应用价值。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data is particularly challenging due to censoring, limited sample sizes, and non-random treatment assignment. The need for answering such "when-if" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.

Conclusion: Fair-GNE通过自适应约束执行在多智能体学习型医疗系统中实现了统计显著的公平性提升，为大规模系统提供了清晰的公平执行框架。

Abstract: Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit explicit and implicit biases from their training datasets. Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is fundamentally challenged by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, necessitating probabilistic approaches to quantify uncertainty. While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25° spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models. We commit to making our code open-source upon acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: We simplify space binding by focusing on two core components, a single encoder per modality and high-quality data; enabling training state-of-the-art models on a single GPU in a few hours as opposed to multiple days. We present EBind, an Easy, data-centric, and parameter-efficient method to Bind the embedding spaces of multiple contrastive models. We demonstrate that a simple 1.8B-parameter image-text-video-audio-3D model can outperform models 4 to 17x the size. The key to achieving this is a carefully curated dataset of three complementary data sources: i) 6.7M fully-automated multimodal quintuples sourced via SOTA retrieval models, ii) 1M diverse, semi-automated triples annotated by humans as negative, partial, or positive matches, and iii) 3.4M pre-existing captioned data items. We use 13 different evaluations to demonstrate the value of each data source. Due to limitations with existing benchmarks, we further introduce the first high-quality, consensus-annotated zero-shot classification benchmark between audio and PCs. In contrast to related work, we will open-source our code, model weights, and datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了轨迹预测性能，还通过显式揭示每条预测轨迹背后的导航意图，增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Vessel trajectory prediction is fundamental to intelligent maritime systems. Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE. Furthermore, our method improves explainability by explicitly revealing the navigational intentions underlying each predicted trajectory.

TL;DR: 本文针对临床机器学习中的Rashomon效应（多个模型性能相当）提出两种互补工具：干预效率（IE）和扰动验证框架（PVF），用于在资源受限的临床环境中进行稳健的模型评估和选择。


<details>

Motivation: 临床机器学习面临多个性能相当的模型共存的问题，传统验证方案在小型、不平衡、噪声数据集和高维弱识别临床特征下不可靠，需要将预测性能与临床实用性联系起来。

Method: 提出干预效率（IE）作为容量感知指标，量化模型在有限干预可行时识别可操作真阳性的效率；提出扰动验证框架（PVF）评估模型在数据扰动下的稳定性。

Result: 在合成和真实医疗数据集上的实证结果表明，使用这些工具能够选择更稳健泛化且符合容量约束的模型。

Conclusion: IE和PVF为解决临床环境中的Rashomon效应提供了新方向，有助于选择在资源受限条件下表现更稳定的模型。

Abstract: In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

Conclusion: 该工作为等式约束统计学习问题提供了理论基础和实用算法，扩展了机器学习在复杂需求场景下的应用能力。

Abstract: As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.

Motivation: 联邦学习中的大模型适配面临安全威胁，特别是后门攻击，需要分析LoRA技术对这些攻击的影响。

Method: 通过实验分析LoRA不同秩对最先进后门攻击的影响，重点关注后门寿命这一关键特征。

Result: 实验发现，对于最优注入的后门，LoRA秩越低，后门在攻击后的持久性越长。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了FL中后门攻击评估的问题，有助于开发更稳健和公平的后门攻击评估方法，提高关键FL系统风险评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large models adaptation through Federated Learning (FL) addresses a wide range of use cases and is enabled by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.

Conclusion: REST方法能够有效应对跨模态检索中的查询偏移问题，实现在线和谐的自适应，保持公共空间结构和通用知识。

Abstract: Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.

Motivation: 解决ComplexEye等高通量成像平台产生指数级增长数据带来的存储和传输负担问题。

Method: 通过估计连续帧间的光流来提取可靠覆盖迁移细胞的感兴趣区域掩码，然后结合JPEG2000进行区域感知压缩。

Result: 在计算效率上达到与标准JPEG2000相当的运行时间，在现代笔记本电脑上实现约30帧/秒的吞吐量；在图像质量方面，在细胞区域获得更高的峰值信噪比，在相同PSNR下实现2.0-2.2倍更高的压缩率。

Conclusion: FlowRoI是一个高效的高通量图像压缩框架，特别适用于免疫细胞迁移研究，能显著减轻数据存储和传输负担。

Abstract: Autonomous migration is essential for the function of immune cells such as neutrophils and plays a pivotal role in diverse diseases. Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000.

Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在生成晶体材料时无法改变原子数量，这限制了模型采样轨迹的多样性。本文旨在解决这一限制，提高晶体材料生成的灵活性和质量。

Method: 提出了mirage infusion技术，允许扩散模型在生成过程中将原子状态从存在变为不存在（mirage）或反之。MiAD是一个等变联合扩散模型，专门用于从头晶体生成。

Result: 该技术使模型质量提高了2.5倍。MiAD在MP-20数据集上达到了8.2%的S.U.N.率，显著超过了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mirage infusion技术有效解决了扩散模型在晶体生成中的原子数量限制问题，MiAD模型在晶体材料发现方面表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring can play a key role in precision health. However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.

TL;DR: nnterp是一个轻量级包装器，为transformer分析提供统一接口，同时保留原始HuggingFace实现，解决了现有工具在一致性和准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有transformer分析工具面临基本权衡：自定义实现确保接口一致但需要手动适配每个架构且存在数值不匹配，而直接使用HuggingFace保持准确行为但缺乏标准化。需要桥接这一差距。

Method: 开发nnterp作为NNsight的轻量级包装器，通过自动模块重命名和全面验证测试，提供统一的transformer分析接口，同时保留原始HuggingFace实现。

Result: nnterp使研究人员能够编写一次干预代码并在50多个模型变体（涵盖16个架构家族）上部署，包含常见可解释性方法的内置实现，并提供对注意力概率的直接访问。

Conclusion: nnterp通过打包验证测试，桥接了机制可解释性工具中正确性和可用性之间的差距。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research requires reliable tools for analyzing transformer internals across diverse architectures. Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.

Motivation: 开发一个轻量级、易于训练的条件分布估计方法，能够进行高效的条件采样和统计估计，避免传统方法中的复杂要求。

Method: 学习随机映射φ(x,u)，使得φ(x,U)与Y|X=x的分布近似相同，通过KL散度目标函数训练，无需可逆性或对抗训练。

Result: 实验表明CPFN性能与最先进方法（包括核估计、树基算法和深度学习技术）相当甚至更优，同时保持轻量和易训练。

Conclusion: CPFN提供了一个高效、轻量且易于训练的条件分布估计框架，在保持竞争力的同时简化了训练过程。

Abstract: We introduce conditional push-forward neural networks (CPFN), a generative framework for conditional distribution estimation. Instead of directly modeling the conditional density $f_{Y|X}$, CPFN learns a stochastic map $\varphi=\varphi(x,u)$ such that $\varphi(x,U)$ and $Y|X=x$ follow approximately the same law, with $U$ a suitable random vector of pre-defined latent variables. This enables efficient conditional sampling and straightforward estimation of conditional statistics through Monte Carlo methods. The model is trained via an objective function derived from a Kullback-Leibler formulation, without requiring invertibility or adversarial training. We establish a near-asymptotic consistency result and demonstrate experimentally that CPFN can achieve performance competitive with, or even superior to, state-of-the-art methods, including kernel estimators, tree-based algorithms, and popular deep learning techniques, all while remaining lightweight and easy to train.

Motivation: 时间序列生成在分析决策任务中很重要，但局部扰动引起的时间异质性给生成结构一致的时间序列带来了挑战。传统流匹配方法使用全局共享参数，限制了速度场的表达能力，无法充分捕捉扰动时间序列中的突变转换。

Method: 提出了扰动感知流匹配框架PAFM，包含扰动引导训练来模拟局部扰动，利用双路径速度场捕捉扰动下的轨迹偏差，并通过带有流路由的专家混合解码器动态分配建模能力以适应不同的轨迹动态。

Result: 在无条件和有条件生成任务上的大量实验表明，PAFM始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: PAFM通过扰动感知的建模方法，能够生成稳定且结构一致的时间序列，有效解决了扰动时间序列生成中的挑战。

Abstract: Time series generation is critical for a wide range of applications, which greatly supports downstream analytical and decision-making tasks. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{PAFM}, a \textbf{P}erturbation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界表格数据通常包含异构特征（数值、分类和离散属性共存），现有基于扩散的填补模型假设同质特征空间，难以保持条件一致性，容易导致分类变量信息崩溃或数值变量更新不稳定。单一扩散过程不足以处理混合类型表格填补。

Conclusion: 结果表明，结构感知的扩散过程对于推进深度学习在表格数据填补中的应用具有重要意义，分离处理异构特征的方法优于单一扩散过程。

Abstract: Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.
  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.
  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.

Abstract: These notes provide a self-contained introduction to kernel methods and their geometric foundations in machine learning. Starting from the construction of Hilbert spaces, we develop the theory of positive definite kernels, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), and Hilbert-Schmidt operators, emphasizing their role in statistical estimation and representation of probability measures. Classical concepts such as covariance, regression, and information measures are revisited through the lens of Hilbert space geometry. We also introduce kernel density estimation, kernel embeddings of distributions, and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The exposition is designed to serve as a foundation for more advanced topics, including Gaussian processes, kernel Bayesian inference, and functional analytic approaches to modern machine learning.

Motivation: 解决智能体从经验中学习并在多样化任务中泛化而无需任务特定训练的基本挑战，探索互补学习机制的协同整合潜力。

Method: 结合三种机制：(1)基于LLM的分层TODO分解进行战略规划，(2)历史感知因果反思分析最近行动模式识别失败根源，(3)基于梯度的优化进行系统性改进。

Result: 在ALFWorld基准任务上实现67%的零样本成功率，无需任何先验任务经验或演示，跨任务转移性能提升67%到78%。

Conclusion: 互补学习机制的协同整合能够实现稳健的零样本泛化，接近先前工作的少样本基线性能。

Abstract: Enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and decision-making. While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.

Abstract: Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.

TL;DR: CLO是一个通过算法-系统协同设计的CPU轻量级KVCache卸载系统，解决了现有系统在CPU瓶颈方面的三个问题：细粒度动态缓存管理开销、PCIe带宽利用率低以及GPU运行时气泡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着百万token LLM的发展，推理系统的可扩展性面临KVCache内存使用和数据传输开销的挑战。现有卸载系统虽然将KVCache迁移到CPU内存并采用top-k注意力，但忽视了CPU瓶颈问题。

Method: CLO采用算法-系统协同设计，包括：粗粒度的头部近似GPU缓存策略、数据预取与GPU持久缓存的结合、零拷贝传输引擎以及GPU中心同步方法。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的LLM上评估表明，CLO在保持与最先进系统相当精度的同时，显著减少CPU开销，充分利用PCIe带宽，解码吞吐量提升9.3%-66.6%。

Conclusion: 算法-系统协同设计对于现代GPU平台上内存受限的LLM推理至关重要。CLO已开源。

Abstract: The growth of million-token LLMs exposes the scalability limits of inference systems, where the KVCache dominates memory usage and data transfer overhead. Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. We open source CLO at https://github.com/CommediaJW/CLO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 现代大型语言模型在遵循简单概率分布输出方面严重失败，表现出接近阶跃函数的行为，几乎只生成概率略高的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学创意生成和选择需要遵循目标概率分布进行探索，而当前AI基准测试有客观正确答案，通过强化学习训练LLM会抑制概率探索。

Method: 进行系统实验，要求LLM按照简单概率分布生成输出，测试其遵循分布的能力。

Result: 所有测试的现代LLM都严重无法遵循分布，例如要求49%时间输出"1"时，几乎100%输出"0"，这种阶跃函数行为甚至压制了LLM的强内在偏见。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在概率探索方面存在严重缺陷，无法有效遵循目标概率分布进行输出。

Abstract: Scientific idea generation and selection requires exploration following a target probability distribution. In contrast, current AI benchmarks have objectively correct answers, and training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning against these benchmarks discourages probabilistic exploration. Here, we conducted systematic experiments requesting LLMs to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions, and found that all modern LLMs tested grossly fail to follow the distributions. For example, requesting a binary output of "1" 49% of the time produces an answer of "0" nearly 100% of the time. This step function-like behavior of near-exclusively generating the output with marginally highest probability even overrules even strong in-built LLM biases.

Conclusion: Adapformer通过有效的通道管理策略，成功解决了多变量时间序列预测中的依赖关系建模问题，在保持高预测精度的同时提升了计算效率，成为该领域的先进解决方案。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.

Motivation: 现有的投影质量度量主要关注数据全局或局部结构的保持，但忽略了视觉失真问题，特别是异常值或伪影可能误导视觉分析。

Method: 基于点间空白区域正确保持对视觉表示保真度至关重要的假设，开发了Warping Index度量方法。

Result: 提出了Warping Index这一新的度量指标，能够更好地评估降维投影的视觉质量。

Conclusion: Warping Index为降维投影质量评估提供了新的视角，特别关注视觉表示的保真度，有助于避免误导性的视觉分析结论。

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used for the visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data due to their ability to project datasets of high-dimensional points onto the 2D plane. However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising method for editing pre-trained \textit{open-vocabulary} models, offering a cost-effective alternative to standard multi-task fine-tuning. However, despite the abundance of \textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition. Overall, our findings expand the applicability of task arithmetic to a broader class of pre-trained models and open the way for more efficient use of pre-trained models in diverse settings.

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能够有效识别吸烟相关健康风险，关键生物标志物为临床筛查提供了可解释的预测依据，有助于早期干预和预防。

Abstract: Smoking continues to be a major preventable cause of death worldwide, affecting millions through damage to the heart, metabolism, liver, and kidneys. However, current medical screening methods often miss the early warning signs of smoking-related health problems, leading to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options become limited. This study presents a systematic comparative evaluation of machine learning approaches for smoking-related health risk assessment, emphasizing clinical interpretability and practical deployment over algorithmic innovation. We analyzed health screening data from 55,691 individuals, examining various health indicators, including body measurements, blood tests, and demographic information. We tested three advanced prediction algorithms - Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM - to determine which could most accurately identify people at high risk. This study employed a cross-sectional design to classify current smoking status based on health screening biomarkers, not to predict future disease development. Our Random Forest model performed best, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.926, meaning it could reliably distinguish between high-risk and lower-risk individuals. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to understand what the model was detecting, we found that key health markers played crucial roles in prediction: blood pressure levels, triglyceride concentrations, liver enzyme readings, and kidney function indicators (serum creatinine) were the strongest signals of declining health in smokers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdamW等自适应优化器中嵌入的ℓ₂惩罚的二次性质使得所有参数以相同速率向原点衰减，容易受到极端梯度方向的影响，并经常过度惩罚条件良好的坐标。

Method: 提出AdamHuberDecay，用解耦的平滑Huber正则化器替代ℓ₂惩罚，推导出闭式解耦Huber衰减步骤，以O(1)额外成本与任何Adam系列优化器集成。

Conclusion: AdamHuberDecay为下一代基础生成变换器的训练提供了一种简单、有原则的路径，实现更高效和更具弹性的训练。

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers with decoupled weight decay, such as AdamW, are the de facto standard for pre-training large transformer-based generative models. Yet the quadratic nature of the $\ell_2$ penalty embedded in weight decay drives all parameters toward the origin at the same rate, making the update vulnerable to rare but extreme gradient directions and often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordinates. We propose AdamHuberDecay, a drop-in replacement for AdamW that substitutes the $\ell_2$ penalty with a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer. The resulting update decays parameters quadratically while their magnitude remains below a threshold $δ$, and linearly ($\ell_1$-like) once they exceed $δ$, yielding (i) bounded regularization gradients, (ii) invariance to per-coordinate second-moment rescaling, and (iii) stronger sparsity pressure on overgrown weights.
  We derive the closed-form decoupled Huber decay step and show how to integrate it with any Adam-family optimizer at $O(1)$ extra cost. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and GPT-3 pre-training demonstrate that AdamHuberDecay (a) converges 10-15% faster in wall-clock time, (b) reduces validation perplexity by up to 4 points, (c) delivers performance improvements of 2.5-4.7% across downstream tasks, and (d) yields visibly sparser weight histograms that translate into 20-30% memory savings after magnitude pruning, without tuning the decay coefficient beyond the default grid used for AdamW. Ablations confirm robustness to outlier gradients and large-batch regimes, together with theoretical analyses that bound the expected parameter norm under noisy updates. AdamHuberDecay therefore provides a simple, principled path toward more efficient and resilient training of next-generation foundational generative transformers.

Result: 实验结果显示，基于LAUD的大语言模型在商品名称分类任务中优于零样本或少样本学习的大语言模型。

Conclusion: LAUD框架在缺乏标注数据的场景下有效提升模型性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to generalize beyond their pre-training data, and fine-tuning LLMs can elevate performance to human-level and beyond. However, in real-world scenarios, lacking labeled data often prevents practitioners from obtaining well-performing models, thereby forcing practitioners to highly rely on prompt-based approaches that are often tedious, inefficient, and driven by trial and error. To alleviate this issue of lacking labeled data, we present a learning framework integrating LLMs with active learning for unlabeled dataset (LAUD). LAUD mitigates the cold-start problem by constructing an initial label set with zero-shot learning. Experimental results show that LLMs derived from LAUD outperform LLMs with zero-shot or few-shot learning on commodity name classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of LAUD.

Motivation: 传统评分聚合方法（如样本均值）无法适应随时间变化的质量变化，且忽略了评论异质性（如评论情感、有用性），导致评分聚合不够准确。

Method: 开发了一种定制化的高斯过程模型，该模型能够捕捉评分随时间变化的动态特性，同时考虑评论异质性因素。

Conclusion: 高斯过程模型为在线声誉系统提供了更准确和自适应的评分聚合方法，能够更好地反映预期客户满意度，对营销从业者和客户具有重要价值。

Abstract: Online ratings influence customer decision-making, yet standard aggregation methods, such as the sample mean, fail to adapt to quality changes over time and ignore review heterogeneity (e.g., review sentiment, a review's helpfulness). To address these challenges, we demonstrate the value of using the Gaussian process (GP) framework for rating aggregation. Specifically, we present a tailored GP model that captures the dynamics of ratings over time while additionally accounting for review heterogeneity. Based on 121,123 ratings from Yelp, we compare the predictive power of different rating aggregation methods in predicting future ratings, thereby finding that the GP model is considerably more accurate and reduces the mean absolute error by 10.2% compared to the sample mean. Our findings have important implications for marketing practitioners and customers. By moving beyond means, designers of online reputation systems can display more informative and adaptive aggregated rating scores that are accurate signals of expected customer satisfaction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习平台的优化标准往往反映设计者而非用户的优先事项，导致用户采取战略行为来获取更有利的结果。过去研究主要关注对已部署模型的战略响应，而忽略了用户行为的相互影响。

Method: 首先形式化level-k思维概念，用户通过向前看一步来超越同伴；然后研究集体推理，用户通过协调行动来优化对模型的共同影响；对比自私行为与集体行为，分析协调的收益与限制。

Result: 研究发现：level-k思维加速了均衡收敛，但长期来看更高层次的推理对个体没有益处；集体推理揭示了学习者效用与用户效用之间对齐的新概念。

Conclusion: 用户战略行为与平台预测之间存在复杂的相互作用，集体协调能够带来收益，学习者与用户效用之间的对齐成为关键概念。该研究连接了战略分类、执行性预测和算法集体行动等多个数学框架。

Abstract: On many learning platforms, the optimization criteria guiding model training reflect the priorities of the designer rather than those of the individuals they affect. Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-$k$ thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept. We discuss connections to several related mathematical frameworks, including strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) has a wide range of applications in various complex physical systems (CPS), i.e., transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. Among all the proposed methods, the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) has proved to be generalizable and extendable in different applications and has multiple variants achieving state-of-the-art performance in various STDM applications. However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model. In addition, we explore and approximate the Pareto front between model performance and computational efficiency by designing a multi-objective composite loss function, which provides a practical guide for practitioners to adjust the model according to computational resource constraints and the performance requirements of downstream tasks.

Abstract: We study how vision-language-action (VLA) models can improve through real-world deployments via reinforcement learning (RL). We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $π^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate.

Abstract: Understanding how systems evolve over time often requires discovering the differential equations that govern their behavior. Automatically learning these equations from experimental data is challenging when the data are noisy or limited, and existing approaches struggle, in particular, with the estimation of unobserved derivatives. Here, we introduce an integral Bayesian symbolic regression method that learns governing equations directly from raw time-series data, without requiring manual assumptions or error-prone derivative estimation. By sampling the space of symbolic differential equations and evaluating them via numerical integration, our method robustly identifies governing equations even from noisy or scarce data. We show that this approach accurately recovers ground-truth models in synthetic benchmarks, and that it makes quasi-optimal predictions of system dynamics for all noise regimes. Applying this method to bacterial growth experiments across multiple species and substrates, we discover novel growth equations that outperform classical models in accurately capturing all phases of microbial proliferation, including lag, exponential, and saturation. Unlike standard approaches, our method reveals subtle shifts in growth dynamics, such as double ramp-ups or non-canonical transitions, offering a deeper, data-driven understanding of microbial physiology.

Conclusion: LD脊线与OFM边界近乎完美对齐，揭示了控制输运的瓣动力学和流形结构，证明了OFM框架在分析复杂相空间输运中的有效性。

Abstract: We investigate phase space transport in a two-dimensional stretched caldera potential using the Origin-Fate Map (OFM) framework, complemented by Lagrangian Descriptor (LD) analysis. The caldera potential, a model for reaction dynamics with multiple exit channels, is adjusted by a stretching factor lambda that controls the directional bias of the four-saddle landscape. Several OFMs are constructed for two Poincare surfaces of section using forwards and backwards symplectic integration to assign each initial condition a channel of origin and fate. Our results reproduce the highly symmetric lambda = 1.0 patterns reported in Hillebrand et al. (Phys. Rev. E 108, 024211, 2023), and reveal, for smaller lambda, pronounced channel imbalance, figure-eight transport loops, and complex mixed-channel chaotic regions. Long-time integrations show a reduction of trapped regions with boundaries that exhibit self-similarity under deep zoom, revealing fractal-like structures. High-resolution OFMs and LD gradient maps uncover lobe dynamics and manifold structures that govern transport, showing near-perfect alignment between LD ridges and OFM boundaries.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合量子反馈控制方法，通过引入辅助量子比特和轻量级预测器来显著延长量子比特寿命，超越传统Wiseman-Milburn反馈的性能极限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幅度阻尼从根本上限制了量子比特寿命，传统Wiseman-Milburn反馈仅作用于单个测量正交分量且受环路延迟影响，改进有限。需要一种能够从两个场正交分量恢复信息并克服硬件延迟的方法。

Method: 采用混合升级方案：(1) 耦合辅助量子比特实现量子相干反馈，从两个场正交分量恢复信息；(2) 轻量级监督预测器预测近未来零差电流，相位对齐校正以克服硬件延迟。

Result: 使用IBM规模参数（基线T1=50μs），数值模拟显示寿命延长3-4倍，同时提高了布居数保持和积分能量。Lindblad处理得到闭式有效衰减率。

Conclusion: 该方法模块化且与硬件兼容，辅助耦合和监督预测可添加到现有W-M环路中，将泄漏信息转换为精确的时间提前校正驱动。

Abstract: Amplitude damping fundamentally limits qubit lifetimes by irreversibly leaking energy and information into the environment. Standard Wiseman--Milburn feedback offers only modest improvement because it acts on a single measured quadrature and its corrective drive is degraded by loop delay. We introduce a compact hybrid upgrade with two components: (i) a coherently coupled \emph{ancilla} qubit that receives the homodyne current and feeds back \emph{quantum-coherently} on the system, recovering information from \emph{both} field quadratures and intentionally engineered to decay much faster than the system; and (ii) a lightweight supervised predictor that forecasts the near-future homodyne current, phase-aligning the correction to overcome hardware latency. A Lindblad treatment yields closed-form effective decay rates: the ancilla suppresses the emission channel by a cooperativity factor, while the predictor further suppresses the residual decay in proportion to forecast quality. Using IBM-scale parameters (baseline \(T_1 = 50~μ\mathrm{s}\)), numerical simulations surpass the W--M limit, achieving \(\sim 3\!-\!4\times\) longer \(T_1\) together with improved population retention and integrated energy. The method is modular and hardware-compatible: ancilla coupling and supervised prediction can be added to existing W--M loops to convert leaked information into a precise, time-advanced corrective drive. We also include a detailed, student-friendly derivation of the effective rates for both ancilla-assisted and prediction-enhanced feedback, making the impact of each design element analytically transparent.

Abstract: We present a method to detect entanglement partitions of multipartite quantum systems, by exploiting their inherent symmetries. Structures like genuinely multipartite entanglement, $m$-separability and entanglement depth are detected as very special cases. This formulation enables us to characterize all the entanglement partitions of all three- and four- partite states and witnesses with unitary and permutation symmetry. In particular, we find and parametrize a complete set of bound entangled states therein. For larger systems, we provide a large family of analytical witnesses detecting many-body states of arbitrary size where none of the parties is separable from the rest. This method relies on weak Schur sampling with projective measurements, and thus can be implemented in a quantum computer. Beyond physics, our results extend to the mathematical literature: we establish new inequalities between matrix immanants, and characterize the set of such inequalities for matrices of size three and four.

TL;DR: 提出了一种单淬灭协议，通过最小控制生成酉k设计。系统先在随机哈密顿量H1下演化，在Thouless时间后切换到独立抽取的H2继续演化，仅需一次控制操作即可接近酉k设计。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要连续随机化耦合或频繁淬灭操作，控制复杂。本协议旨在用最小控制实现酉k设计，同时提供Thouless时间的操作定义和混沌性定量诊断。

Method: 系统首先在随机哈密顿量H1下演化至Thouless时间ts，然后淬灭到独立抽取的H2继续演化。单次淬灭打破残余谱关联，使系统形成高阶设计。

Result: 该协议仅需一次控制操作即可生成接近酉k设计的演化，远优于需要连续随机化或频繁淬灭的传统方法。

Conclusion: 单淬灭协议为实现Haar类随机性提供了直接途径，具有操作简单、测量友好等优势，可应用于随机测量、基准测试和层析成像等领域。

Abstract: We present a single-quench protocol that generates unitary $k$-designs with minimal control. A system first evolves under a random Hamiltonian $H_1$; at a switch time $t_s \geq t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ (the Thouless time), it is quenched to an independently drawn $H_2$ from the same ensemble and then evolves under $H_2$. This single quench breaks residual spectral correlations that prevent strictly time-independent chaotic dynamics from forming higher-order designs. The resulting ensemble approaches a unitary $k$-design using only a single control operation -- far simpler than Brownian schemes with continuously randomized couplings or protocols that apply random quenches at short time intervals. Beyond offering a direct route to Haar-like randomness, the protocol yields an operational, measurement-friendly definition of $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ and provides a quantitative diagnostic of chaoticity. It further enables symmetry-resolved and open-system extensions, circuit-level single-quench analogs, and immediate applications to randomized measurements, benchmarking, and tomography.

Conclusion: 框架识别了最优机制，指定了最大化非稳定性生成的哈密顿量和临界温度。

Abstract: Nonstabiliserness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, capturing how much a quantum state breaks the symmetries that would make it classically simulable. Can nonstabiliserness be generated from stabiliser states simply by coupling them to a heat bath? We explore the thermodynamic limits of nonstabiliserness under minimal assumptions and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for when such a process can create it from an initial stabiliser state. This provides an analytic characterisation of the nonstabiliser states that are reachable in this way, together with quantitative bounds on their degree of nonstabiliserness. Our framework also identifies optimal regimes, specifying Hamiltonians that maximise nonstabiliserness generation and the critical temperatures at which it emerges.

Abstract: Quantum generative learning is a promising application of quantum computers, but faces several trainability challenges, including the difficulty in experimental gradient estimations. For certain structured quantum generative models, however, expectation values of local observables can be efficiently computed on a classical computer, enabling fully classical training without quantum gradient evaluations. Although training is classically efficient, sampling from these circuits is still believed to be classically hard, so inference must be carried out on a quantum device, potentially yielding a computational advantage. In this work, we introduce Fermionic Born Machines as an example of such classically trainable quantum generative models. The model employs parameterized magic states and fermionic linear optical (FLO) transformations with learnable parameters. The training exploits a decomposition of the magic states into Gaussian operators, which permits efficient estimation of expectation values. Furthermore, the specific structure of the ansatz induces a loss landscape that exhibits favorable characteristics for optimization. The FLO circuits can be implemented, via fermion-to-qubit mappings, on qubit architectures to sample from the learned distribution during inference. Numerical experiments on systems up to 160 qubits demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and training framework.

Result: 将受控Trotter演化所需的任意旋转门数量减少到与非受控Trotter演化相同，相比标准方法减少一半。

Conclusion: 该构造降低了容错量子模拟的成本，因为任意旋转门在容错架构中主导T成本。

Abstract: Quantum simulation is a promising application for quantum computing. Quantum simulation algorithms may require the ability to control the time evolution unitary. Naive techniques to control a unitary can substantially increase the required computational resources. A standard approach to controlling Trotterized time evolution doubles the number of single-qubit arbitrary rotations. Here, we describe a compilation scheme that does not increase the number of arbitrary rotations for symmetric Trotterizations, which applies to second-order and higher Suzuki-Trotter decompositions. This halves the number of arbitrary rotations required to implement controlled, Trotterized time evolution compared to the standard approach. Arbitrary rotations contribute significantly to resource estimates in a fault-tolerant architecture due to the number of required magic states. Therefore, arbitrary rotations dominate the $T$-cost of fault-tolerant implementations of quantum simulation. This construction reduces the number of arbitrary rotations for controlled Trotter evolution to that of uncontrolled Trotter evolution, thereby reducing the cost of fault-tolerant quantum simulation.

Abstract: This study examines the quantitative relationship between linguistic regularities and computational search complexity through a hybrid classical-quantum framework applied to Renaissance Italian texts. Using four representative works from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries-Il Principe (Machiavelli), Il Cortegiano (Castiglione), I Ricordi (Guicciardini), and Orlando Furioso (Ariosto)-we construct character-based n-gram models under both a historically grounded 25-letter orthography and the full modern Italian alphabet. These models provide corpus-derived probabilistic baselines for evaluating substitution-cipher search processes. Combining classical hill climbing and simulated annealing with Grover-style quantum-inspired estimates and a QUBO annealing formulation, we quantify how the probability that a key produces a linguistically plausible decryption (pgood) relates to expected computational effort. Across cipher lengths from 200 to 1000 characters, empirical results confirm the predicted dependence of Grover oracle calls on 1/sqrt(pgood) and show that longer texts yield sharper score distributions and smaller feasible key regions. Overall, the findings establish a link between linguistic redundancy and search-space contraction, providing an empirical framework for comparing classical, quantum-inspired, and idealized quantum search dynamics under unified corpus-driven constraints.

Conclusion: CETE算法通过减少电路深度，显著提高了在近端量子设备上进行量子多体动力学模拟的可访问时间，为强关联系统的模拟提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: We introduce the correlation-efficient time-evolution (CETE) algorithm for simulating quantum many-body dynamics. CETE recasts each step of time evolution as a time-independent correlation problem: the ansatz begins from a mean-field single Slater determinant and is then correlated to capture the true time-evolved state. We derive this exact ansatz from a contraction of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation onto the space of two electrons. Unlike conventional evolution by sequential short-time propagators, which must both correlate and decorrelate the state as the degree of correlation fluctuates in time, CETE correlates only once. This substantially reduces circuit depth, extending accessible simulation times on near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate the approach by simulating the time evolution of the hydrogen molecule's electronic wavefunction, highlighting the potential for the CETE algorithm to simulate strongly correlated systems on near-term devices.

Conclusion: 高精度多体基态可以直接从随机行列式发现，TrimCI为量子多体系统提供了一个无需先验知识、准确且高效的框架，其产生的紧凑显式波函数便于直接快速计算可观测量。

Abstract: Accurate quantum many-body calculations often depend on reliable reference states or good human-designed ansätze, yet these sources of knowledge can become unreliable in hard problems like strongly correlated systems. We introduce the Trimmed Configuration Interaction (TrimCI) method, a prior-knowledge-free algorithm that builds accurate ground states directly from random Slater determinants. TrimCI iteratively expands the variational space and trims away unimportant states, allowing a random initial core to self-refine into an accurate approximation of exact ground state. Across challenging benchmarks, TrimCI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with strikingly efficiency gains of several orders of magnitude. For [4Fe-4S] cluster, it matches recent quantum computing results with $10^6$-fold fewer determinants and CPU-hours. For the nitrogenase P-cluster, it matches selected-CI accuracy using $10^5$-fold fewer determinants. For $8\times8$ Hubbard model, it recovers over $99\%$ of the ground-state energy using only $10^{-28}$ of the Hilbert space. In some regimes, TrimCI attains orders-of-magnitude higher accuracy than AFQMC method. These results demonstrate that high-accuracy many-body ground states can be discovered directly from random determinants, establishing TrimCI as a prior-knowledge-free, accurate and highly efficient framework for quantum many-body systems. The compact explicit wavefunctions it produces further enable direct and rapid evaluation of observables.

Abstract: Postselection is a non-deterministic mechanism to entangle subsystems, often used in weakly-excited systems. We here show how highly-excited ensembles of two-level emitters can be entangled by photon detection. A collective spin is formed, characterized by a squeezing parameter detected by far-field measurements. While decoherence is detrimental to this conditional entanglement, successive photon detections act as a purification process and restores the spin squeezing. Our work opens up new avenues for the generation of postselected entanglement in open quantum systems.

Abstract: The present study systematically investigates the modulation mechanism of post-selected weak measurement (WM) on the non-classical properties of entangled coherent states (ECSs). The primary goal is achieving controllable enhancement of quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezing, while minimising disturbance to the quantum state. We theoretically analyze the post-selected weak measurement process, and its effectiveness in amplifying the non-classical features of ECSs. The von Neumann measurement model is employed to analytically describe the weak-value amplification of the pointer state. It is demonstrated that a significant enhancement of squeezing can be achieved by tuning the measurement coupling strength. The joint Wigner function analysis in phase space further reveals that, as the coupling strength increases, the coherent structure of the state evolves from symmetric double peaks to multi-branch quantum interference fringes. The entanglement, quantified by the Hillery-Zubairy criterion, exhibits a pronounced increase with stronger coupling, while the quantum Fisher information indicates a systematic improvement in phase estimation precision. The results obtained establish a tunable weak measurement framework for precise manipulation of continuous-variable entangled states. This provides a feasible theoretical pathway for enhancing quantum metrology and measurement-based state engineering.

Abstract: We formulate a canonical quantization of Equilibrium Thermodynamics by applying Dirac's theory of constrained systems. Thermodynamic variables are treated as conjugate pairs of coordinates and momenta, allowing extensive and intensive quantities to be promoted to operators in a Hilbert space. The formalism is applied to the ideal gas, the van der Waals gas, and the photon gas, illustrating both first- and second-class quantization procedures. For the ideal gas, a Schrödinger-like equation emerges in which entropy plays the role of time, and the wave function acquires a phase determined by the internal energy. A pseudo-Hermitian framework restores Hermiticity of the temperature operator and establishes the equivalence among constraint realizations. The approach naturally leads to thermodynamic uncertainty relations and suggests extensions to quantum and topological phase transitions, as well as black-hole and non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

Abstract: Entropic uncertainty relations quantify the limits on the predictability of quantum measurements. When the measured system is correlated with a quantum memory, these limits are described by the memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation (MA-EUR). We examine the behavior of MA-EUR when the memory qubit undergoes noisy dynamics implemented via high-order controlled processes, namely, the quantum switch and the quantum time-flip. We consider a setting in which the control qubit is the very system on which the measurements are performed, while the target qubit serves as a noisy quantum memory. Focusing on Pauli channels, we show that feeding them into the quantum switch and the quantum time-flip can significantly reduce the total entropic uncertainty as compared to their direct application. Our results reveal that indefinite causal order and input-output direction can serve as resources to mitigate the effects of noise in the context of MA-EUR and its applications.

Abstract: We look into the task of differentiating between any two quantum channels and reconstructing them from the obtained measurement statistics with possibly limited information about the experimental set-up. We employ the communication matrix formalism where the measurement statistics of a prepare-and-measure scenario is represented as a stochastic communication matrix. In order to differentiate between any two quantum channels, the informational completeness of the set-up is both necessary and sufficient. On the other hand, if we want to uniquely characterize any quantum channel, in addition we also need to have a complete description of the set-up. We show that in many important cases we can deduce this information directly from the communication matrix of the set-up before applying the channel. Given that we trust the dimension of the system, we show that we can deduce the information completeness of the set-up directly from the rank of the communication matrix. Furthermore, we show that another quantity of the communication matrix, called the information storability, can be used to self-test the set-up (up to unitary or antiunitary freedom) for an important class of states and measurements. This provides us a semi-device-independent way to identify quantum channels from the prepare-and-measure statistics. Lastly, we consider scenarios where we might have some additional information about the channels or additional resources at our disposal which could help us relax some of the assumptions of the proposed scenario.

Abstract: As quantum computers continue to improve and support larger, more complex computations, smart control hardware and compilers are needed to efficiently leverage the capabilities of these systems.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the execution of quantum algorithms on distributed quantum systems. The proposed method involves the development of a hardware design that supports parallel instruction execution and a compiler that modifies the order of instructions to increase parallelism opportunities. The hardware design can be flexibly configured to facilitate parallel execution of instructions that have identical parameters. Furthermore, the compiler uses the underlying hardware constraints to intelligently reorder and decompose instructions to avoid dependencies.
  The compiler, hardware, and their combination are evaluated using a runtime calculator and a benchmark quantum algorithm set. The results demonstrate a significant speedup, achieving a maximum average speedup of 16.5x and a maximum single-benchmark speedup of 56.2x relative to a baseline, serial execution model. Furthermore, we show a speedup can be obtained across all benchmarks using any of the proposed hardware schemes, although the degree of speedup is largely dependent on the type of quantum algorithm. Taken together, the results of this paper represent a significant step towards realizing high-performance quantum computing systems.

Abstract: Advances in quantum algorithms as well as in control hardware designs are continuously being made. These quantum algorithms, expressed as quantum circuits, need to be translated to a set of instructions from a defined quantum instruction-set architecture (ISA), which are executed by the control hardware. These translations can be done by a compiler, targeting different qubit technologies. Specifically for diamond NV centers, no compiler exists to perform this translation. Therefore, in this paper we present a compiler designed for quantum computers utilizing diamond NV center specific instructions, such as direct carbon control and partial swaps, to reduce execution times and gate count. Additionally, our compiler adds on top of general compilers by allowing classical instructions to perform state tomography and measurement-based operations. The output of the compiler is tested in a diamond NV center specific simulator. Comparing a general compiler output with the diamond NV center specific output of our compiler while applying decoherence and depolarization noise showed reduced noise effects due to diamond specific decomposition. The compiler was also tested to perform state tomography and measurement-based operations, which showed to be functional. Our results show that we have successfully created a compiler with integrated classical and quantum instructions support, which can improve circuit execution fidelity by utilizing diamond specific optimizations.

Abstract: Many living organisms can exploit quantum mechanical effects to gain distinct biological advantages. In plants, photosynthesis uses quantum coherence to achieve near 100% efficiency in energy transfer. With advances in experimental techniques, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy can reveal dynamic processes such as coherence and coupling within a system, and it plays an important role in studying energy transfer in photosynthesis. On the theory side, methods such as the generalized Bloch-Redfield theory and the hierarchical equations of motion are used to model photosynthetic systems. Quantum simulation, as a high-efficiency and low-complexity approach, has also made progress across various platforms in the study of photosynthesis. In recent years, a series of studies has introduced quantum coherence into artificial systems to enhance energy transfer efficiency, laying the groundwork for the design of coherent devices with efficient energy transport. Birds can use the weak geomagnetic field and spin-dependent chemical reactions to detect direction. Theoretical frameworks for animal navigation include magnetite-based mechanisms, magnetoreceptor genes, and the radical-pair mechanism. Quantum simulations of navigation have also advanced on multiple platforms. Inspired by animal navigation, diverse quantum effects have been applied to improve sensing and to support navigation tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive review of progress on quantum coherence in photosynthesis and avian navigation, along with related theoretical methods, quantum simulation approaches, and research on quantum coherent devices.

Abstract: We demonstrate a method for generating entanglement between trapped atomic ions based on adiabatically ramped state-dependent forces. By ramping both the amplitude of the state-dependent force and the motional mode frequencies, we realize an entangling operation that is robust to motional mode occupation and drifts in the mode frequencies. We measure Bell state fidelities above 0.99 across a broad range of ramp parameters and with motional occupations up to 10 phonons. This technique enables high-fidelity entangling operations without ground-state cooling, has a reduced calibration overhead, and is well suited for both quantum logic spectroscopy applications and scalable quantum computing architectures.

Motivation: 经典矩阵乘法权重方法在计算Lasserre松弛时的复杂度为O(n^{3k}poly(1/ε))，即使是无约束情况也很高。本文旨在开发更高效的量子算法来近似这些优化问题的松弛值。

Method: 使用基于矩阵乘法权重的量子算法，在适当系数缩放后，通过块编码技术实现Lasserre层次值的近似计算，无需QRAM支持。

Result: 对于固定k，算法运行时间为O(n^kε^{-4}+n^{k/2}ε^{-5})，在特定假设下比经典方法快超二次。例如，在投资组合优化中实现O(nε^{-4}+√nε^{-5})复杂度，优于经典的O(n^{ω+1}log(1/ε))。

Conclusion: 该方法在多项式优化问题的Lasserre松弛计算中实现了显著的量子加速，为相关优化问题提供了更高效的量子解决方案。

Abstract: We study quantum algorithms for approximating Lasserre's hierarchy values for polynomial optimization. Let $f,g_1,\ldots,g_m$ be real polynomials in $n$ variables and $f^\star$ the infimum of $f$ over the semialgebraic set $S(g)=\{x: g_i(x)\ge 0\}$. Let $λ_k$ be the value of the order-$k$ Lasserre relaxation. Assume either (i) $f^\star=λ_k$ and the optimum is attained in the $\ell_1$-ball of radius $1/2$, or (ii) $S(g)$ lies in the simplex $\{x\ge 0: \sum_j x_j\le 1/2\}$, and the constraints define this simplex. After an appropriate coefficient rescaling, we give a quantum algorithm based on matrix multiplicative weights that approximates $λ_k$ to accuracy $\varepsilon>0$ with runtime, for fixed $k$, \[ O(n^k\varepsilon^{-4}+n^{k/2}\varepsilon^{-5}),\qquad O\!\left(s_g\!\left[n^k\varepsilon^{-4}+\!\left(n^{k}+\!\sum_{i=1}^m n^{k-d_i}\right)^{1/2}\!\varepsilon^{-5}\right]\right), \] where $s_g$ bounds the sparsity of the coefficient-matching matrices associated with the constraints. Classical matrix multiplicative-weights methods scale as $O(n^{3k}\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$ even in the unconstrained case. As an example, we obtain an $O(n\varepsilon^{-4}+\sqrt{n}\varepsilon^{-5})$ quantum algorithm for portfolio optimization, improving over the classical $O(n^{ω+1}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ bound with $ω\approx2.373$.
  Our approach builds on and sharpens the analysis of Apeldoorn and Gilyén for the SDPs arising in polynomial optimization. We also show how to implement the required block encodings without QRAM. Under the stated assumptions, our method achieves a super-quadratic speedup in the problem dimension for computing Lasserre relaxations.

Abstract: Information scrambling, the process by which quantum information spreads and becomes effectively inaccessible, is central to modern quantum statistical physics and quantum chaos. These lecture notes provide an introduction to information scrambling from both static and dynamical perspectives. The spectral properties of reduced density matrices arising from Haar-random states are developed through the geometry of the unitary group and the universal results of random matrix theory. This geometric framework yields universal, model-independent predictions for entanglement and spectral statistics, capturing generic features of quantum chaos without reference to microscopic details. Dynamical diagnostics such as the spectral form factor and out-of-time-ordered correlators further reveal the onset of chaos in time-dependent evolution.
  The notes are aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students in physics, mathematics, and computer science who are interested in the connections between quantum chaos, information dynamics, and quantum computing. Concepts such as entanglement growth, Haar randomness, random-matrix statistics, and unitary t-designs are introduced through their realization in random quantum circuits and circuit complexity. The same mathematical framework also underpins modern quantum-device benchmarking, where approximate unitary designs and random circuits translate geometric ideas into quantitative tools for assessing fidelity, noise, and scrambling efficiency in real quantum processors.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization, where an optimization problem is subject to PDE constraints, arises in various applications such as design, control, and inference. Solving such problems is computationally demanding because it requires repeatedly solving a PDE and using its solution within an optimization process. In this paper, we first propose a fully coherent quantum algorithm for solving PDE-constrained optimization problems. The proposed method combines a quantum PDE solver that prepares the solution vector as a quantum state, and a quantum optimizer that assumes oracle access to a quantized objective function. The central idea is the explicit construction of the oracle in a form of block-encoding for the objective function, which coherently uses the output of a quantum PDE solver. This enables us to avoid classical access to the full solution that requires quantum state tomography canceling out the potential quantum speedups. We also derive the overall computational complexity of the proposed method with respect to parameters for optimization and PDE simulation, where quantum speedup is inherited from the underlying quantum PDE solver. We numerically demonstrate the validity of the proposed method by applications, including a parameter calibration problem in the Black-Scholes equation and a material parameter design problem in the wave equation. This work presents the concept of composing quantum subroutines so that the weakness of one (i.e., prohibitive readout overhead) is neutralized by the strength of another (i.e., coherent oracle access), toward a bottleneck-free quantum algorithm.

Abstract: The Dirac delta function potential is considered within the real Hilbert space approach for complex wave functions, as well as quaternionic wave functions. As has been previously determined, the real Hilbert space approach enables the possibility of self-interacting physical systems.

These results remark the differences between quaternionic quantum mechanics ($\mathbbm H$QM) and complex quantum mechanics ($\mathbbm C$QM), and also establish a method of solving the wave equation that may be applied to a variety of different cases.

Abstract: We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文首次在扫描电子显微镜中观察到高能电子（20 keV和30 keV）的Kapitza-Dirac效应，通过空间滤波检测电子横向动量谱中的光子边带，展示了电子与光场耦合强度增加时衍射级之间的相干可逆振荡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Kapitza-Dirac效应仅能在低能电子中观察到，因为可见光子的动量相对于高能电子的动量很小，导致衍射角度极小（10^(-4) rad或更小）。本文旨在突破这一限制，在高能电子中实现该效应。

Method: 使用扫描电子显微镜中的高能电子（20 keV和30 keV），通过两束干涉光波形成周期性光结构，在会聚束衍射几何中使用空间滤波检测电子横向动量谱中的光子边带。

Result: 成功观察到高能电子的Kapitza-Dirac效应，随着电子与光场耦合强度的增加，边带布居在衍射级之间表现出相干、可逆的振荡。

Conclusion: 该效应可作为相干电子束分离器或相位板应用于各种类型的电子显微镜中。

Abstract: Electron matter waves coherently diffract when passing through a periodic structure of light formed by two interfering light waves. In this so-called Kapitza-Dirac effect, the electron momentum changes due to absorption and emission of photons via stimulated Compton scattering. Until now, the effect has only been observed with low energy electrons due to the small momentum of a visible photon compared to the momentum of high energy electron leading to diffraction angles of 10^(-4) rad or smaller. We report on the observation of the Kapitza-Dirac effect in a scanning electron microscope using high energy (20 keV and 30 keV) electrons with de-Broglie wavelengths of 9 pm and 7 pm, respectively. The photon sidebands in the electron transverse momentum spectrum are detected in the convergent beam diffraction geometry using spatial filtering. As the coupling strength between the electrons and the light field increases, the sideband populations exhibit coherent, reversible oscillations among diffraction orders. The effect can serve as a coherent electron beam-splitter or a phase-plate in various types of electron microscopes.

Conclusion: H-QNG方法成功解决了QNG的计算成本问题，同时保持了参数化不变性，为变分量子本征求解器提供了更高效的优化方案。

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising algorithms for current quantum devices. It employs a classical optimizer to iteratively update the parameters of a variational quantum circuit in order to search for the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. The efficacy of VQEs largely depends on the optimizer employed. Recent studies suggest that Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNG) can achieve faster convergence than vanilla gradient descent (VG), but at the cost of additional quantum resources to estimate Fubini-Study metric tensor in each optimization step. The Fubini-Study metric tensor used in QNG is related to the entire quantum state space and does not incorporate information about the target Hamiltonian. To take advantage of the structure of the Hamiltonian and address the limitation of additional computational cost in QNG, we propose Hamiltonian-aware Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (H-QNG). In H-QNG, we propose to use the Riemannian pullback metric induced from the lower-dimensional subspace spanned by the Hamiltonian terms onto the parameter space. We show that H-QNG inherits the desirable features of both approaches: the low quantum computational cost of VG and the reparameterization-invariance of QNG. We also validate its performance through numerical experiments on molecular Hamiltonians, showing that H-QNG achieves faster convergence to chemical accuracy while requiring fewer quantum computational resources.

Abstract: We introduce a perturbative formulation for a nonlinear extension of the J-matrix method of scattering in two dimensions. That is, we obtain the scattering matrix for the time-independent nonlinear Schrödinger equation in two dimensions with circular symmetry. The formulation relies on the linearization of products of orthogonal polynomials and on the utilization of the tools of the J-matrix method. Gauss quadrature integral approximation is instrumental in the numerical implementation of the approach. We present the theory for a general ψ^{2n + 1} nonlinearity, where n is a natural number, and obtain results for the cubic and quintic nonlinearities, ψ^3 and ψ^5. At certain value(s) of the energy, we observe the occurrence of bifurcation with two stable solutions. This curious and interesting phenomenon is a clear signature and manifestation of the underlying nonlinearity.

Abstract: We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable. As a consequence, the effective dimension depends on the physical state of the system. Interestingly, systems of this form exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a harmonic oscillator for which the spatial dimension is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.

Abstract: Coherence is an inherently quantum property that deeply affects microscopic processes, including thermalization phenomena. A striking example is the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), in which a system can exhibit anomalous relaxation, thermalizing faster from a state initially farther from equilibrium than from one closer. Here, we experimentally investigate the genuine QME and observe how the dynamics of a spin-1/2 system interacting with a heat sink can be sped-up to equilibrium. Furthermore, we apply the QME in a quantum Otto refrigerator, thereby increasing its cooling power. This proof-of-concept experiment unveils new practical paths for improving quantum thermal tasks.

We numerically benchmark our method against constrained convex optimization (CCO) and show that it reaches higher or comparable reconstruction fidelity in much less time even in the presence of noise and limited probe state resources. We also present a possible extension of our approach to the phase sensitive case via a parametrization of POVMs on the complex Stiefel manifold which enables gradient based optimization restricted to this manifold.

Conclusion: 研究结果为tile码提供了新的结构洞见，确立了其作为容错量子计算构建模块的基础。

Abstract: The recently introduced tile codes are a promising alternative to surface codes, combining two-dimensional locality with higher encoding efficiency. While surface codes are well understood in terms of their logical operators and boundary behavior, much less is known about tile codes. In this work, we establish a natural and precise description of their logical operator space. We prove that, under mild assumptions, any tile code admits a canonical symplectic basis of logical operators supported along lattice boundaries, which can be generated efficiently by a simple cellular automaton with the number of update rules only depending on the non-locality of the tile code. Further, we develop algebraic and algebro-geometric frameworks for tile codes, by resolving them by translationally invariant Pauli stabilizer models and showing that they arise as derived sections of a Koszul complex on $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$. Finally, we introduce the concept of derived automorphisms for quantum codes. These are automorphism-like operations that can exist even for codes that do not have symmetries. We explain how derived automorphisms can be implemented for tile codes in a low-overhead and fault-tolerant manner by extending the lattice on one side and shrinking it on the other. While this operation is trivial for the surface code, it induces a product of logical CNOT gates on the encoded information. Our results provide new structural insights into tile codes and lay the groundwork for tile codes as building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: We develop an analytic framework to extract circuit parameters and loss tangent from superconducting transmission-line resonators terminated by reactive loads, extending analysis beyond the perturbative regime. The formulation yields closed-form relations between resonant frequency, participation ratio, and internal quality factor, removing the need for full-wave simulations. We validate the framework through circuit simulations, finite-element modeling, and experimental measurements of van der Waals parallel-plate capacitors, using it to extract the dielectric constant and loss tangent of hexagonal boron nitride. Statistical analysis across multiple reference resonators, together with multimode self-calibration, demonstrates consistent and reproducible extraction of both capacitance and loss tangent in close agreement with literature values. In addition to parameter extraction, the analytic relations provide practical design guidelines for maximizing energy participation ratio in the load and improving the precision of resonator-based material metrology.

TL;DR: 该论文为变分量子本征求解器(VQE)在显式几何条件下提供了噪声鲁棒的PAC全局最优性保证。假设低能区域是一个Morse-Bott子流形，其曲率维度r远小于参数维度p，证明了在这种几何机制下，找到ε最优区域的样本复杂度仅与曲率维度r相关，而非环境维度p。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究变分量子本征求解器在噪声环境下的全局优化可行性问题，旨在识别在何种几何条件下，即使存在测量噪声，高概率全局优化仍然可行。

Method: 假设周期性ansatz具有有界生成器，在环面参数空间上产生全局Lipschitz代价景观。假设包含全局最小值低能区域是一个Morse-Bott子流形，其法向Hessian的秩r=O(log p)，并满足多项式纤维正则性。

Result: 在假设条件下，找到ε最优区域且置信度为1-δ所需的样本复杂度与曲率维度r相关，而非环境维度p。算法以至少1-δ的概率输出一个区域，其中所有点都是ε最优的，且至少有一个点位于全局最小值的有限邻域内。

Conclusion: 识别了一个几何机制，其中只有少量方向控制能量变化，在这种机制下，尽管存在测量噪声，高概率全局优化仍然是可行的，复杂度在p和ε^{-1}上是拟多项式的，在δ^{-1}上是对数的。

Abstract: We give noise-robust, Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) guarantees of global $\varepsilon$-optimality for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver under explicit geometric conditions. For periodic ansatzes with bounded generators -- yielding a globally Lipschitz cost landscape on a toroidal parameter space -- we assume that the low-energy region containing the global minimum is a Morse--Bott submanifold whose normal Hessian has rank $r = O(\log p)$ for $p$ parameters, and which satisfies polynomial fiber regularity with respect to coordinate-aligned, embedded flats. This low-curvature-dimensional structure serves as a model for regimes in which only a small number of directions control energy variation, and is consistent with mechanisms such as strong parameter tying together with locality in specific multiscale and tied shallow architectures.
  Under this assumption, the sample complexity required to find an $\varepsilon$-optimal region with confidence $1-δ$ scales with the curvature dimension $r$ rather than the ambient dimension $p$. With probability at least $1-δ$, the algorithm outputs a region in which all points are $\varepsilon$-optimal, and at least one lies within a bounded neighborhood of the global minimum. The resulting complexity is quasi-polynomial in $p$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and logarithmic in $δ^{-1}$. This identifies a geometric regime in which high-probability global optimization remains feasible despite shot noise.

Abstract: This paper introduces the DIRSH algorithm for the Qubit Routing Problem (QRP), using a heuristic-guided randomized divide-and-conquer strategy. The method splits the circuit into chunks and optimizes each one with a stochastic selection of gates and swaps. It balances global search, via restarts and adaptive tuning of bandit parameters with depth-sensitive local pruning. Tested on RevLib benchmarks mapped to the 20-qubit IBMQ Tokyo topology, DIRSH outperformed three LightSABRE variants across different time budgets, achieving shorter depths and fewer swaps. These results confirm that combining chunk-based decomposition with bandit-driven heuristics is effective for routing quantum circuits on NISQ devices.

Abstract: Quantum information theory is a rapidly growing area of math and physics that combines two independent theories, quantum mechanics and information theory. Quantum entanglement is a concept that was first proposed in the EPR paradox. In quantum mechanics, particles can be in superposition, meaning they are in multiple different states at once. It is not until the particle is measured that it is forced into a single state. However, it is possible that particles can be tied to other particles, meaning that the measurement of one particle will determine the measurement of the other particle. Entanglement is at the very core of quantum information theory. It is one of the core pieces that allows for the massive increase in computing power. For this paper, we decided to focus on demonstrating the mathematical method (the Schmidt decomposition) for determining if a system is entangled, and a demonstration of quantum entanglement's use (quantum teleportation) as well as a quick look at how to extend the uses of the Schmidt decomposition.

Conclusion: 该方法在所有情况下都高效，所需的绝热演化时间与物理谱中能隙的倒数相当，为量子计算中的本征态制备提供了一种有效的引导策略。

Abstract: We introduce a method called resolution refinement that allows one to bootstrap eigenstate preparation on a quantum computer. We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution refinement applied to both single-particle basis states as well as a spatial lattice grid. For basis refinement, we compute few-body ground states of the Busch model for interacting particles in a harmonic trap in one dimension. For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time comparable to the inverse of the energy gap in the physical spectrum.

Abstract: We present an architecture for the generation of GKP states in which quadrature squeezing operations are used to control the average photon number statistics of probabilistic photon number measurements on Gaussian resource states. Specifically, we present an architecture employing a teleportation-based squeezing protocol and polynomial-gate applications integrated into a time-multiplexed multi-mode cluster state to generate cat states with high amplitudes, which are consequently used to generate GKP states with high quadrature effective squeezing. Compared to our previous work, in addition to using squeezing as a resource, the present architecture reduces damping and noise by minimizing the number of homodyne measurements required in GKP state generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these improvements - including dynamic input-state resetting and an improved breeding algorithm - by achieving a fault-tolerance threshold of 11.5 dB cluster squeezing using the RHG surface code for error correction, without requiring active switching or photon-number resource states.

Abstract: We present a gradient-based method to construct memory-efficient, high-fidelity, single-qubit gates for fluxonium qubits. These gates are constructed using a sequence of single-flux quantum (SFQ) pulses that are sent to the qubit through either capacitive or inductive coupling. The schedule of SFQ pulses is constructed with an on-ramp and an off-ramp applied prior to and after a pulse train, where the pulses are spaced at intervals equal to the qubit period. We reduce the optimization problem to the scheduling of a fixed number of SFQ pulses in the on-ramp and solve it by relaxing the discretization constraint of the SFQ clock as an intermediate step, allowing the use of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno optimizer. Using this approach, gate fidelities of 99.99 % can be achieved for inductive coupling and 99.9 % for capacitive coupling, with leakage being the main source of coherent errors for both approaches.
