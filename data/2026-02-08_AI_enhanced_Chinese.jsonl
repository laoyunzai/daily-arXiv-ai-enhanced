While it is known that there \\emph{exist} neural networks which can reason through any Boolean task $f:\\{0,1\\}^B\\to\\{0,1\\}$, in the sense that they emulate Boolean circuits with fan-in $2$ and fan-out $1$ gates, trained models have been repeatedly demonstrated to fall short of these theoretical ideals. This raises the question: \\textit{Can one exhibit a deep learning model which \\textbf{certifiably} always reasons and can \\textbf{universally} reason through any Boolean task?} Moreover, such a model should ideally require few parameters to solve simple Boolean tasks.\n  We answer this question affirmatively by exhibiting a deep learning architecture which parameterizes distributions over Boolean circuits with the guarantee that, for every parameter configuration, a sample is almost surely a valid Boolean circuit (and hence admits an intrinsic circuit-level certificate). We then prove a universality theorem: for any Boolean $f:\\{0,1\\}^B\\to\\{0,1\\}$, there exists a parameter configuration under which the sampled circuit computes $f$ with arbitrarily high probability. When $f$ is an $\\mathcal{O}(\\log B)$-junta, the required number of parameters scales linearly with the input dimension $B$.\n  Empirically, on a controlled truth-table completion benchmark aligned with our setting, the proposed architecture trains reliably and achieves high exact-match accuracy while preserving the predicted structure: every internal unit is Boolean-valued on $\\{0,1\\}^B$. Matched MLP baselines reach comparable accuracy, but only about $10\\%$ of hidden units admit a Boolean representation; i.e.\\ are two-valued over the Boolean cube.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents a deep learning architecture that certifiably reasons through all Boolean tasks by parameterizing distributions over valid Boolean circuits, with theoretical universality guarantees and empirical success where standard MLPs fail structural constraints.", "motivation": "The gap between theoretical existence of neural networks that can emulate any Boolean circuit and practical trained models failing to achieve certified, universal reasoning capabilities for Boolean tasks.", "method": "A novel deep learning architecture that parameterizes distributions over Boolean circuits, ensuring every parameter configuration almost surely produces a valid circuit (providing intrinsic certification), with proven universality for arbitrary Boolean functions.", "result": "1) Universality theorem: For any Boolean function f, exists parameter configuration making sampled circuit compute f with arbitrarily high probability; 2) For O(log B)-juntas, parameters scale linearly with input dimension B; 3) Empirical exact-match accuracy on truth-table completion with 100% Boolean-valued internal units, unlike MLP baselines (only ~10% Boolean units).", "conclusion": "The proposed architecture achieves the first certifiable universal Boolean reasoner that both theoretically guarantees circuit validity for all parameters and empirically maintains structural constraints (Boolean-valued units) while solving arbitrary Boolean tasks, outperforming conventional approaches in interpretability."}}

A key variant, sequence-to-graph alignment, plays a crucial role in effectively capturing genetic variations.

We show that solving the Gap-CLC problem in sub-quadratic time is highly unlikely unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) fails -- even when restricted to binary alphabets. Furthermore, we establish that the Edit-CLC problem is NP-hard in the presence of errors within the graph.

While asymmetric IR transmission at a specific incidence angle -- typically normal incidence -- is often emphasized, we show that such single-angle asymmetry is neither sufficient nor predictive of practical cooling performance. In this work, we demonstrate that effective non-contact PRC requires angularly distributed asymmetric IR transparency evaluated through hemispherical integration over emission directions, rather than asymmetry at a single incidence angle. To quantify this effect, an angle-resolved full-wave electromagnetic (EM) model with Bloch periodic boundary conditions and Floquet mode decomposition is employed to compute wavelength- and angle-dependent bidirectional reflection and transmission of periodic PRC structures. The resulting EM response is coupled to an energy-balance-based thermal model to predict the transient temperature evolution of the cooling object. By comparing models that account for the full angular distribution with normal-incidence-only approximations, we show that pronounced asymmetric transmission at normal incidence is generally not preserved at oblique angles. As a result, angular integration yields only marginal cooling or may even result in net heating, whereas normal-incidence-based models can substantially overestimate cooling performance.

However, as a collision kernel, it dose not guarantee the entrinsic detailed balance and is not integrable. In this work, the Pullin equation, which possesses an integrable collision kernel and satisfies the detailed balance constraint, is adopted as an extended Boltzmann equation for the theoretical analysis of near-continuum relaxation mechanisms. For clarity, only the translational and rotational degrees are considered in this work. Explicit analytical expressions for the temporal relaxation of macroscopic variables, including the stress force, (translational/rotational) temperature and heat flux, are obtained at the first time. This is achieved by approximating the distribution function in mixed Hermite and Laguerre for rotation and computing the collision operator moments, enabling a direct description of macroscopic non-equilibrium evolution. Base on the same elementary moment (integral) of collision operator, the macroscopic transport coefficients is found in Chapman-Enskog framework. The long-standing speculation, that thermal conduction coefficient should be depended on the degrees of thermal non-equilibrium, is rigorously confirmed and evaluated. When thermal equilibrium is enforced, the present thermal conduction coefficients can be degenerated to the famous results of Mason and Monchick. Given the correct relaxation rate, a Rykov-type novel relaxation model for Pullin equation is proposed. It can recover the interaction of transaltional and rotatioanl heat fluxes in relaxation process, which is ignored in the widely used Rykov equation. Finally, the precision of this new Rykov-type equation is examined using a series of benchmark test cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ePullin\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u539f\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u8fd1\u8fde\u7eed\u677e\u5f1b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u83b7\u5f97\u5b8f\u89c2\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5e94\u529b\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u70ed\u6d41\uff09\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5f1b\u8c6b\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u7cfb\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u70ed\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578bRykov\u677e\u5f1b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u539f\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u78b0\u649e\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Borgnakke-Larsen\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ec6\u81f4\u5e73\u8861\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u79ef\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u6ee1\u8db3\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7684\u6269\u5c55Boltzmann\u65b9\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u677e\u5f1b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ec6\u81f4\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u53ef\u79ef\u7684Pullin\u65b9\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u78b0\u649e\u6838\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408Hermite-Laguerre\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u78b0\u649e\u7b97\u5b50\u77e9\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5b8f\u89c2\u53d8\u91cf\u5f1b\u8c6b\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "1) \u9996\u6b21\u89e3\u6790\u83b7\u5f97\u5e94\u529b\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u70ed\u6d41\u7684\u5f1b\u8c6b\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u7cfb\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u70ed\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6001\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u5e73\u52a8-\u8f6c\u52a8\u70ed\u6d41\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u578bRykov\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8fd1\u8fde\u7eed\u533a\u6c14\u4f53\u677e\u5f1b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u65b0\u578bRykov\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}
