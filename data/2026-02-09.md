*H. Párraga,F. J. Arranz,R. M. Benito,F. Borondo*

TL;DR: Using variable Planck constant in vibrational energy level correlation diagrams reveals hidden quantum-classical connections in K-CN molecule's transition from order to chaos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study quantum manifestations of chaos in vibrational molecular systems by exposing hidden structures that remain invisible when using only the actual Planck constant value.

Method: Constructing correlation diagrams of vibrational energy levels while treating Planck constant as a variable parameter to analyze the highly nonlinear K-CN molecule.

Result: Regular classical structures (KAM tori) in mixed-phase space appear as emerging diabatic states in quantum correlation diagrams, and a quantum transition from order to chaos manifests as a frontier of scarred functions.

Conclusion: Variable-Planck correlation diagrams effectively unveil quantum-classical correspondence and chaos transition mechanisms in molecular systems that conventional methods obscure.

Abstract: The correlation diagrams of vibrational energy levels considering the Planck constant as a variable parameter have proven as a very useful tool to study vibrational molecular states, and more specifically in relation to the quantum manifestations of chaos in such dynamical systems. In this paper, we consider the highly nonlinear K-CN molecule, showing how the regular classical structures, i.e., Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser tori, existing in the mixed classical phase space appear in the quantum levels correlation diagram as emerging diabatic states, something that remains hidden when only the actual value of the Planck constant is considered. Additionally, a quantum transition from order to chaos is unveiled with the aid of these correlation diagrams, where it appears as a frontier of scarred functions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出动作诱导表示框架(AIRs)和变分实现(VAIR)，通过结合物理系统上的动作/实验来实现可证明的解耦表示学习，解决标准VAE无法完成非线性独立成分分析的根本难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习可解释的表示是表示学习的核心目标，主要挑战在于获得解耦表示（每个潜在维度对应独立生成因子），但标准VAE受限于无法实现非线性独立成分分析而难以达成此目标。

Method: 引入动作诱导表示(AIRs)框架，对物理系统及其可执行动作进行联合建模；设计变分AIR架构(VAIR)，通过利用动作与生成因子之间的依赖关系来提取可证明解耦的表示。

Result: 在AIR框架下可证明地解耦自由度与其动作依赖关系；VAIR在标准VAE失败的领域实现可证明解耦；VAIR还能捕获生成因子的动作依赖性，直接建立实验与所影响自由度之间的联系。

Conclusion: 通过将动作/实验纳入表示学习框架，AIR为可证明解耦提供了理论基础和实践架构，突破了标准VAE的根本局限，为可解释AI提供了新范式。

Abstract: Learning interpretable representations with variational autoencoders (VAEs) is a major goal of representation learning. The main challenge lies in obtaining disentangled representations, where each latent dimension corresponds to a distinct generative factor. This difficulty is fundamentally tied to the inability to perform nonlinear independent component analysis. Here, we introduce the framework of action-induced representations (AIRs) which models representations of physical systems given experiments (or actions) that can be performed on them. We show that, in this framework, we can provably disentangle degrees of freedom w.r.t. their action dependence. We further introduce a variational AIR architecture (VAIR) that can extract AIRs and therefore achieve provable disentanglement where standard VAEs fail. Beyond state representation, VAIR also captures the action dependence of the underlying generative factors, directly linking experiments to the degrees of freedom they influence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出系统性分析大语言模型推理中罕见事件的端到端框架，包含理论、生成策略、概率估计与误差分析全流程，解决部署时未观测事件可能大规模出现的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型作为概率模型在推理中会产生罕见但关键的事件，开发阶段未观测到的行为在巨量部署中可能频繁出现，亟需系统化分析方法。

Method: 构建端到端框架：结合理论分析、高效生成策略、概率估计方法及误差分析流程，并通过具体案例验证。

Result: 提供可落地的完整实现方案，涵盖从理论到实践的全链条工具链，以实例展示框架有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅解决LLM罕见事件分析问题，其概念和技术可推广至其他模型与场景，具有普适价值。

Abstract: Being probabilistic models, during inference large language models (LLMs) display rare events: behaviour that is far from typical but highly significant. By definition all rare events are hard to see, but the enormous scale of LLM usage means that events completely unobserved during development are likely to become prominent in deployment. Here we present an end-to-end framework for the systematic analysis of rare events in LLMs. We provide a practical implementation spanning theory, efficient generation strategies, probability estimation and error analysis, which we illustrate with concrete examples. We outline extensions and applications to other models and contexts, highlighting the generality of the concepts and techniques presented here.

TL;DR: 提出NanoNet框架解决轻量级半监督文本挖掘问题，通过在线知识蒸馏和互学习正则化实现参数高效学习，降低标注需求和计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级半监督学习策略存在计算密集、易陷入局部最优的问题，难以在有限标注样本下实现低成本高效推理

Method: 采用在线知识蒸馏生成多个小模型，通过互学习正则化增强性能，结合参数高效学习减少训练成本和标注需求

Result: 实现了轻量级文本挖掘框架，在降低监督需求和训练成本的同时，为下游推理提供高效轻量模型

Conclusion: NanoNet通过多模型协同蒸馏和参数高效学习，为资源受限场景下的文本挖掘提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The lightweight semi-supervised learning (LSL) strategy provides an effective approach of conserving labeled samples and minimizing model inference costs. Prior research has effectively applied knowledge transfer learning and co-training regularization from large to small models in LSL. However, such training strategies are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, thereby increasing the difficulty of finding the optimal solution. This has prompted us to investigate the feasibility of integrating three low-cost scenarios for text mining tasks: limited labeled supervision, lightweight fine-tuning, and rapid-inference small models. We propose NanoNet, a novel framework for lightweight text mining that implements parameter-efficient learning with limited supervision. It employs online knowledge distillation to generate multiple small models and enhances their performance through mutual learning regularization. The entire process leverages parameter-efficient learning, reducing training costs and minimizing supervision requirements, ultimately yielding a lightweight model for downstream inference.

### [5] [Toward Faithful and Complete Answer Construction from a Single Document](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06103)
*Zhaoyang Chen,Cody Fleming*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVE是一个结构化框架，通过提取、验证和枚举三步流程，突破LLMs在文档推理中的覆盖-准确率权衡，实现F1分数最高31%的提升，但受限于自然语言的固有歧义性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的统计式下一词元预测机制使其偏向生成高概率延续，缺乏确保回答完备性与忠实性的系统机制，这与AI安全原则存在根本冲突。

Method: EVE采用结构化、可验证的流水线，将高严谨性推理分解为提取、验证和枚举三个阶段，替代自由形式的提示。

Result: 召回率、精确率和F1分数分别提升最高24%、29%和31%，打破了单通道LLM生成中覆盖与准确率的长期权衡，同时缓解了长度限制导致的生成截断。

Conclusion: EVE能持续提升完备性和忠实性，但性能会因自然语言的固有歧义而饱和，体现了基于语言的推理的根本局限。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are powerful generators driven by statistical next-token prediction. While effective at producing fluent text, this design biases models toward high-probability continuations rather than exhaustive and faithful answers grounded in source content. As a result, directly applying LLMs lacks systematic mechanisms to ensure both completeness (avoiding omissions) and faithfulness (avoiding unsupported content), which fundamentally conflicts with core AI safety principles. To address this limitation, we present EVE, a structured framework for document-grounded reasoning.
  Unlike free-form prompting, EVE constrains generation to a structured, verifiable pipeline that decomposes high-rigor reasoning into extraction, validation, and enumeration. Empirically, this design enables consistent and simultaneous improvements in recall, precision, and F1-score: recall and precision increase by up to 24\% and 29\%, respectively, with a corresponding 31\% gain in F1-score. This effectively breaks the long-standing trade-off between coverage and accuracy typical of single-pass LLM generation, while also mitigating generation truncation caused by length limitations. At the same time, we emphasize that EVE exhibits performance saturation due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, reflecting fundamental limits of language-based reasoning.

### [6] [Pragmatic Curiosity: A Hybrid Learning-Optimization Paradigm via Active Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06104)
*Yingke Li,Anjali Parashar,Enlu Zhou,Chuchu Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes "pragmatic curiosity," a hybrid learning-optimization framework from active inference that unifies goal-seeking and information-seeking by minimizing expected free energy, outperforming traditional Bayesian methods on real-world coupled learning-optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineering and scientific workflows depend on expensive black-box evaluations where learning and optimization are intrinsically coupled, but existing Bayesian optimization (BO) and Bayesian experimental design (BED) methods treat goal-seeking and information-seeking separately with limited hybrid guidance.

Method: Proposes "pragmatic curiosity," a hybrid paradigm derived from active inference where actions are selected by minimizing expected free energy—a single objective that couples pragmatic utility (performance) with epistemic information gain (uncertainty reduction).

Result: Demonstrates practical effectiveness on real-world hybrid tasks (constrained system identification, targeted active search, composite optimization with unknown preferences), consistently outperforming BO-type and BED-type baselines with higher estimation accuracy, better critical-region coverage, and improved final solution quality.

Conclusion: Pragmatic curiosity provides a flexible and effective unified framework for intrinsically coupled learning-optimization problems, delivering superior performance across diverse benchmarks compared to separate goal-seeking or information-seeking approaches.

Abstract: Many engineering and scientific workflows depend on expensive black-box evaluations, requiring decision-making that simultaneously improves performance and reduces uncertainty. Bayesian optimization (BO) and Bayesian experimental design (BED) offer powerful yet largely separate treatments of goal-seeking and information-seeking, providing limited guidance for hybrid settings where learning and optimization are intrinsically coupled. We propose "pragmatic curiosity," a hybrid learning-optimization paradigm derived from active inference, in which actions are selected by minimizing the expected free energy--a single objective that couples pragmatic utility with epistemic information gain. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness and flexibility of pragmatic curiosity on various real-world hybrid tasks, including constrained system identification, targeted active search, and composite optimization with unknown preferences. Across these benchmarks, pragmatic curiosity consistently outperforms strong BO-type and BED-type baselines, delivering higher estimation accuracy, better critical-region coverage, and improved final solution quality.

### [7] [Compressing LLMs with MoP: Mixture of Pruners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06127)
*Bruno Lopes Yamamoto,Lucas Lauton de Alcantara,Victor Zacarias,Leandro Giusti Mugnaini,Keith Ando Ogawa,Lucas Pellicer,Rosimeire Pereira Costa,Edson Bollis,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoP (Mixture of Pruners) is an iterative framework that unifies depth and width pruning for LLMs, achieving superior accuracy, 39% latency reduction at 40% compression, and generalizes to vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have high computational demands; existing pruning methods focus on only one dimension (depth or width), limiting their effectiveness.

Method: MoP is an iterative framework that generates both depth-pruning and width-pruning branches at each iteration and selects the best candidate to advance the pruning path, unifying both dimensions.

Result: MoP exceeds competing methods' accuracy across compression regimes on LLaMA-2/3, outperforms depth-only/width-only pruning, reduces latency by 39% at 40% compression, and improves efficiency of LLaVA-1.5 vision-language model with text-only fine-tuning restoring visual task performance.

Conclusion: MoP successfully unifies depth and width pruning, advancing the state-of-the-art in structured pruning with real-world speedup and cross-modal applicability.

Abstract: The high computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate methods that reduce parameter count and accelerate inference. In response, model pruning emerges as an effective strategy, yet current methods typically focus on a single dimension-depth or width. We introduce MoP (Mixture of Pruners), an iterative framework that unifies these dimensions. At each iteration, MoP generates two branches-pruning in depth versus pruning in width-and selects a candidate to advance the path. On LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, MoP advances the frontier of structured pruning, exceeding the accuracy of competing methods across a broad set of compression regimes. It also consistently outperforms depth-only and width-only pruning. Furthermore, MoP translates structural pruning into real speedup, reducing end-to-end latency by 39% at 40% compression. Finally, extending MoP to the vision-language model LLaVA-1.5, we notably improve computational efficiency and demonstrate that text-only recovery fine-tuning can restore performance even on visual tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SWIRL是一个自改进框架，通过将动作视为潜变量，从仅有状态序列中学习世界模型。它交替优化前向世界模型（预测下一状态）和逆向动力学模型（预测动作），使用GRPO强化学习训练。在多个基准测试中性能显著提升：AURORABench +16%，ByteMorph +28%，WorldPredictionBench +16%，StableToolBench +14%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内部建模（预测在动作作用下从前一状态X到下一状态Y的转移）对于LLM和VLM的推理与规划至关重要。然而，学习此类模型通常需要昂贵的带动作标注的轨迹数据。因此，亟需一种能从仅有状态序列中学习世界模型的方法，以避免动作标注的高昂成本。

Method: 提出SWIRL框架：将动作作为潜变量处理，包含两个组件：前向世界模型FWM P_θ(Y|X,Z)和逆向动力学模型IDM Q_φ(Z|X,Y)。迭代两个阶段：(1) 变分信息最大化，更新FWM以生成使条件互信息最大的下一状态，确保可识别一致性；(2) ELBO最大化，更新IDM以解释观测到的状态转移。两个模型均采用GRPO强化学习训练，以对方冻结模型的log-probability作为奖励信号，实现坐标上升。

Result: 在LLM和VLM上评估，涵盖单轮和多轮开放世界视觉动力学以及物理、网页和工具调用的合成文本环境。性能提升显著：AURORABench上提升16%，ByteMorph上提升28%，WorldPredictionBench上提升16%，StableToolBench上提升14%。

Conclusion: SWIRL成功实现了从仅有状态序列中学习世界模型，证明了该自改进框架与交替优化策略的有效性。理论分析提供了可学习性保证，实验结果表明在多样化的环境中均能取得显著的性能改进，为降低世界模型对标注数据的依赖提供了新思路。

Abstract: Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states $X$ and next states $Y$ under actions $Z$ -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_θ(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_φ(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.

### [9] [Tempora: Characterising the Time-Contingent Utility of Online Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06136)
*Sudarshan Sreeram,Young D. Kwon,Cecilia Mascolo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tempora, a framework for evaluating test-time adaptation (TTA) methods under realistic temporal pressure (latency constraints), revealing that conventional performance rankings don't hold when time is limited, and the optimal method varies by corruption type and timing constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional TTA evaluations unrealistically assume unbounded processing time, ignoring the critical accuracy-latency trade-off that matters in real-world latency-sensitive deployments where predictions arriving too late are useless.

Method: Introduce Tempora framework with temporal scenarios modeling deployment constraints, evaluation protocols, and three time-contingent utility metrics: discrete utility for hard deadlines, continuous utility for interactive decay, and amortised utility for budget constraints.

Result: Testing seven TTA methods on ImageNet-C across 240 evaluations showed rank instability: state-of-the-art ETA underperformed in 41.2% of cases, and no single method was optimal across all corruption types and temporal pressures.

Conclusion: Tempora reveals when and why method rankings invert under temporal pressure, providing practitioners guidance for selection and researchers a benchmark for developing deployable adaptation methods.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a compelling remedy for machine learning (ML) models that degrade under domain shifts, improving generalisation on-the-fly with only unlabelled samples. This flexibility suits real deployments, yet conventional evaluations unrealistically assume unbounded processing time, overlooking the accuracy-latency trade-off. As ML increasingly underpins latency-sensitive and user-facing use-cases, temporal pressure constrains the viability of adaptable inference; predictions arriving too late to act on are futile. We introduce Tempora, a framework for evaluating TTA under this pressure. It consists of temporal scenarios that model deployment constraints, evaluation protocols that operationalise measurement, and time-contingent utility metrics that quantify the accuracy-latency trade-off. We instantiate the framework with three such metrics: (1) discrete utility for asynchronous streams with hard deadlines, (2) continuous utility for interactive settings where value decays with latency, and (3) amortised utility for budget-constrained deployments. Applying Tempora to seven TTA methods on ImageNet-C across 240 temporal evaluations reveals rank instability: conventional rankings do not predict rankings under temporal pressure; ETA, a state-of-the-art method in the conventional setting, falls short in 41.2% of evaluations. The highest-utility method varies with corruption type and temporal pressure, with no clear winner. By enabling systematic evaluation across diverse temporal constraints for the first time, Tempora reveals when and why rankings invert, offering practitioners a lens for method selection and researchers a target for deployable adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型和流匹配在离线强化学习中表现优异，但主要局限于连续动作空间，无法应用于更广泛的离散动作或多智能体场景

Method: 提出通用框架：1) 用连续时间马尔可夫链替换连续流；2) 采用Q加权流匹配目标训练；3) 设计因子化条件路径处理多智能体设置；4) 通过动作量化扩展至连续控制

Result: 理论证明理想条件下可恢复最优策略；实验验证在高维控制、多模态决策、多目标动态偏好等实际场景中具有鲁棒性，且通过量化实现表征复杂度与性能的灵活权衡

Conclusion: 该离散框架成功将流匹配推广到更广泛的离线RL设置，支持离散/连续动作、多智能体、多目标等场景，性能强劲且灵活

Abstract: Generative policies based on diffusion models and flow matching have shown strong promise for offline reinforcement learning (RL), but their applicability remains largely confined to continuous action spaces. To address a broader range of offline RL settings, we extend flow matching to a general framework that supports discrete action spaces with multiple objectives. Specifically, we replace continuous flows with continuous-time Markov chains, trained using a Q-weighted flow matching objective. We then extend our design to multi-agent settings, mitigating the exponential growth of joint action spaces via a factorized conditional path. We theoretically show that, under idealized conditions, optimizing this objective recovers the optimal policy. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that our method performs robustly in practical scenarios, including high-dimensional control, multi-modal decision-making, and dynamically changing preferences over multiple objectives. Our discrete framework can also be applied to continuous-control problems through action quantization, providing a flexible trade-off between representational complexity and performance.

*Prashant Mehta,Sean Meyn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究线性函数逼近Q学习的稳定性与PBE解的唯一性，通过反例表明收敛需要比标准假设更强的结构性条件，即使在理想基函数下仍可能出现多解和不稳定现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前工作虽在$(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs策略下证明了稳定性与解的存在性，但解的唯一性以及在非标准MDP设置下的收敛标准仍是未解问题，亟需澄清。

Method: 扩展先前结果至其他Q学习变体；构造一维反例分析oblivious策略下的无解/多解问题；研究理想基函数在greedy和tamed Gibbs策略下的PBE解结构。

Result: 1) oblivious训练策略可导致PBE无解或多解，算法不稳定；2) 即使基函数张成真实Q函数，greedy策略仍有两个PBE解，且对任意小$\varepsilon>0$和$κ\ge1$，$(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs策略也产生多解；3) 收敛需要远超标准假设的结构性条件。

Conclusion: Q学习在线性函数逼近下的收敛性对问题结构高度敏感，标准假设不足以保证PBE解的唯一性，必须施加更强的结构性约束才能确保算法稳定收敛。

Abstract: In recent work it is shown that Q-learning with linear function approximation is stable, in the sense of bounded parameter estimates, under the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy; $κ$ is inverse temperature, and $\varepsilon>0$ is introduced for additional exploration. Under these assumptions it also follows that there is a solution to the projected Bellman equation (PBE). Left open is uniqueness of the solution, and criteria for convergence outside of the standard tabular or linear MDP settings.
  The present work extends these results to other variants of Q-learning, and clarifies prior work: a one dimensional example shows that under an oblivious policy for training there may be no solution to the PBE, or multiple solutions, and in each case the algorithm is not stable under oblivious training.
  The main contribution is that far more structure is required for convergence. An example is presented for which the basis is ideal, in the sense that the true Q-function is in the span of the basis. However, there are two solutions to the PBE under the greedy policy, and hence also for the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy for all sufficiently small $\varepsilon>0$ and $κ\ge 1$.

*Nurbek Tastan,Stefanos Laskaridis,Karthik Nandakumar,Samuel Horvath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoSE introduces slimmable experts in Mixture-of-Experts to enable continuous accuracy-computation trade-offs, outperforming standard MoE with fewer FLOPs


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MoE models exhibit large discontinuities in accuracy-compute trade-offs because once an expert is selected, it is executed fully without flexibility

Method: Propose MoSE with nested slimmable experts per layer, train with multi-width training combined with standard MoE objectives, and use runtime width determination strategies including lightweight test-time training to map router confidence to expert widths under fixed budgets

Result: On GPT models trained with OpenWebText, MoSE matches or improves standard MoE at full width while consistently shifting the Pareto frontier, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer FLOPs

Conclusion: MoSE enables a single pretrained model to support a continuous spectrum of accuracy-compute trade-offs at inference time, improving efficiency over standard MoE architectures

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale large language models efficiently by sparsely activating experts, but once an expert is selected, it is executed fully. Hence, the trade-off between accuracy and computation in an MoE model typically exhibits large discontinuities. We propose Mixture of Slimmable Experts (MoSE), an MoE architecture in which each expert has a nested, slimmable structure that can be executed at variable widths. This enables conditional computation not only over which experts are activated, but also over how much of each expert is utilized. Consequently, a single pretrained MoSE model can support a more continuous spectrum of accuracy-compute trade-offs at inference time. We present a simple and stable training recipe for slimmable experts under sparse routing, combining multi-width training with standard MoE objectives. During inference, we explore strategies for runtime width determination, including a lightweight test-time training mechanism that learns how to map router confidence/probabilities to expert widths under a fixed budget. Experiments on GPT models trained on OpenWebText demonstrate that MoSE matches or improves upon standard MoE at full width and consistently shifts the Pareto frontier for accuracy vs. cost, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer FLOPs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了扩散模型高维潜空间中初始噪声种子与生成样本类别之间的关系，发现通过分类器置信度分数筛选高置信度样本时，潜空间中会出现明显的类别可分离结构，这为基于置信度过滤的条件生成提供了理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究扩散模型的高维潜空间是否包含足够的结构来预测生成样本的属性（如类别），并理解这种结构在何种条件下显现。

Method: 通过预训练分类器为生成样本分配置信度分数，比较高置信度与低置信度噪声子集在潜空间中的类别可预测性，分析置信度过滤对潜空间结构的影响。

Result: 当考虑所有噪声实现时潜空间看似无结构，但限制在产生高置信度样本的初始噪声种子时，会出现显著的类别可分离性；这种类别相关潜结构仅在基于置信度的过滤下才可观测。

Conclusion: 潜空间中确实存在潜在的类别相关结构，但需要置信度过滤才能显现；该发现支持将置信度过滤作为替代引导方法的条件生成途径。

Abstract: Diffusion models rely on a high-dimensional latent space of initial noise seeds, yet it remains unclear whether this space contains sufficient structure to predict properties of the generated samples, such as their classes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of latent structure through the lens of confidence scores assigned by a pre-trained classifier to generated samples. We show that while the latent space appears largely unstructured when considering all noise realizations, restricting attention to initial noise seeds that produce high-confidence samples reveals pronounced class separability. By comparing class predictability across noise subsets of varying confidence and examining the class separability of the latent space, we find evidence of class-relevant latent structure that becomes observable only under confidence-based filtering. As a practical implication, we discuss how confidence-based filtering enables conditional generation as an alternative to guidance-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCONE是一个插件式模块，通过直接在隐空间执行四进制算术编码并实时施加生化约束，将神经压缩与DNA编码整合为单一步骤，在几乎不增加计算开销的情况下实现近乎完美的约束满足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DNA存储管线在神经压缩与DNA编码的整合上效率低下，通常通过朴素的二进制-四进制转码将学习到的隐表示转换为DNA碱基，既丢弃了熵模型的优化潜力，又需要后验约束修正，降低了压缩效率并增加了系统复杂度。

Method: 提出SCONE框架，在隐空间直接执行四进制算术编码，并通过约束感知自适应编码模块动态引导熵编码器的学习概率分布，在编码过程中确定性实施GC平衡和同聚物抑制等生化约束，保持完全可逆性且不修改超先验模型。

Result: 实验表明SCONE以可忽略的计算开销（<2%延迟）实现近乎完美的约束满足，为端到端DNA兼容的学习编解码器建立了隐空间无关的接口。

Conclusion: SCONE成功将神经压缩与DNA编码统一为单一步骤，在保持压缩效率的同时消除了后验修正需求，为实用化DNA存储系统提供了更精简有效的解决方案。

Abstract: DNA storage has matured from concept to practical stage, yet its integration with neural compression pipelines remains inefficient. Early DNA encoders applied redundancy-heavy constraint layers atop raw binary data - workable but primitive. Recent neural codecs compress data into learned latent representations with rich statistical structure, yet still convert these latents to DNA via naive binary-to-quaternary transcoding, discarding the entropy model's optimization. This mismatch undermines compression efficiency and complicates the encoding stack. A plug-in module that collapses latent compression and DNA encoding into a single step. SCONE performs quaternary arithmetic coding directly on the latent space in DNA bases. Its Constraint-Aware Adaptive Coding module dynamically steers the entropy encoder's learned probability distribution to enforce biochemical constraints - Guanine-Cytosine (GC) balance and homopolymer suppression - deterministically during encoding, eliminating post-hoc correction. The design preserves full reversibility and exploits the hyperprior model's learned priors without modification. Experiments show SCONE achieves near-perfect constraint satisfaction with negligible computational overhead (<2% latency), establishing a latent-agnostic interface for end-to-end DNA-compatible learned codecs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练中矩阵乘法（尤其Transformer的FFN层）成为计算瓶颈，FFN占比随模型增大可达50%总FLOPs，亟需高效加速方案

Method: 采用硬件加速的稀疏训练：权重使用2:4稀疏模式，激活采用v:n:m稀疏；训练中交替进行稀疏训练（主体阶段）与稠密微调（后期阶段）

Result: 在保持模型基准测试性能不变的前提下，端到端训练速度提升1.4-1.7倍；适用于NVIDIA A100及以上GPU，兼容量化/混合专家等优化技术

Conclusion: 该稀疏训练方案能有效突破FFN计算瓶颈，硬件普适性强且与其他优化正交，为大规模模型训练提供新路径

Abstract: Trainings of Large Language Models are generally bottlenecked by matrix multiplications. In the Transformer architecture, a large portion of these operations happens in the Feed Forward Network (FFN), and this portion increases for larger models, up to 50% of the total pretraining floating point operations. We show that we can leverage hardware-accelerated sparsity to accelerate all matrix multiplications in the FFN, with 2:4 sparsity for weights and v:n:m (Venom) sparsity for activations. Our recipe relies on sparse training steps to accelerate a large part of the pretraining, associated with regular dense training steps towards the end. Overall, models trained with this approach exhibit the same performance on our quality benchmarks, and can speed up training end-to-end by 1.4 to 1.7x. This approach is applicable to all NVIDIA GPUs starting with the A100 generation, and is orthogonal to common optimization techniques, such as, quantization, and can also be applied to mixture-of-experts model architectures.

Conclusion: 该框架为联邦学习提供了高效的数据遗忘解决方案，兼容性强，在遗忘效果与模型性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative machine learning across decentralized data sources, preserving privacy by keeping data local. However, increasing legal and ethical demands, such as the "right to be forgotten", and the need to mitigate data poisoning attacks have underscored the urgent necessity for principled data unlearning in FL. Unlike centralized settings, the distributed nature of FL complicates the removal of individual data contributions. In this paper, we propose a novel federated unlearning framework formulated as a min-max optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize an $f$-divergence between the model trained with all data and the model retrained without specific data points, while minimizing the degradation on retained data. Our framework could act like a plugin and be added to almost any federated setup, unlike SOTA methods like (\cite{10269017} which requires model degradation in server, or \cite{khalil2025notfederatedunlearningweight} which requires to involve model architecture and model weights). This formulation allows for efficient approximation of data removal effects in a federated setting. We provide empirical evaluations to show that our method achieves significant speedups over naive retraining, with minimal impact on utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Maximal-Update Adaptation (μA)理论框架，系统性地解决LoRA最优学习率随秩缩放的问题，识别出两种缩放机制，并实现LoRA到全参数微调的学习率迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA微调的训练动态复杂，最优学习率与适配器秩的关系不明确，导致实践中每次改变秩都需要重新调参，效率低下。

Method: 受预训练中μP的启发，结合超参数迁移技术，建立μA理论框架，分析在标准配置下产生稳定非消失特征更新的最优学习率缩放规律。

Result: 识别出两种缩放机制：学习率在秩间基本不变，或与秩成反比；发现一种配置可实现LoRA到全参数微调的学习率直接迁移，大幅降低调参成本。

Conclusion: μA为LoRA学习率调优提供了理论基础，实现了高效的超参数迁移，在语言、视觉、生成和强化学习等多领域实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a standard tool for parameter-efficient finetuning of large models. While it induces a small memory footprint, its training dynamics can be surprisingly complex as they depend on several hyperparameters such as initialization, adapter rank, and learning rate. In particular, it is unclear how the optimal learning rate scales with adapter rank, which forces practitioners to re-tune the learning rate whenever the rank is changed. In this paper, we introduce Maximal-Update Adaptation ($μ$A), a theoretical framework that characterizes how the "optimal" learning rate should scale with model width and adapter rank to produce stable, non-vanishing feature updates under standard configurations. $μ$A is inspired from the Maximal-Update Parametrization ($μ$P) in pretraining. Our analysis leverages techniques from hyperparameter transfer and reveals that the optimal learning rate exhibits different scaling patterns depending on initialization and LoRA scaling factor. Specifically, we identify two regimes: one where the optimal learning rate remains roughly invariant across ranks, and another where it scales inversely with rank. We further identify a configuration that allows learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning, drastically reducing the cost of learning rate tuning for full finetuning. Experiments across language, vision, vision--language, image generation, and reinforcement learning tasks validate our scaling rules and show that learning rates tuned on LoRA transfer reliably to full finetuning.

TL;DR: This paper theoretically and experimentally proves that weight dynamics in deep neural networks concentrate within invariant low-dimensional subspaces during training, enabling efficient low-rank parameterizations that match full-model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing empirical observations show large-scale deep neural networks train in low-dimensional subspaces, but theoretical justification for this phenomenon in nonlinear networks (compared to linear settings) remains insufficient.

Method: Analyzes gradient descent learning dynamics of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs); theoretically characterizes invariant low-dimensional subspaces for two-layer networks with smooth activations, then experimentally validates generalizability beyond theoretical assumptions.

Result: (1) Weight dynamics concentrate in invariant low-dimensional subspaces throughout training; (2) A low-rank MLP parameterization initialized within these subspaces achieves classification performance equivalent to fully-parameterized models across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: Theoretical characterization of low-dimensional training dynamics bridges the gap between empirical observations and nonlinear network theory, providing foundation for efficient low-rank training methods without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent empirical evidence has demonstrated that the training dynamics of large-scale deep neural networks occur within low-dimensional subspaces. While this has inspired new research into low-rank training, compression, and adaptation, theoretical justification for these dynamics in nonlinear networks remains limited. %compared to deep linear settings. To address this gap, this paper analyzes the learning dynamics of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) under gradient descent (GD). We demonstrate that the weight dynamics concentrate within invariant low-dimensional subspaces throughout training. Theoretically, we precisely characterize these invariant subspaces for two-layer networks with smooth nonlinear activations, providing insight into their emergence. Experimentally, we validate that this phenomenon extends beyond our theoretical assumptions. Leveraging these insights, we empirically show there exists a low-rank MLP parameterization that, when initialized within the appropriate subspaces, matches the classification performance of fully-parameterized counterparts on a variety of classification tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The growth of machine learning demands interpretable models for critical applications, yet most high-performing models are ``black-box'' systems that obscure input-output relationships, while traditional rule-based algorithms like RuleFit suffer from a lack of predictive power and instability despite their simplicity. This motivated our development of Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression Rule-Fit (SR4-Fit), a novel interpretable classification algorithm that addresses these limitations while maintaining superior classification performance. Using demographic characteristics of U.S. congressional districts from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we demonstrate that SR4-Fit can predict House election party outcomes with unprecedented accuracy and interpretability. Our results show that while the majority party remains the strongest predictor, SR4-Fit has revealed intrinsic combinations of demographic factors that affect prediction outcomes that were unable to be interpreted in black-box algorithms such as random forests. The SR4-Fit algorithm surpasses both black-box models and existing interpretable rule-based algorithms such as RuleFit with respect to accuracy, simplicity, and robustness, generating stable and interpretable rule sets while maintaining superior predictive performance, thus addressing the traditional trade-off between model interpretability and predictive capability in electoral forecasting. To further validate SR4-Fit's performance, we also apply it to six additional publicly available classification datasets, like the breast cancer, Ecoli, page blocks, Pima Indians, vehicle, and yeast datasets, and find similar results.

TL;DR: RuleSmith uses multi-agent LLMs and Bayesian optimization to automate game balancing, tested on a simplified civilization game with successful convergence to balanced configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Game balancing is a longstanding challenge requiring tedious manual playtesting, expert intuition, and extensive tuning.

Method: Proposes RuleSmith framework combining a game engine, multi-agent LLMs for rule interpretation and self-play, and Bayesian optimization with adaptive sampling to efficiently search multi-dimensional rule spaces.

Result: Achieved highly balanced configurations on CivMini (a simplified civilization game), with interpretable rule adjustments directly applicable to downstream game systems.

Conclusion: LLM simulation serves as a powerful surrogate for automating design and balancing in complex multi-agent environments.

Abstract: Game balancing is a longstanding challenge requiring repeated playtesting, expert intuition, and extensive manual tuning. We introduce RuleSmith, the first framework that achieves automated game balancing by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of multi-agent LLMs. It couples a game engine, multi-agent LLMs self-play, and Bayesian optimization operating over a multi-dimensional rule space. As a proof of concept, we instantiate RuleSmith on CivMini, a simplified civilization-style game containing heterogeneous factions, economy systems, production rules, and combat mechanics, all governed by tunable parameters. LLM agents interpret textual rulebooks and game states to generate actions, to conduct fast evaluation of balance metrics such as win-rate disparities. To search the parameter landscape efficiently, we integrate Bayesian optimization with acquisition-based adaptive sampling and discrete projection: promising candidates receive more evaluation games for accurate assessment, while exploratory candidates receive fewer games for efficient exploration. Experiments show that RuleSmith converges to highly balanced configurations and provides interpretable rule adjustments that can be directly applied to downstream game systems. Our results illustrate that LLM simulation can serve as a powerful surrogate for automating design and balancing in complex multi-agent environments.

TL;DR: PEPO is a single-step DPO-like algorithm that uses pessimistic ensemble methods to prevent over-optimization in preference learning, achieving better theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the well-known over-optimization issue in preference learning without requiring knowledge of data-generating distributions or learning explicit reward models.

Method: Uses an ensemble of preference-optimized policies trained on disjoint data subsets, aggregated through a worst-case construction that favors agreement across models.

Result: Achieves sample complexity guarantees depending only on single-policy concentrability coefficient (avoiding all-policy concentrability that plagues DPO), with convincing practical performance while retaining DPO's simplicity.

Conclusion: PEPO successfully combines theoretical soundness with practical effectiveness, providing a robust solution to over-optimization in preference learning.

Abstract: We introduce PEPO (Pessimistic Ensemble based Preference Optimization), a single-step Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-like algorithm to mitigate the well-known over-optimization issue in preference learning without requiring the knowledge of the data-generating distribution or learning an explicit reward model. PEPO achieves pessimism via an ensemble of preference-optimized policies trained on disjoint data subsets and then aggregates them through a worst case construction that favors the agreement across models. In the tabular setting, PEPO achieves sample complexity guarantees depending only on a single-policy concentrability coefficient, thus avoiding the all-policy concentrability which affects the guarantees of algorithms prone to over-optimization, such as DPO. The theoretical findings are corroborated by a convincing practical performance, while retaining the simplicity and the practicality of DPO-style training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘评估依赖良性查询，易将信息表面抑制误判为真实知识移除，无法检测通过高级提示策略仍可提取的残留知识，导致遗忘效果被高估。

Method: 提出REBEL框架，采用进化算法生成对抗性提示，主动探测模型中是否仍存在可恢复的"遗忘"知识，并在TOFU和WMDP基准的子集上测试多种遗忘算法。

Result: REBEL显著优于静态基线，在TOFU上攻击成功率(ASR)达60%，WMDP高达93%，证实当前遗忘方法未能彻底移除知识，仅实现表层防护。

Conclusion: 标准评估体系存在重大缺陷，现有机器遗忘方法提供的知识移除效果有限，需开发更鲁棒的评估框架和真正的知识消除技术。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for LLMs aims to remove sensitive or copyrighted data from trained models. However, the true efficacy of current unlearning methods remains uncertain. Standard evaluation metrics rely on benign queries that often mistake superficial information suppression for genuine knowledge removal. Such metrics fail to detect residual knowledge that more sophisticated prompting strategies could still extract. We introduce REBEL, an evolutionary approach for adversarial prompt generation designed to probe whether unlearned data can still be recovered. Our experiments demonstrate that REBEL successfully elicits ``forgotten'' knowledge from models that seemed to be forgotten in standard unlearning benchmarks, revealing that current unlearning methods may provide only a superficial layer of protection. We validate our framework on subsets of the TOFU and WMDP benchmarks, evaluating performance across a diverse suite of unlearning algorithms. Our experiments show that REBEL consistently outperforms static baselines, recovering ``forgotten'' knowledge with Attack Success Rates (ASRs) reaching up to 60% on TOFU and 93% on WMDP. We will make all code publicly available upon acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/patryk-rybak/REBEL/

Motivation: 现有模型引导研究过度关注效果，缺乏对干预是否仅改变目标属性的评估，尤其缺少对目标属性相关行为意外变化及分布偏移下鲁棒性的系统性考察

Method: 构建三维特异性评估框架：通用性（保持流畅性和无关能力）、控制性（保持相关控制属性）和鲁棒性（分布偏移下保持控制属性），并在拒绝过度审查和忠实性幻觉两个安全关键场景进行实证检验

Result: 引导方法虽高效且基本维持通用性和控制性特异性，但一致性地无法保持鲁棒性特异性；如拒绝过度审查引导虽不损害通用能力和有害查询拒绝，但显著增加越狱脆弱性

Conclusion: 标准效果和特异性检查不足，缺乏鲁棒性评估会使引导方法在危及模型安全时仍表现可靠，必须将鲁棒性纳入评估体系

Abstract: Model steering, which involves intervening on hidden representations at inference time, has emerged as a lightweight alternative to finetuning for precisely controlling large language models. While steering efficacy has been widely studied, evaluations of whether interventions alter only the intended property remain limited, especially with respect to unintended changes in behaviors related to the target property. We call this notion specificity. We propose a framework that distinguishes three dimensions of specificity: general (preserving fluency and unrelated abilities), control (preserving related control properties), and robustness (preserving control properties under distribution shifts). We study two safety-critical use cases: steering models to reduce overrefusal and faithfulness hallucinations, and show that while steering achieves high efficacy and largely maintains general and control specificity, it consistently fails to preserve robustness specificity. In the case of overrefusal steering, for example, all steering methods reduce overrefusal without harming general abilities and refusal on harmful queries; however, they substantially increase vulnerability to jailbreaks. Our work provides the first systematic evaluation of specificity in model steering, showing that standard efficacy and specificity checks are insufficient, because without robustness evaluation, steering methods may appear reliable even when they compromise model safety.

Abstract: Online strategic classification studies settings in which agents strategically modify their features to obtain favorable predictions. For example, given a classifier that determines loan approval based on credit scores, applicants may open or close credit cards and bank accounts to obtain a positive prediction. The learning goal is to achieve low mistake or regret bounds despite such strategic behavior.
  While randomized algorithms have the potential to offer advantages to the learner in strategic settings, they have been largely underexplored. In the realizable setting, no lower bound is known for randomized algorithms, and existing lower bound constructions for deterministic learners can be circumvented by randomization. In the agnostic setting, the best known regret upper bound is $O(T^{3/4}\log^{1/4}T|\mathcal H|)$, which is far from the standard online learning rate of $O(\sqrt{T\log|\mathcal H|})$.
  In this work, we provide refined bounds for online strategic classification in both settings. In the realizable setting, we extend, for $T > \mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal{H}) Δ^2$, the existing lower bound $Ω(\mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal{H}) Δ)$ for deterministic learners to all learners. This yields the first lower bound that applies to randomized learners. We also provide the first randomized learner that improves the known (deterministic) upper bound of $O(\mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal H) \cdot Δ\log Δ)$.
  In the agnostic setting, we give a proper learner using convex optimization techniques to improve the regret upper bound to $O(\sqrt{T \log |\mathcal{H}|} + |\mathcal{H}| \log(T|\mathcal{H}|))$. We show a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors for all proper learning rules, demonstrating the optimality of our learner among proper learners. As such, improper learning is necessary to further improve regret guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit), a method that uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to remove safety constraints from AI models with just a single unlabeled prompt, significantly outperforming existing techniques while preserving model utility and generalizing to image generation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety alignment is fragile and can be easily undone through post-deployment fine-tuning, but current unalignment methods require extensive data curation and severely degrade model utility, limiting their practical application.

Method: The authors propose GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit), which leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly eliminate safety constraints from target models using minimal data—only a single unlabeled prompt is needed.

Result: GRP-Oblit achieves stronger unalignment than state-of-the-art methods while largely preserving model utility, and demonstrates generalization beyond language models to diffusion-based image generation systems.

Conclusion: The research reveals critical vulnerabilities in current safety alignment approaches by demonstrating that safety constraints can be reliably removed with minimal intervention, exposing a significant security weakness in deployed AI systems.

Abstract: Safety alignment is only as robust as its weakest failure mode. Despite extensive work on safety post-training, it has been shown that models can be readily unaligned through post-deployment fine-tuning. However, these methods often require extensive data curation and degrade model utility.
  In this work, we extend the practical limits of unalignment by introducing GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit), a method that uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly remove safety constraints from target models. We show that a single unlabeled prompt is sufficient to reliably unalign safety-aligned models while largely preserving their utility, and that GRP-Oblit achieves stronger unalignment on average than existing state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, GRP-Oblit generalizes beyond language models and can also unalign diffusion-based image generation systems.
  We evaluate GRP-Oblit on six utility benchmarks and five safety benchmarks across fifteen 7-20B parameter models, spanning instruct and reasoning models, as well as dense and MoE architectures. The evaluated model families include GPT-OSS, distilled DeepSeek, Gemma, Llama, Ministral, and Qwen.

Abstract: We propose a novel deterministic purification method to improve adversarial robustness by mapping a potentially adversarial sample toward a nearby sample that lies close to a mode of the data distribution, where classifiers are more reliable. We design the method to be deterministic to ensure reliable test accuracy and to prevent the degradation of effective robustness observed in stochastic purification approaches when the adversary has full knowledge of the system and its randomness. We employ a score model trained by minimizing the expected reconstruction error of noise-corrupted data, thereby learning the structural characteristics of the input data distribution. Given a potentially adversarial input, the method searches within its local neighborhood for a purified sample that minimizes the expected reconstruction error under noise corruption and then feeds this purified sample to the classifier. During purification, sharpness-aware minimization is used to guide the purified samples toward flat regions of the expected reconstruction error landscape, thereby enhancing robustness. We further show that, as the noise level decreases, minimizing the expected reconstruction error biases the purified sample toward local maximizers of the Gaussian-smoothed density; under additional local assumptions on the score model, we prove recovery of a local maximizer in the small-noise limit. Experimental results demonstrate significant gains in adversarial robustness over state-of-the-art methods under strong deterministic white-box attacks.

Abstract: We address the problem of training conversion prediction models in advertising domains under privacy constraints, where direct links between ad clicks and conversions are unavailable. Motivated by privacy-preserving browser APIs and the deprecation of third-party cookies, we study a setting where the learner observes a sequence of clicks and a sequence of conversions, but can only link a conversion to a set of candidate clicks (an attribution set) rather than a unique source. We formalize this as learning from attribution sets generated by an oblivious adversary equipped with a prior distribution over the candidates. Despite the lack of explicit labels, we construct an unbiased estimator of the population loss from these coarse signals via a novel approach. Leveraging this estimator, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization achieves generalization guarantees that scale with the informativeness of the prior and is also robust against estimation errors in the prior, despite complex dependencies among attribution sets. Simple empirical evaluations on standard datasets suggest our unbiased approach significantly outperforms common industry heuristics, particularly in regimes where attribution sets are large or overlapping.

Abstract: Exploiting sparsity during long-context inference is central to scaling large language models, as attention dominates the cost of autoregressive decoding. Sparse attention reduces this cost by restricting computation to a subset of tokens, but its effectiveness depends critically on efficient scoring and selection of relevant tokens at inference time. We revisit Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) as a sparsification primitive and introduce SOCKET, a SOft Collision Kernel EsTimator that replaces hard bucket matches with probabilistic, similarity-aware aggregation. Our key insight is that hard LSH produces discrete collision signals and is therefore poorly suited for ranking. In contrast, soft LSH aggregates graded collision evidence across hash tables, preserving the stability of relative ordering among the true top-$k$ tokens. This transformation elevates LSH from a candidate-generation heuristic to a principled and mathematically grounded scoring kernel for sparse attention. Leveraging this property, SOCKET enables efficient token selection without ad-hoc voting mechanism, and matches or surpasses established sparse attention baselines across multiple long-context benchmarks using diverse set of models. With a custom CUDA kernel for scoring keys and a Flash Decode Triton backend for sparse attention, SOCKET achieves up to 1.5$\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention, making it an effective tool for long-context inference.

*Jorge L. Ruiz Williams*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了注意力稀疏性是学习到的拓扑性质而非架构约束，通过将注意力投影到"凝聚流形"上，实现了与全注意力的无损等价，从而获得极大加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战了注意力二次复杂度是智能基本需求的普遍观点，认为这是naive实现的结果，且稀疏模式是学习的拓扑性质而非人为限制。

Method: 通过对训练语言模型的实证分析，发现注意力质量集中在特定拓扑流形上，提出凝聚定理并使用Anchor + Window + Dynamic Top-k方法动态识别该流形。

Result: 在GPT-2、Pythia、Qwen2、TinyLlama和Mistral上实现与全O(n²)注意力的100%输出等价。硬件实现获得131K token时159倍加速（3.94ms vs 628ms），1M token时预计超1200倍加速，推理成本降低>99.9%。

Conclusion: 二次注意力瓶颈并非智能所必需，而是源于低效实现；注意力的学习拓扑结构可被利用以实现巨大的计算节省而不损失模型质量。

Abstract: We present the Condensate Theorem: attention sparsity is a learned topological property, not an architectural constraint. Through empirical analysis of trained language models, we find that attention mass concentrates on a distinct topological manifold -- and this manifold can be identified dynamically without checking every position. We prove a general result: for any query, projecting attention onto the Condensate Manifold (Anchor + Window + Dynamic Top-k) achieves 100% output equivalence with full $O(n^2)$ attention. This is not an approximation -- it is lossless parity. We validate this across GPT-2, Pythia, Qwen2, TinyLlama, and Mistral, demonstrating bit-exact token matching on 1,500+ generated tokens. By mapping this topology to hardware, our Topological Attention kernel achieves a 159x measured speedup at 131K tokens (3.94ms vs 628ms) and a projected >1,200x speedup at 1M tokens, reducing inference costs by >99.9% compared to Flash Attention. We conclude that the quadratic bottleneck is an artifact of naive implementation, not intelligence.

*Aoi Yoshimura,Gouhei Tanaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight online adaptation framework for reinforcement learning using Echo State Networks (ESNs) with Recursive Least Squares (RLS) to enable rapid adaptation in non-stationary environments without backpropagation or pretraining, significantly outperforming existing methods on robotic control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL policies trained in simulation suffer severe performance degradation in real-world due to non-stationary dynamics. Existing approaches like Domain Randomization and meta-RL require extensive pretraining, privileged information, or high computational costs, making them unsuitable for real-time and edge systems.

Method: Integrates an Echo State Network (ESN) as an adaptation module that encodes recent observation histories into latent context representation and updates its readout weights online using Recursive Least Squares (RLS), eliminating the need for backpropagation, pretraining, or privileged information.

Result: The method significantly outperforms Domain Randomization and other adaptive baselines under out-of-distribution dynamics, achieving stable adaptation within a few control steps and successfully handling intra-episode environment changes without policy reset on CartPole and HalfCheetah tasks.

Conclusion: The computationally efficient and stable framework provides a practical solution for online adaptation in non-stationary environments, making it well-suited for real-world robotic control and edge deployment where computational resources are limited.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies trained in simulation often suffer from severe performance degradation when deployed in real-world environments due to non-stationary dynamics. While Domain Randomization (DR) and meta-RL have been proposed to address this issue, they typically rely on extensive pretraining, privileged information, or high computational cost, limiting their applicability to real-time and edge systems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight online adaptation framework for RL based on Reservoir Computing. Specifically, we integrate an Echo State Networks (ESNs) as an adaptation module that encodes recent observation histories into a latent context representation, and update its readout weights online using Recursive Least Squares (RLS). This design enables rapid adaptation without backpropagation, pretraining, or access to privileged information. We evaluate the proposed method on CartPole and HalfCheetah tasks with severe and abrupt environment changes, including periodic external disturbances and extreme friction variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms DR and representative adaptive baselines under out-of-distribution dynamics, achieving stable adaptation within a few control steps. Notably, the method successfully handles intra-episode environment changes without resetting the policy. Due to its computational efficiency and stability, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for online adaptation in non-stationary environments and is well suited for real-world robotic control and edge deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出TFER框架解决OOD检测与机器遗忘之间的根本矛盾：将遗忘类转化为OOD样本，通过基于自由能原理的推拉机制，在精确遗忘目标类的同时保持模型对剩余类和OOD数据的判别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界部署可信AI需要同时满足两个矛盾需求：鲁棒的分布外检测确保系统安全，以及灵活的机器遗忘满足隐私合规和模型修正。传统遗忘方法会破坏OOD检测器依赖的静态紧凑数据流形结构，导致灾难性的异常判别能力丧失。

Method: 定义边界保持类遗忘问题，提出关键概念转变：有效遗忘在数学上等效于将目标类转化为OOD样本。基于自由能原理构建TFER框架，采用推拉博弈机制：通过拉机制将保留类锚定在低能量ID流形，通过自由能排斥力将遗忘类推至高能量OOD区域。通过参数高效微调实现，避免完全重训练的高成本。

Result: 在实现精确遗忘的同时，最大程度保留模型对剩余类和外部OOD数据的判别性能。更重要的是，TFER独特的推拉平衡赋予模型内在结构稳定性，能有效抵抗灾难性遗忘，无需复杂额外约束，在持续遗忘任务中展现卓越潜力。

Conclusion: TFER通过几何视角解决了OOD检测与机器遗忘的根本矛盾，将遗忘重新定义为流形边界变换问题。该框架不仅同时实现了两个目标，还提供了结构稳定性，为可信AI在开放环境中的部署提供了新范式。

Abstract: Deploying trustworthy AI in open-world environments faces a dual challenge: the necessity for robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to ensure system safety, and the demand for flexible machine unlearning to satisfy privacy compliance and model rectification. However, this objective encounters a fundamental geometric contradiction: current OOD detectors rely on a static and compact data manifold, whereas traditional classification-oriented unlearning methods disrupt this delicate structure, leading to a catastrophic loss of the model's capability to discriminate anomalies while erasing target classes. To resolve this dilemma, we first define the problem of boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a pivotal conceptual shift: in the context of OOD detection, effective unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming the target class into OOD samples. Based on this, we propose the TFER (Total Free Energy Repulsion) framework. Inspired by the free energy principle, TFER constructs a novel Push-Pull game mechanism: it anchors retained classes within a low-energy ID manifold through a pull mechanism, while actively expelling forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions using a free energy repulsion force. This approach is implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, circumventing the prohibitive cost of full retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximally preserving the model's discriminative performance on remaining classes and external OOD data. More importantly, our study reveals that the unique Push-Pull equilibrium of TFER endows the model with inherent structural stability, allowing it to effectively resist catastrophic forgetting without complex additional constraints, thereby demonstrating exceptional potential in continual unlearning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中学习者常面临仅能观测收益的bandit反馈和未知对手，传统外部遗憾在自博弈或全信息设定下有效，但在bandit设定下存在Ω(√T)下界。为突破此限制，需采用不同遗憾度量。

Method: 研究bandit反馈下零和博弈的对抗性学习，使用纯策略极大极小遗憾作为度量；分析无信息（仅收益）和有信息（收益+对手动作）两种bandit模型；对无信息设定提出Tsallis-INF算法；对有信息设定提出Maximin-UCB算法；将结果推广到大动作空间的线性博弈，提出Tsallis-FTRL-SPM和Maximin-LinUCB。

Result: Tsallis-INF在无信息正常形式博弈中实现O(c log T)的实例依赖遗憾界；信息论下界证明对博弈参数c的依赖是必需的；Maximin-UCB在有信息设定中实现O(c' log T)遗憾界，其中c'可能远小于c；两种结果推广至线性博弈，获得类似对数级遗憾界。

Conclusion: 通过引入新遗憾度量和设计相应算法，该研究成功突破了外部遗憾下界限制，在两种bandit反馈设定下均实现了对数级实例依赖遗憾界，且信息反馈设定可能带来更好的性能。

Abstract: Learning to play zero-sum games is a fundamental problem in game theory and machine learning. While significant progress has been made in minimizing external regret in the self-play settings or with full-information feedback, real-world applications often force learners to play against unknown, arbitrary opponents and restrict learners to bandit feedback where only the payoff of the realized action is observable. In such challenging settings, it is well-known that $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ external regret is unavoidable (where T is the number of rounds). To overcome this barrier, we investigate adversarial learning in zero-sum games under bandit feedback, aiming to minimize the deficit against the maximin pure strategy -- a metric we term Pure-Strategy Maximin Regret.
  We analyze this problem under two bandit feedback models: uninformed (only the realized reward is revealed) and informed (both the reward and the opponent's action are revealed). For uninformed bandit learning of normal-form games, we show that the Tsallis-INF algorithm achieves $O(c \log T)$ instance-dependent regret with a game-dependent parameter $c$. Crucially, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that the dependence on c is necessary. To overcome this hardness, we turn to the informed setting and introduce Maximin-UCB, which obtains another regret bound of the form $O(c' \log T)$ for a different game-dependent parameter $c'$ that could potentially be much smaller than $c$. Finally, we generalize both results to bilinear games over an arbitrary, large action set, proposing Tsallis-FTRL-SPM and Maximin-LinUCB for the uninformed and informed setting respectively and establishing similar game-dependent logarithmic regret bounds.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于标签分布学习的增强重用特征深度森林方法(ERDF)，通过利用标签相关性增强特征，并重用验证集上表现较差样本的特征，以提升模型性能和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标签分布学习需要利用标签相关性，深度森林在LDL领域研究不足，现有方法缺乏有效利用标签相关性的手段，因此需要新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出增强重用特征深度森林(ERDF)，包含两个机制：(1)利用标签相关性进行特征增强；(2)对验证集上表现比前一层差的样本进行测度感知的特征重用，形成增强-重用模式。

Result: 实验表明该方法在六个评价指标上优于其他对比算法。

Conclusion: ERDF成功地将标签相关性融入深度森林，通过增强-重用机制有效提升了LDL任务的性能和训练稳定性，具有竞争力。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) requires the learner to predict the degree of correlation between each sample and each label. To achieve this, a crucial task during learning is to leverage the correlation among labels. Deep Forest (DF) is a deep learning framework based on tree ensembles, whose training phase does not rely on backpropagation. DF performs in-model feature transform using the prediction of each layer and achieves competitive performance on many tasks. However, its exploration in the field of LDL is still in its infancy. The few existing methods that apply DF to the field of LDL do not have effective ways to utilize the correlation among labels. Therefore, we propose a method named Enhanced and Reused Feature Deep Forest (ERDF). It mainly contains two mechanisms: feature enhancement exploiting label correlation and measure-aware feature reuse. The first one is to utilize the correlation among labels to enhance the original features, enabling the samples to acquire more comprehensive information for the task of LDL. The second one performs a reuse operation on the features of samples that perform worse than the previous layer on the validation set, in order to ensure the stability of the training process. This kind of Enhance-Reuse pattern not only enables samples to enrich their features but also validates the effectiveness of their new features and conducts a reuse process to prevent the noise from spreading further. Experiments show that our method outperforms other comparison algorithms on six evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 大模型能生成丰富数据分布，但其对下游决策的支持效果未知，需建立适合的评估标准。

Method: 提出LLM-SAA方法，通过品类优化、定价和报童三大经典决策问题测试，分析LLM生成分布所诱导的决策效果及评估指标表现。

Result: LLM生成分布尤其在低数据环境下对决策具有实际效用；但Wasserstein距离等决策无关指标在评估时可能产生误导。

Conclusion: LLM-SAA在数据稀缺时有效，评估应采用决策导向指标而非单纯的分布距离度量。

Abstract: LLMs can generate a wealth of data, ranging from simulated personas imitating human valuations and preferences, to demand forecasts based on world knowledge. But how well do such LLM-generated distributions support downstream decision-making? For example, when pricing a new product, a firm could prompt an LLM to simulate how much consumers are willing to pay based on a product description, but how useful is the resulting distribution for optimizing the price? We refer to this approach as LLM-SAA, in which an LLM is used to construct an estimated distribution and the decision is then optimized under that distribution. In this paper, we study metrics to evaluate the quality of these LLM-generated distributions, based on the decisions they induce. Taking three canonical decision-making problems (assortment optimization, pricing, and newsvendor) as examples, we find that LLM-generated distributions are practically useful, especially in low-data regimes. We also show that decision-agnostic metrics such as Wasserstein distance can be misleading when evaluating these distributions for decision-making.

Abstract: Spectral gradient descent (SpecGD) orthogonalizes the matrix parameter updates and has inspired practical optimizers such as Muon. They often perform well in large language model (LLM) training, but their dynamics remain poorly understood. In the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) setting, where weight updates are parameterized as a product of two low-rank factors, we find a distinctive spectral phenomenon under Muon in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs: singular values of the LoRA product show near-uniform growth across the spectrum, despite orthogonalization being performed on the two factors separately. Motivated by this observation, we analyze spectral gradient flow (SpecGF)-a continuous-time analogue of SpecGD-in a simplified LoRA-style matrix factorization setting and prove "equal-rate" dynamics: all singular values grow at equal rates up to small deviations. Consequently, smaller singular values attain their target values earlier than larger ones, sharply contrasting with the largest-first stepwise learning observed in standard gradient flow. Moreover, we prove that SpecGF in our setting converges to global minima from almost all initializations, provided the factor norms remain bounded; with $\ell_2$ regularization, we obtain global convergence. Lastly, we corroborate our theory with experiments in the same setting.

Motivation: 合成表格数据的实际应用需要在分布保真度、下游任务效用和隐私保护三者间取得平衡，现有生成模型难以同时优化这三个目标

Method: 提出两阶段模型无关后处理框架：1)模式修补步修复缺失或严重欠表示的类别，同时保持依赖关系；2)k近邻过滤器替换与真实数据点过近的合成记录，强制实施最小距离。在三种公开数据集上对前馈生成器和VAE两种神经生成模型进行实例化和评估

Result: 在0.2-0.35的中等阈值下，该处理使真实与合成分类分布间的散度降低最多36%，成对依赖保持度提升10-14%，下游预测性能保持在未处理基线的约1%以内，基于距离的隐私指标得到改善，属性推理攻击成功率基本不变

Conclusion: 该后处理方法为提升合成表格数据质量和经验隐私提供了实用指导，在保持效用的同时可与提供正式差分隐私保证的方法形成互补

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data enables sharing and analysis of sensitive records, but its practical deployment requires balancing distributional fidelity, downstream utility, and privacy protection. We study a simple, model agnostic post processing framework that can be applied on top of any synthetic data generator to improve this trade off. First, a mode patching step repairs categories that are missing or severely underrepresented in the synthetic data, while largely preserving learned dependencies. Second, a k nearest neighbor filter replaces synthetic records that lie too close to real data points, enforcing a minimum distance between real and synthetic samples. We instantiate this framework for two neural generative models for tabular data, a feed forward generator and a variational autoencoder, and evaluate it on three public datasets covering credit card transactions, cardiovascular health, and census based income. We assess marginal and joint distributional similarity, the performance of models trained on synthetic data and evaluated on real data, and several empirical privacy indicators, including nearest neighbor distances and attribute inference attacks. With moderate thresholds between 0.2 and 0.35, the post processing reduces divergence between real and synthetic categorical distributions by up to 36 percent and improves a combined measure of pairwise dependence preservation by 10 to 14 percent, while keeping downstream predictive performance within about 1 percent of the unprocessed baseline. At the same time, distance based privacy indicators improve and the success rate of attribute inference attacks remains largely unchanged. These results provide practical guidance for selecting thresholds and applying post hoc repairs to improve the quality and empirical privacy of synthetic tabular data, while complementing approaches that provide formal differential privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based scientific agents have accelerated scientific discovery, yet they often suffer from significant inefficiencies due to adherence to fixed initial priors. Existing approaches predominantly operate within a static hypothesis space, which restricts the discovery of novel phenomena, resulting in computational waste when baseline theories fail. To address this, we propose shifting the focus from searching hypotheses to evolving the underlying scientific principles. We present PiEvo, a principle-evolvable framework that treats scientific discovery as Bayesian optimization over an expanding principle space. By integrating Information-Directed Hypothesis Selection via Gaussian Process and an anomaly-driven augmentation mechanism, PiEvo enables agents to autonomously refine their theoretical worldview. Evaluation across four benchmarks demonstrates that PiEvo (1) achieves an average solution quality of up to 90.81%~93.15%, representing a 29.7%~31.1% improvement over the state-of-the-art, (2) attains an 83.3% speedup in convergence step via significantly reduced sample complexity by optimizing the compact principle space, and (3) maintains robust performance across diverse scientific domains and LLM backbones.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper characterizes the minimax regret for distributed adversarial bandits as $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{(\rho^{-1/2}+K/N)T})$, where ρ is the communication spectral gap. Through a novel black-box reduction to delayed feedback bandits with gossip communication, it improves previous bounds, proves matching lower bounds, and extends to first-order, best-of-both-worlds, and distributed linear bandits settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed decision-making under partial information and communication constraints is fundamental for multi-agent systems and federated learning. The spectral gap of communication graphs fundamentally affects learning efficiency, yet precise regret bounds remain unknown. Understanding this tradeoff is crucial for designing efficient decentralized learning algorithms.

Method: The authors develop a black-box reduction framework that transforms distributed adversarial bandits into delayed feedback bandits. Agents communicate via gossip protocols, sharing information only with local neighbors. For linear bandits, they employ volumetric spanners to achieve O(d) communication cost per agent per round.

Result: Key results include: (1) Tight $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{(\rho^{-1/2}+K/N)T})$ minimax regret bound, improving over $\tilde{O}(\rho^{-1/3}(KT)^{2/3})$; (2) Lower bound showing decomposition into $\rho^{-1/4}\sqrt{T}$ communication cost and $\sqrt{KT/N}$ bandit cost; (3) First-order and best-of-both-worlds bounds; (4) For linear bandits: $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{(\rho^{-1/2}+1/N)dT})$ with O(d) communication.

Conclusion: This work provides a complete theoretical characterization of distributed adversarial bandits, establishing tight regret bounds and revealing the fundamental communication-bandit tradeoff. The versatile reduction framework yields state-of-the-art results across multiple settings, advancing the design of efficient distributed learning systems under communication constraints.

Abstract: We study distributed adversarial bandits, where $N$ agents cooperate to minimize the global average loss while observing only their own local losses. We show that the minimax regret for this problem is $\tildeΘ(\sqrt{(ρ^{-1/2}+K/N)T})$, where $T$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of actions, and $ρ$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix. Our algorithm, based on a novel black-box reduction to bandits with delayed feedback, requires agents to communicate only through gossip. It achieves an upper bound that significantly improves over the previous best bound $\tilde{O}(ρ^{-1/3}(KT)^{2/3})$ of Yi and Vojnovic (2023). We complement this result with a matching lower bound, showing that the problem's difficulty decomposes into a communication cost $ρ^{-1/4}\sqrt{T}$ and a bandit cost $\sqrt{KT/N}$. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by deriving first-order and best-of-both-worlds bounds in the distributed adversarial setting. Finally, we extend our framework to distributed linear bandits in $R^d$, obtaining a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{(ρ^{-1/2}+1/N)dT})$, achieved with only $O(d)$ communication cost per agent and per round via a volumetric spanner.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition plays a critical role in affective computing and emerging decision-support systems, yet remains challenging due to high-dimensional, noisy, and subject-dependent signals. This study investigates whether hybrid deep learning architectures that integrate convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based components can improve emotion classification performance and robustness in EEG data. We propose an enhanced hybrid model that combines convolutional feature extraction, bidirectional temporal modeling, and self-attention mechanisms with regularization strategies to mitigate overfitting. Experiments conducted on a publicly available EEG dataset spanning three emotional states (neutral, positive, and negative) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, significantly outperforming classical machine learning and neural baselines. Statistical tests confirm the robustness of these performance gains under cross-validation. Feature-level analyses further reveal that covariance-based EEG features contribute most strongly to emotion discrimination, highlighting the importance of inter-channel relationships in affective modeling. These findings suggest that carefully designed hybrid architectures can effectively balance predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in EEG-based emotion recognition, with implications for applied affective computing and human-centered intelligent systems.

Abstract: Tokenization is a promising path to multi-modal models capable of jointly understanding protein sequences, structure, and function. Existing protein structure tokenizers create tokens by pooling information from local neighborhoods, an approach that limits their performance on generative and representation tasks. In this work, we present a method for global tokenization of protein structures in which successive tokens contribute increasing levels of detail to a global representation. This change resolves several issues with generative models based on local protein tokenization: it mitigates error accumulation, provides embeddings without sequence-reduction operations, and allows task-specific adaptation of a tokenized sequence's information content. We validate our method on reconstruction, generative, and representation tasks and demonstrate that it matches or outperforms existing models based on local protein structure tokenizers. We show how adaptive tokens enable inference criteria based on information content, which boosts designability. We validate representations generated from our tokenizer on CATH classification tasks and demonstrate that non-linear probing on our tokenized sequences outperforms equivalent probing on representations from other tokenizers. Finally, we demonstrate how our method supports zero-shot protein shrinking and affinity maturation.

Abstract: Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are rising in popularity for all kinds of applications. To safely use CVNNs in practice, analyzing their robustness against outliers is crucial. One well known technique to understand the behavior of deep neural networks is to investigate their behavior under adversarial attacks, which can be seen as worst case minimal perturbations. We design Phase Attacks, a kind of attack specifically targeting the phase information of complex-valued inputs. Additionally, we derive complex-valued versions of commonly used adversarial attacks. We show that in some scenarios CVNNs are more robust than RVNNs and that both are very susceptible to phase changes with the Phase Attacks decreasing the model performance more, than equally strong regular attacks, which can attack both phase and magnitude.

*Jasper A. Vrugt,Jonathan M. Frame,Ethan Bollman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents an analytic framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling that computes exact parameter sensitivities by augmenting ODE systems with sensitivity equations, enabling fast and stable calibration without relying on automatic differentiation libraries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conceptual hydrologic models are crucial for rainfall-runoff modeling but suffer from slow and numerically fragile calibration. Existing gradient-based methods using finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (JAX, PyTorch, TensorFlow) are computationally expensive, introduce truncation errors and solver instabilities, and have substantial overhead, especially for ODE systems.

Method: The authors developed a fully analytic framework that augments the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations to jointly evolve model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters, providing analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function.

Result: The method eliminates step-size dependence and noise from numerical differentiation, avoids instability of adjoint methods and overhead of autodiff toolchains, and produces deterministic, physically interpretable gradients that work with various objective functions including classical residuals, hydrologic metrics (Nash-Sutcliffe, Kling-Gupta), robust losses, and hydrograph-based functionals.

Conclusion: This framework enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking the full potential of differentiable modeling without relying on external opaque CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries.

Abstract: Conceptual hydrologic models remain the cornerstone of rainfall-runoff modeling, yet their calibration is often slow and numerically fragile. Most gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow), which are computationally demanding and introduce truncation errors, solver instabilities, and substantial overhead. These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers. Overall, this work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking the full potential of differentiable modeling without reliance on external, opaque, or CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries.

*Christof Duhme,Florian Eilers,Xiaoyi Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了ℓp范数中参数p对对抗攻击稀疏性和平滑性的影响，发现p=1或p=2通常不是最优选择，而p∈[1.3,1.5]能在稀疏和平滑攻击之间取得最佳平衡，强调了在设计对抗攻击时需要原则性地选择范数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击研究大多随意选择ℓ₁、ℓ₂或ℓ∞范数，缺乏对p参数如何系统影响对抗扰动结构和感知特性的深入研究。作者希望填补这一空白，为对抗攻击的设计提供理论指导。

Method: 1) 研究p∈[1,2]范围内的ℓp范数约束；2) 采用两种文献中的稀疏性度量标准；3) 提出三种平滑性度量：基于平滑操作的通用框架、基于一阶泰勒近似的度量、以及一个额外平滑性度量；4) 在多个真实图像数据集和多种模型架构（CNN和Transformer）上进行全面实证评估。

Result: 1) ℓ₁和ℓ₂范数在大多数情况下并非最优；2) 最优p值取决于具体任务；3) p∈[1.3,1.5]的ℓp范数能在稀疏和平滑攻击之间取得最佳权衡；4) 验证了提出的平滑性度量框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击设计中原则性选择范数参数p至关重要，不应简单默认使用ℓ₁或ℓ₂。研究为理解和优化对抗样本的感知特性提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against deep neural networks are commonly constructed under $\ell_p$ norm constraints, most often using $p=1$, $p=2$ or $p=\infty$, and potentially regularized for specific demands such as sparsity or smoothness. These choices are typically made without a systematic investigation of how the norm parameter \( p \) influences the structural and perceptual properties of adversarial perturbations. In this work, we study how the choice of \( p \) affects sparsity and smoothness of adversarial attacks generated under \( \ell_p \) norm constraints for values of $p \in [1,2]$. To enable a quantitative analysis, we adopt two established sparsity measures from the literature and introduce three smoothness measures. In particular, we propose a general framework for deriving smoothness measures based on smoothing operations and additionally introduce a smoothness measure based on first-order Taylor approximations. Using these measures, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple real-world image datasets and a diverse set of model architectures, including both convolutional and transformer-based networks. We show that the choice of $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ is suboptimal in most cases and the optimal $p$ value is dependent on the specific task. In our experiments, using $\ell_p$ norms with $p\in [1.3, 1.5]$ yields the best trade-off between sparse and smooth attacks. These findings highlight the importance of principled norm selection when designing and evaluating adversarial attacks.

### [44] [Is Gradient Ascent Really Necessary? Memorize to Forget for Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06441)
*Zhuo Huang,Qizhou Wang,Ziming Hong,Shanshan Ye,Bo Han,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes model extrapolation as a stable alternative to gradient ascent for machine unlearning, avoiding catastrophic collapse by training a memorization model and extrapolating to obtain the forget model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine unlearning is critical for protecting sensitive/private/copyrighted knowledge in AI, but current gradient ascent methods cause catastrophic performance collapse on general tasks.

Method: The authors propose model extrapolation - first training a memorization model that learns undesired data while maintaining performance on retained data, then extrapolating from this memorization model back to the original reference model to obtain the forget model, using gradient descent instead of ascent.

Result: The approach successfully stabilizes machine unlearning, avoids catastrophic collapse, converges effectively throughout training, and achieves improved unlearning performance compared to gradient ascent methods.

Conclusion: Model extrapolation provides a simple, efficient, and stable solution for machine unlearning that effectively removes sensitive data influence without compromising overall model performance.

Abstract: For ethical and safe AI, machine unlearning rises as a critical topic aiming to protect sensitive, private, and copyrighted knowledge from misuse. To achieve this goal, it is common to conduct gradient ascent (GA) to reverse the training on undesired data. However, such a reversal is prone to catastrophic collapse, which leads to serious performance degradation in general tasks. As a solution, we propose model extrapolation as an alternative to GA, which reaches the counterpart direction in the hypothesis space from one model given another reference model. Therefore, we leverage the original model as the reference, further train it to memorize undesired data while keeping prediction consistency on the rest retained data, to obtain a memorization model. Counterfactual as it might sound, a forget model can be obtained via extrapolation from the memorization model to the reference model. Hence, we avoid directly acquiring the forget model using GA, but proceed with gradient descent for the memorization model, which successfully stabilizes the machine unlearning process. Our model extrapolation is simple and efficient to implement, and it can also effectively converge throughout training to achieve improved unlearning performance.

*Zhuo Huang,Runnan Chen,Bo Han,Gang Niu,Masashi Sugiyama,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BrokenBind 是一种新型多模态学习方法，能从不同数据集中绑定模态，通过生成伪嵌入实现未见模态的泛化，在低数据情况下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习方法受限于数据集中的模态，无法泛化到未见模态，且数据获取成本高，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出BrokenBind，利用多个数据集（包含目标模态和一个共享模态），通过生成伪嵌入来填补缺失模态，实现跨数据集模态绑定，支持任意两种模态的组合。

Result: 在低数据 regime 下有效，广泛评估证明其优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: BrokenBind 实现了灵活通用的多模态学习，突破了数据集限制，性能优越。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning combines various modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of real-world problems. A common strategy is to directly bind different modalities together in a specific joint embedding space. However, the capability of existing methods is restricted within the modalities presented in the given dataset, thus they are biased when generalizing to unpresented modalities in downstream tasks. As a result, due to such inflexibility, the viability of previous methods is seriously hindered by the cost of acquiring multi-modal datasets. In this paper, we introduce BrokenBind, which focuses on binding modalities that are presented from different datasets. To achieve this, BrokenBind simultaneously leverages multiple datasets containing the modalities of interest and one shared modality. Though the two datasets do not correspond to each other due to distribution mismatch, we can capture their relationship to generate pseudo embeddings to fill in the missing modalities of interest, enabling flexible and generalized multi-modal learning. Under our framework, any two modalities can be bound together, free from the dataset limitation, to achieve universal modality exploration. Further, to reveal the capability of our method, we study intensified scenarios where more than two datasets are needed for modality binding and show the effectiveness of BrokenBind in low-data regimes. Through extensive evaluation, we carefully justify the superiority of BrokenBind compared to well-known multi-modal baseline methods.

TL;DR: 针对GRPO训练稳定性瓶颈，本文提出概率冲突消解（PCR）框架，通过贝叶斯建模梯度随机性并采用不确定性感知软投影机制，实验证明其在推理任务上性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO面临推理可塑性与通用能力保留的权衡，根源在于梯度几何冲突导致破坏性干扰，而现有确定性投影方法忽略群梯度估计的固有随机性。

Method: 提出概率冲突消解（PCR）贝叶斯框架，将梯度建模为随机变量，通过不确定性感知的"软投影"动态仲裁冲突并优化信噪比。

Result: 大量实验表明，PCR显著平滑训练轨迹，并在多种推理任务上实现性能提升。

Conclusion: PCR通过概率建模梯度冲突，有效解决了GRPO训练稳定性问题，为平衡模型可塑性与稳定性提供了新方案。

Abstract: Training stability remains a critical bottleneck for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often manifesting as a trade-off between reasoning plasticity and general capability retention. We identify a root cause as the geometric conflict between plasticity and stability gradients, which leads to destructive interference. Crucially, we argue that deterministic projection methods are suboptimal for GRPO as they overlook the intrinsic stochasticity of group-based gradient estimates. To address this, we propose Probabilistic Conflict Resolution (PCR), a Bayesian framework that models gradients as random variables. PCR dynamically arbitrates conflicts via an uncertainty-aware ``soft projection'' mechanism, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCR significantly smooths the training trajectory and achieves superior performance in various reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出温度缩放攻击（TSA），在保持准确率的同时破坏联邦学习的置信度校准，导致关键任务系统风险增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键任务系统中，预测置信度是风险控制的重要信号；现有联邦学习攻击主要针对准确率或后门，忽略了置信度校准作为攻击目标。

Method: 在本地训练中注入温度缩放并结合学习率-温度耦合，使恶意更新表现出良性优化行为，逃避检测；提供非独立同分布下的收敛性分析。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，TSA使校准误差显著提升（如CIFAR-100上误差增加145%），准确率变化<2%；对鲁棒聚合和事后校准防御仍有效；案例分析显示在医疗和自动驾驶中可导致关键遗漏或误报增加高达7.2倍。

Conclusion: 置信度校准的完整性是联邦学习的关键攻击面，需在安全设计中予以重视。

Abstract: Predictive confidence serves as a foundational control signal in mission-critical systems, directly governing risk-aware logic such as escalation, abstention, and conservative fallback. While prior federated learning attacks predominantly target accuracy or implant backdoors, we identify confidence calibration as a distinct attack objective. We present the Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA), a training-time attack that degrades calibration while preserving accuracy. By injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training, malicious updates maintain benign-like optimization behavior, evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection. We provide a convergence analysis under non-IID settings, showing that this coupling preserves standard convergence bounds while systematically distorting confidence. Across three benchmarks, TSA substantially shifts calibration (e.g., 145% error increase on CIFAR-100) with <2 accuracy change, and remains effective under robust aggregation and post-hoc calibration defenses. Case studies further show that confidence manipulation can cause up to 7.2x increases in missed critical cases (healthcare) or false alarms (autonomous driving), even when accuracy is unchanged. Overall, our results establish calibration integrity as a critical attack surface in federated learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出"窗口困境"概念，指出传统概念漂移检测器所识别的漂移可能源于窗口划分而非数据生成过程的根本变化，并通过实验证明传统批量学习方法往往优于漂移感知方法，从而质疑漂移检测器在流分类中的实际价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念漂移检测器通过比较数据流的不同窗口来检测分布变化，但缺乏对"窗口划分是否真的能反映底层过程变化"的深入思考，且漂移验证在实际应用中难以实现，导致漂移检测问题本身可能是定义不清的。

Method: 首先通过示例说明"窗口困境"现象，然后系统性地将多种漂移检测器与替代性适应策略进行实证比较，从理论和实验两个层面论证漂移检测的局限性。

Result: 实证研究发现，传统批量学习技术在许多情况下比专门针对漂移设计的方法表现更好，这表明漂移检测器可能并未带来预期收益。

Conclusion: 概念漂移检测在实践中面临根本性挑战，其必要性受到质疑；研究者需要重新思考流分类中漂移检测器的角色和有效性。

Abstract: Non-stationarity of an underlying data generating process that leads to distributional changes over time is a key characteristic of Data Streams. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as Concept Drift, has been intensively studied, and Concept Drift Detectors have been established as a class of methods for detecting such changes (drifts). For the most part, Drift Detectors compare regions (windows) of the data stream and detect drift if those windows are sufficiently dissimilar.
  In this work, we introduce the Window Dilemma, an observation that perceived drift is a product of windowing and not necessarily the underlying data generating process. Additionally, we highlight that drift detection is ill-posed, primarily because verification of drift events are implausible in practice. We demonstrate these contributions first by an illustrative example, followed by empirical comparisons of drift detectors against a variety of alternative adaptation strategies. Our main finding is that traditional batch learning techniques often perform better than their drift-aware counterparts further bringing into question the purpose of detectors in Stream Classification.

Result: 在不条件生成和折叠类别条件生成任务中，SaDiT在计算速度和结构可行性方面均优于RFDiffusion和Proteina，能更好地捕捉复杂拓扑特征且具有高可设计性。

Conclusion: SaDiT为蛋白质骨架设计提供了一种高效的新框架，通过离散令牌化与缓存机制实现了生成速度与质量的显著提升。

Abstract: Generative models for de novo protein backbone design have achieved remarkable success in creating novel protein structures. However, these diffusion-based approaches remain computationally intensive and slower than desired for large-scale structural exploration. While recent efforts like Proteina have introduced flow-matching to improve sampling efficiency, the potential of tokenization for structural compression and acceleration remains largely unexplored in the protein domain. In this work, we present SaDiT, a novel framework that accelerates protein backbone generation by integrating SaProt Tokenization with a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. SaDiT leverages a discrete latent space to represent protein geometry, significantly reducing the complexity of the generation process while maintaining theoretical SE(3) equivalence. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce an IPA Token Cache mechanism that optimizes the Invariant Point Attention (IPA) layers by reusing computed token states during iterative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that SaDiT outperforms state-of-the-art models, including RFDiffusion and Proteina, in both computational speed and structural viability. We evaluate our model across unconditional backbone generation and fold-class conditional generation tasks, where SaDiT shows superior ability to capture complex topological features with high designability.

Motivation: Online bilevel optimization (OBO) is a powerful framework for machine learning problems, but the optimality of existing regret bounds remains unclear.

Method: For standard bilevel local regret: propose algorithm achieving Ω(1+V_T) regret with O(T log T) inner-level gradient evaluations and a single-loop variant. For window-averaged regret: design window-based algorithm capturing sublinear environmental variation.

Result: Established optimal regret bounds for both settings (Ω(1+V_T) and Ω(T/W^2)). Experiments validate theoretical findings and demonstrate practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms achieve optimal regret bounds with efficient computation, making them both theoretically sound and practically effective for online bilevel optimization problems.

Abstract: Online bilevel optimization (OBO) has emerged as a powerful framework for many machine learning problems. Prior works have developed several algorithms that minimize the standard bilevel local regret or the window-averaged bilevel local regret of the OBO problem, but the optimality of existing regret bounds remains unclear. In this work, we establish optimal regret bounds for both settings. For standard bilevel local regret, we propose an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret $Ω(1+V_T)$ with at most $O(T\log T)$ total inner-level gradient evaluations. We further develop a fully single-loop algorithm whose regret bound includes an additional gradient-variation terms. For the window-averaged bilevel local regret, we design an algorithm that captures sublinear environmental variation through a window-based analysis and achieves the optimal regret $Ω(T/W^2)$. Experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a difficulty-aware advantage scaling coefficient (inspired by Focal loss) for RLVR algorithms to address sampling bias. The lightweight modification down-weights updates on high-success prompts, improving pass@256 scores by 6-7% across GRPO, DAPO, and CISPO without increasing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR relies on group sampling for advantage estimation, but large groups are computationally infeasible, while small groups bias learning toward common trajectories and miss rare-correct solutions, concentrating probability on already likely modes.

Method: Derives theoretical analysis of probability that updates miss rare-correct modes as a function of group size, showing non-monotonic behavior, then proposes a Focal loss-inspired advantage scaling coefficient that down-weights high-success prompts.

Result: On Qwen2.5-7B, pass@256 improves from 64.1→70.3 (GRPO), 69.3→72.5 (DAPO), and 73.2→76.8 (CISPO), while preserving pass@1, without increasing group size or computational overhead.

Conclusion: The lightweight, difficulty-aware advantage scaling effectively addresses sampling bias in group-relative RLVR by focusing learning on hard examples, achieving significant performance gains across multiple algorithms and benchmarks with no additional computational cost.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is commonly based on group sampling to estimate advantages and stabilize policy updates. In practice, large group sizes are not feasible due to computational limits, which biases learning toward trajectories that are already likely. Smaller groups often miss rare-correct trajectories while still containing mixed rewards, concentrating probability on common solutions. We derive the probability that updates miss rare-correct modes as a function of group size, showing non-monotonic behavior, and characterize how updates redistribute mass within the correct set, revealing that unsampled-correct mass can shrink even as total correct mass grows. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a difficulty-aware advantage scaling coefficient, inspired by Focal loss, that down-weights updates on high-success prompts. The lightweight modification can be directly integrated into any group-relative RLVR algorithm such as GRPO, DAPO, and CISPO. On Qwen2.5-7B across in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, our method improves pass@256 from 64.1 $\rightarrow$ 70.3 (GRPO), 69.3 $\rightarrow$ 72.5 (DAPO), and 73.2 $\rightarrow$ 76.8 (CISPO), while preserving or improving pass@1, without increasing group size or computational cost.

Conclusion: GCCPO通过显式奖励推理过程，成功训练LLM掌握过程有效且反事实鲁棒的推理模式，提升了推理泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks with advances in reasoning capabilities. However, existing reward mechanisms remain tightly coupled to final correctness and pay little attention to the underlying reasoning process: trajectories with sound reasoning but wrong answers receive low credit, while lucky guesses with flawed logic may be highly rewarded, affecting reasoning generalization. From a causal perspective, we interpret multi-candidate reasoning for a fixed question as a family of counterfactual experiments with theoretical supports. Building on this, we propose Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization to explicitly train LLMs to learn generalizable reasoning patterns. It proposes an episodic causal counterfactual reward that jointly captures (i) robustness, encouraging the answer distribution induced by a reasoning step to remain stable under counterfactual perturbations; and (ii) effectiveness, enforcing sufficient variability so that the learned reasoning strategy can transfer across questions. We then construct token-level advantages from this reward and optimize the policy, encouraging LLMs to favor reasoning patterns that are process-valid and counterfactually robust. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate its advantages.

Conclusion: 针对多智能体问题的归纳偏置（如超图表示）比单纯增加数据量或参数量更关键，为协调复杂群体交互提供了高效表示框架

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a representative multi-agent coordination problem, where multiple agents are required to navigate to their respective goals without collisions. Solving MAPF optimally is known to be NP-hard, leading to the adoption of learning-based approaches to alleviate the online computational burden. Prevailing approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically constrained to pairwise message passing between agents. However, this limitation leads to suboptimal behaviours and critical issues, such as attention dilution, particularly in dense environments where group (i.e. beyond just two agents) coordination is most critical. Despite the importance of such higher-order interactions, existing approaches have not been able to fully explore them. To address this representational bottleneck, we introduce HMAGAT (Hypergraph Multi-Agent Attention Network), a novel architecture that leverages attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly capture group dynamics. Empirically, HMAGAT establishes a new state-of-the-art among learning-based MAPF solvers: e.g., despite having just 1M parameters and being trained on 100$\times$ less data, it outperforms the current SoTA 85M parameter model. Through detailed analysis of HMAGAT's attention values, we demonstrate how hypergraph representations mitigate the attention dilution inherent in GNNs and capture complex interactions where pairwise methods fail. Our results illustrate that appropriate inductive biases are often more critical than the training data size or sheer parameter count for multi-agent problems.

Conclusion: UATS通过不确定性感知的搜索策略，显著提升了PRM在分布外推理路径上的可靠性，为推理时计算扩展提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-time reasoning scaling has significantly advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving. A prevalent approach involves external search guided by Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, a fundamental limitation of this framework is the epistemic uncertainty of PRMs when evaluating reasoning paths that deviate from their training distribution. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of this challenge. We first provide empirical evidence that PRMs exhibit high uncertainty and unreliable scoring on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We then establish a theoretical framework proving that while standard search incurs linear regret accumulation, an uncertainty-aware strategy can achieve sublinear regret. Motivated by these findings, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Tree Search (UATS), a unified method that estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo Dropout and dynamically allocates compute budget using a reinforcement learning-based controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the impact of OOD errors.

### [55] [AEGIS: Adversarial Target-Guided Retention-Data-Free Robust Concept Erasure from Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06771)
*Fengpeng Li,Kemou Li,Qizhou Wang,Bo Han,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEGIS is a novel concept erasure framework for diffusion models that simultaneously improves both robustness (resistance to concept reactivation) and retention (preserving unrelated concepts) without requiring additional retention data, overcoming the trade-off present in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept erasure methods face a critical robustness-retention tradeoff: improving one typically degrades the other. Robustness requires models to resist erased concept reactivation under semantically related prompts, while retention ensures unrelated concepts remain intact for model utility. Both are essential for practical deployment but existing approaches cannot address them simultaneously.

Method: Adversarial Erasure with Gradient Informed Synergy (AEGIS), a retention-data-free framework that employs adversarial training combined with gradient information to synergistically enhance both robustness and retention.

Result: The abstract indicates that AEGIS successfully advances both robustness and retention simultaneously, though specific quantitative results are not provided in this excerpt.

Conclusion: AEGIS presents a novel approach that breaks the traditional trade-off between robustness and retention in concept erasure, offering a more effective solution for preventing diffusion models from generating harmful content while preserving overall model utility.

Abstract: Concept erasure helps stop diffusion models (DMs) from generating harmful content; but current methods face robustness retention trade off. Robustness means the model fine-tuned by concept erasure methods resists reactivation of erased concepts, even under semantically related prompts. Retention means unrelated concepts are preserved so the model's overall utility stays intact. Both are critical for concept erasure in practice, yet addressing them simultaneously is challenging, as existing works typically improve one factor while sacrificing the other. Prior work typically strengthens one while degrading the other, e.g., mapping a single erased prompt to a fixed safe target leaves class level remnants exploitable by prompt attacks, whereas retention-oriented schemes underperform against adaptive adversaries. This paper introduces Adversarial Erasure with Gradient Informed Synergy (AEGIS), a retention-data-free framework that advances both robustness and retention.

Conclusion: 配置空间的进化生成范式有效解决了传统方法在灵活性、鲁棒性方面的缺陷，为自动化构建高性能多智能体系统提供了新方向

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) show strong promise for complex reasoning, planning, and tool-augmented tasks, but designing effective MAS architectures remains labor-intensive, brittle, and hard to generalize. Existing automatic MAS generation methods either rely on code generation, which often leads to executability and robustness failures, or impose rigid architectural templates that limit expressiveness and adaptability. We propose Evolutionary Generation of Multi-Agent Systems (EvoMAS), which formulates MAS generation as structured configuration generation. EvoMAS performs evolutionary generation in configuration space. Specifically, EvoMAS selects initial configurations from a pool, applies feedback-conditioned mutation and crossover guided by execution traces, and iteratively refines both the candidate pool and an experience memory. We evaluate EvoMAS on diverse benchmarks, including BBEH, SWE-Bench, and WorkBench, covering reasoning, software engineering, and tool-use tasks. EvoMAS consistently improves task performance over both human-designed MAS and prior automatic MAS generation methods, while producing generated systems with higher executability and runtime robustness. EvoMAS outperforms the agent evolution method EvoAgent by +10.5 points on BBEH reasoning and +7.1 points on WorkBench. With Claude-4.5-Sonnet, EvoMAS also reaches 79.1% on SWE-Bench-Verified, matching the top of the leaderboard.

TL;DR: 该研究证明激活引导向量在一般情况下根本不可识别，存在大量行为等效的干预，但在特定结构假设下可恢复可识别性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活引导方法被广泛用于控制大模型行为并被视为揭示内部表征，但其所依赖的"可识别性"假设缺乏严格理论验证。

Method: 理论证明结合实证验证：将引导形式化为对内部表征的干预，证明非可识别性；在多个模型和语义特征上测试正交扰动的等效性。

Result: 1) 引导向量因存在大量行为不可区分的等效干预类别而根本非可识别；2) 正交扰动能达到接近等效的效果且效应量可忽略；3) 在统计独立、稀疏约束、多环境验证或跨层一致性等结构假设下可恢复可识别性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了可解释性的根本限制，阐明了实现安全可靠的安全关键控制所必须依赖的结构性假设，对激活引导方法的理论基础和实际应用提出了重要警示。

Abstract: Activation steering methods, such as persona vectors, are widely used to control large language model behavior and increasingly interpreted as revealing meaningful internal representations. This interpretation implicitly assumes steering directions are identifiable and uniquely recoverable from input-output behavior. We formalize steering as an intervention on internal representations and prove that, under realistic modeling and data conditions, steering vectors are fundamentally non-identifiable due to large equivalence classes of behaviorally indistinguishable interventions. Empirically, we validate this across multiple models and semantic traits, showing orthogonal perturbations achieve near-equivalent efficacy with negligible effect sizes. However, identifiability is recoverable under structural assumptions including statistical independence, sparsity constraints, multi-environment validation or cross-layer consistency. These findings reveal fundamental interpretability limits and clarify structural assumptions required for reliable safety-critical control.

Abstract: Deep knowledge tracing models have achieved significant breakthroughs in modeling student learning trajectories. However, these architectures require substantial training time and are prone to overfitting on datasets with short sequences. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for knowledge tracing by leveraging tabular foundation models (TFMs). Unlike traditional methods that require offline training on a fixed training set, our approach performs real-time ''live'' knowledge tracing in an online way. The core of our method lies in a two-way attention mechanism: while attention knowledge tracing models only attend across earlier time steps, TFMs simultaneously attend across both time steps and interactions of other students in the training set. They align testing sequences with relevant training sequences at inference time, therefore skipping the training step entirely. We demonstrate, using several datasets of increasing size, that our method achieves competitive predictive performance with up to 273x speedups, in a setting where more student interactions are observed over time.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了无监督条件下从噪声中分离任务相关特征的挑战，为数据稀缺领域的特征学习提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Generalizing from limited data is particularly critical for models in domains such as material science, where task-relevant features in experimental datasets are often heavily confounded by measurement noise and experimental artifacts. Standard regularization techniques fail to precisely separate meaningful features from noise, while existing adversarial adaptation methods are limited by their reliance on explicit separation labels. To address this challenge, we propose the Adversarial Information Separation Framework (AdverISF), which isolates task-relevant features from noise without requiring explicit supervision. AdverISF introduces a self-supervised adversarial mechanism to enforce statistical independence between task-relevant features and noise representations. It further employs a multi-layer separation architecture that progressively recycles noise information across feature hierarchies to recover features inadvertently discarded as noise, thereby enabling finer-grained feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdverISF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in data-scarce scenarios. In addition, evaluations on real-world material design tasks show that it achieves superior generalization performance.

TL;DR: GAD-MoRE is a novel zero-shot graph anomaly detection framework that uses a Mixture of Riemannian Experts architecture with multiple curvature spaces to handle geometric differences across anomaly patterns, significantly outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot GAD methods ignore intrinsic geometric differences across diverse anomaly patterns, and using a single static curvature space distorts structural signatures of anomalies, substantially limiting cross-domain generalization.

Method: Proposes GAD-MoRE with three key components: (1) specialized Riemannian expert networks operating in distinct curvature spaces, (2) an anomaly-aware multi-curvature feature alignment module projecting inputs into parallel Riemannian spaces, and (3) a memory-based dynamic router that adaptively assigns inputs to experts based on historical reconstruction performance.

Result: Extensive zero-shot experiments show GAD-MoRE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generalist GAD baselines and even surpasses strong few-shot fine-tuned competitors with labeled target domain data.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses geometric diversity challenges in graph anomaly detection by leveraging multiple Riemannian spaces, demonstrating superior zero-shot generalization capabilities without requiring target domain labels.

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify irregular patterns in graph data, and recent works have explored zero-shot generalist GAD to enable generalization to unseen graph datasets. However, existing zero-shot GAD methods largely ignore intrinsic geometric differences across diverse anomaly patterns, substantially limiting their cross-domain generalization. In this work, we reveal that anomaly detectability is highly dependent on the underlying geometric properties and that embedding graphs from different domains into a single static curvature space can distort the structural signatures of anomalies. To address the challenge that a single curvature space cannot capture geometry-dependent graph anomaly patterns, we propose GAD-MoRE, a novel framework for zero-shot Generalizable Graph Anomaly Detection with a Mixture of Riemannian Experts architecture. Specifically, to ensure that each anomaly pattern is modeled in the Riemannian space where it is most detectable, GAD-MoRE employs a set of specialized Riemannian expert networks, each operating in a distinct curvature space. To align raw node features with curvature-specific anomaly characteristics, we introduce an anomaly-aware multi-curvature feature alignment module that projects inputs into parallel Riemannian spaces, enabling the capture of diverse geometric characteristics. Finally, to facilitate better generalization beyond seen patterns, we design a memory-based dynamic router that adaptively assigns each input to the most compatible expert based on historical reconstruction performance on similar anomalies. Extensive experiments in the zero-shot setting demonstrate that GAD-MoRE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generalist GAD baselines, and even surpasses strong competitors that are few-shot fine-tuned with labeled data from the target domain.

Motivation: BOED需要最大化期望信息增益(EIG)，但许多实际场景中似然函数难以计算。虽然模拟推理(SBI)为此提供了工具，但现有研究仅局限于单一的对比EIG边界，限制了方法性能和应用范围。

Method: 1. 识别EIG的多种可直接利用现代SBI密度估计器(神经后验、似然和比率估计)的表达形式；2. 提出基于神经似然估计的新EIG估计量；3. 针对梯度基EIG最大化的优化瓶颈，采用简单多起点并行梯度上升法提升可靠性和性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用EIG的多重SBI兼容形式和优化改进，该方法在BOED任务中实现了显著更好的性能和可靠性，为处理复杂实验设计问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) seeks to maximize the expected information gain (EIG) of experiments. This requires a likelihood estimate, which in many settings is intractable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) provides powerful tools for this regime. However, existing work explicitly connecting SBI and BOED is restricted to a single contrastive EIG bound. We show that the EIG admits multiple formulations which can directly leverage modern SBI density estimators, encompassing neural posterior, likelihood, and ratio estimation. Building on this perspective, we define a novel EIG estimator using neural likelihood estimation. Further, we identify optimization as a key bottleneck of gradient based EIG maximization and show that a simple multi-start parallel gradient ascent procedure can substantially improve reliability and performance. With these innovations, our SBI-based BOED methods are able to match or outperform by up to $22\%$ existing state-of-the-art approaches across standard BOED benchmarks.

TL;DR: 通过引入三个最小化归纳偏置（空间平滑性、稳定性和时间局部性），通用Transformer能够超越单纯预测，学习到开普勒轨道模型和牛顿力学等物理规律，实现了从曲线拟合到物理发现的跨越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨通用AI架构是否能超越预测功能，发现宇宙物理规律；揭示真正智能需要“世界模型”——既能预测未来状态又能理解底层动力学机制的因果抽象。

Method: 系统引入三个最小归纳偏置：1) 空间平滑性（通过连续回归建模）；2) 稳定性（通过噪声上下文训练减轻误差累积）；3) 时间局部性（限制注意力窗口为近期历史，强制模型依赖局部状态而非完整历史）。

Result: 前两个偏置使Transformer成功学习开普勒轨道模型，能拟合行星轨迹椭圆；加入时间局部性后，模型放弃曲线拟合，转而发现牛顿力作用表示，实现了真正的物理解释。

Conclusion: 简单的架构选择决定了AI成为“曲线拟合者”还是“物理学家”，这一发现是迈向自动化科学发现的关键一步。

Abstract: Can general-purpose AI architectures go beyond prediction to discover the physical laws governing the universe? True intelligence relies on "world models" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous "AI Physicist" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively "bake in" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations. Our results demonstrate that simple architectural choices determine whether an AI becomes a curve-fitter or a physicist, marking a critical step toward automated scientific discovery.

### [63] [Cochain Perspectives on Temporal-Difference Signals for Learning Beyond Markov Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06939)
*Zuyuan Zhang,Sizhe Tang,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a topological perspective on reinforcement learning, viewing TD errors as 1-cochains and Markov dynamics as topological integrability. It proposes HodgeFlow Policy Search (HFPS) that uses Hodge decomposition to separate Bellman-approximable components from topological residuals, achieving theoretical guarantees and improved performance in non-Markovian environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments exhibit non-Markovian dynamics with memory effects, making the Bellman equation only approximately valid. Existing RL algorithms lack theoretical understanding of what dynamics can be captured by the Bellman framework and how to optimally approximate them.

Method: The authors present a topological viewpoint where TD errors are 1-cochains and Markov dynamics represent topological integrability. They develop a Hodge-type decomposition using Bellman-de Rham projection to separate TD errors into integrable and residual components, then propose HFPS that fits a potential network to minimize the non-integrable residual.

Result: The proposed HFPS method provides stability/sensitivity guarantees and significantly improves RL performance in non-Markovian environments according to numerical evaluations.

Conclusion: This topological framework offers a theoretical foundation for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics in RL, enabling more robust algorithms with provable properties.

Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics are commonly found in real-world environments due to long-range dependencies, partial observability, and memory effects. The Bellman equation that is the central pillar of Reinforcement learning (RL) becomes only approximately valid under Non-Markovian. Existing work often focus on practical algorithm designs and offer limited theoretical treatment to address key questions, such as what dynamics are indeed capturable by the Bellman framework and how to inspire new algorithm classes with optimal approximations. In this paper, we present a novel topological viewpoint on temporal-difference (TD) based RL. We show that TD errors can be viewed as 1-cochain in the topological space of state transitions, while Markov dynamics are then interpreted as topological integrability. This novel view enables us to obtain a Hodge-type decomposition of TD errors into an integrable component and a topological residual, through a Bellman-de Rham projection. We further propose HodgeFlow Policy Search (HFPS) by fitting a potential network to minimize the non-integrable projection residual in RL, achieving stability/sensitivity guarantees. In numerical evaluations, HFPS is shown to significantly improve RL performance under non-Markovian.

*Giovanni Montanari,Côme Fiegel,Corentin Pla,Aadirupa Saha,Vianney Perchet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies online resource allocation with censored feedback, where rewards depend on unknown arm activation probabilities and budget thresholds. The authors prove a T^(1/3) regret lower bound and propose two optimistic algorithms (RA-UCB for known budgets, MG-UCB for unknown budgets) achieving Õ(√T) regret, matching the lower bound's order up to log factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online resource allocation under censored feedback models critical real-world problems like online advertising and healthcare where we only observe success if a hidden threshold is met. The challenge lies in simultaneously learning unknown activation probabilities and budget thresholds while balancing exploration-exploitation over a finite horizon.

Method: The authors develop two optimism-based algorithms: RA-UCB leverages parameter estimation and confidence bounds for settings with known budgets, while MG-UCB incorporates within-round switching and infinitesimal allocations for unknown, round-dependent budgets. Both use upper confidence bounds to guide the exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Result: (1) Proves an information-theoretic regret lower bound of Ω(T^(1/3)), establishing problem hardness. (2) RA-UCB achieves Õ(√T) regret for known budgets and O(poly-log T) under stronger assumptions. (3) MG-UCB matches these guarantees for unknown budgets. (4) Empirical validation on real-world datasets confirms theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The paper successfully tackles the challenging censored feedback problem with theoretically grounded algorithms that achieve near-optimal regret bounds (matching √T up to log factors) for both known and unknown budget scenarios, demonstrating practical relevance through real data experiments.

Abstract: We study the online resource allocation problem in which at each round, a budget $B$ must be allocated across $K$ arms under censored feedback. An arm yields a reward if and only if two conditions are satisfied: (i) the arm is activated according to an arm-specific Bernoulli random variable with unknown parameter, and (ii) the allocated budget exceeds a random threshold drawn from a parametric distribution with unknown parameter. Over $T$ rounds, the learner must jointly estimate the unknown parameters and allocate the budget so as to maximize cumulative reward facing the exploration--exploitation trade-off. We prove an information-theoretic regret lower bound $Ω(T^{1/3})$, demonstrating the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. We then propose RA-UCB, an optimistic algorithm that leverages non-trivial parameter estimation and confidence bounds. When the budget $B$ is known at the beginning of each round, RA-UCB achieves a regret of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$, and even $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}\text{-}\log T)$ under stronger assumptions. As for unknown, round dependent budget, we introduce MG-UCB, which allows within-round switching and infinitesimal allocations, and matches the regret guarantees of RA-UCB. We then validate our theoretical results through experiments on real-world datasets.

Result: Llama-3.3-70B表现出显著ESR现象，较小模型(Llama-3、Gemma-2系列)出现频率较低；识别出26个与ESR因果相关的SAE潜在单元；零消融这些单元使多重尝试率降低25%；元提示使Llama-3.3-70B的多重尝试率提升4倍；微调可使较小模型产生类ESR行为。

Conclusion: ESR具有双重影响：既可能保护模型免受对抗操纵，也可能干扰有益的安全干预。理解和控制这些抵抗机制对于开发透明、可控的AI系统至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models can resist task-misaligned activation steering during inference, sometimes recovering mid-generation to produce improved responses even when steering remains active. We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR). Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activations, we find that Llama-3.3-70B shows substantial ESR, while smaller models from the Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families exhibit the phenomenon less frequently. We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B. Zero-ablating these latents reduces the multi-attempt rate by 25%, providing causal evidence for dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits. We demonstrate that ESR can be deliberately enhanced through both prompting and training: meta-prompts instructing the model to self-monitor increase the multi-attempt rate by 4x for Llama-3.3-70B, and fine-tuning on self-correction examples successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models. These findings have dual implications: ESR could protect against adversarial manipulation but might also interfere with beneficial safety interventions that rely on activation steering. Understanding and controlling these resistance mechanisms is important for developing transparent and controllable AI systems.

Conclusion: 集中学习与持续学习的特征几何结构存在本质差异，各向同性不适合作为非平稳持续学习场景的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Centralized training is the standard paradigm in deep learning, enabling models to learn from a unified dataset in a single location. In such setup, isotropic feature distributions naturally arise as a mean to support well-structured and generalizable representations. In contrast, continual learning operates on streaming and non-stationary data, and trains models incrementally, inherently facing the well-known plasticity-stability dilemma. In such settings, learning dynamics tends to yield increasingly anisotropic feature space. This arises a fundamental question: should isotropy be enforced to achieve a better balance between stability and plasticity, and thereby mitigate catastrophic forgetting? In this paper, we investigate whether promoting feature-space isotropy can enhance representation quality in continual learning. Through experiments using contrastive continual learning techniques on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data, we find that isotropic regularization fails to improve, and can in fact degrade, model accuracy in continual settings. Our results highlight essential differences in feature geometry between centralized and continual learning, suggesting that isotropy, while beneficial in centralized setups, may not constitute an appropriate inductive bias for non-stationary learning scenarios.

Conclusion: DiTS作为一种通用架构，通过有效建模多维依赖关系，为时间序列概率预测提供了更强大灵活的解决方案，证明了生成式方法在时间序列预测中的独特优势。

Abstract: While generative modeling on time series facilitates more capable and flexible probabilistic forecasting, existing generative time series models do not address the multi-dimensional properties of time series data well. The prevalent architecture of Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which relies on simplistic conditioning controls and a single-stream Transformer backbone, tends to underutilize cross-variate dependencies in covariate-aware forecasting. Inspired by Multimodal Diffusion Transformers that integrate textual guidance into video generation, we propose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series (DiTS), a general-purpose architecture that frames endogenous and exogenous variates as distinct modalities. To better capture both inter-variate and intra-variate dependencies, we design a dual-stream Transformer block tailored for time-series data, comprising a Time Attention module for autoregressive modeling along the temporal dimension and a Variate Attention module for cross-variate modeling. Unlike the common approach for images, which flattens 2D token grids into 1D sequences, our design leverages the low-rank property inherent in multivariate dependencies, thereby reducing computational costs. Experiments show that DiTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, regardless of the presence of future exogenous variate observations, demonstrating unique generative forecasting strengths over traditional deterministic deep forecasting models.

TL;DR: Temporal resampling in healthcare offline reinforcement learning causes significant performance degradation through three failure mechanisms, which standard evaluation metrics fail to detect, revealing fundamental risks in current pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline reinforcement learning shows promise for healthcare, but current research aggregates patient data into fixed time intervals without understanding how these temporal manipulations impact model safety and efficacy.

Method: Used a gridworld navigation task and UVA/Padova diabetes simulator to demonstrate that temporal resampling degrades ORL performance during live deployment, identifying three failure mechanisms: counterfactual trajectories, temporal expectation distortion, and error compounding.

Result: Temporal resampling significantly degrades ORL performance in live deployment, and standard off-policy evaluation metrics fail to detect these performance drops.

Conclusion: Current healthcare ORL pipelines face fundamental risks from temporal manipulations; methods that explicitly handle irregular clinical decision-making timing are needed.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (ORL) has shown potential for improving decision-making in healthcare. However, contemporary research typically aggregates patient data into fixed time intervals, simplifying their mapping to standard ORL frameworks. The impact of these temporal manipulations on model safety and efficacy remains poorly understood. In this work, using both a gridworld navigation task and the UVA/Padova clinical diabetes simulator, we demonstrate that temporal resampling significantly degrades the performance of offline reinforcement learning algorithms during live deployment. We propose three mechanisms that drive this failure: (i) the generation of counterfactual trajectories, (ii) the distortion of temporal expectations, and (iii) the compounding of generalisation errors. Crucially, we find that standard off-policy evaluation metrics can fail to detect these drops in performance. Our findings reveal a fundamental risk in current healthcare ORL pipelines and emphasise the need for methods that explicitly handle the irregular timing of clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive-CaRe正则化策略，通过惩罚统计贡献与因果贡献的差异，在医疗结果预测中平衡预测准确性与因果鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习追求预测准确性但易捕获伪相关，因果结构学习方法又过于保守损失诊断精度，需要平衡预测价值与因果鲁棒性

Method: 提出模型无关的正则化策略Adaptive-CaRe，加入与输入特征统计贡献和因果贡献差异成比例的惩罚项

Result: 合成数据实验证明该方法能找到鲁棒预测因子并保持竞争力准确率；通过调节正则化强度λ实现精度-鲁棒性权衡；真实世界数据验证了实用性

Conclusion: Adaptive-CaRe为医疗领域中预测准确性与因果鲁棒性的长期权衡问题提供了简单有效的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate prediction of outcomes is crucial for clinical decision-making and personalized patient care. Supervised machine learning algorithms, which are commonly used for outcome prediction in the medical domain, optimize for predictive accuracy, which can result in models latching onto spurious correlations instead of robust predictors. Causal structure learning methods on the other hand have the potential to provide robust predictors for the target, but can be too conservative because of algorithmic and data assumptions, resulting in loss of diagnostic precision. Therefore, we propose a novel model-agnostic regularization strategy, Adaptive-CaRe, for generalized outcome prediction in the medical domain. Adaptive-CaRe strikes a balance between both predictive value and causal robustness by incorporating a penalty that is proportional to the difference between the estimated statistical contribution and estimated causal contribution of the input features for model predictions. Our experiments on synthetic data establish the efficacy of the proposed Adaptive-CaRe regularizer in finding robust predictors for the target while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. With experiments on a standard causal benchmark, we provide a blueprint for navigating the trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness by tweaking the regularization strength, $λ$. Validation using real-world dataset confirms that the results translate to practical, real-domain settings. Therefore, Adaptive-CaRe provides a simple yet effective solution to the long-standing trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness in the medical domain. Future work would involve studying alternate causal structure learning frameworks and complex classification models to provide deeper insights at a larger scale.

TL;DR: 提出记忆增强型扩散/流匹配PDE求解器，通过Mori-Zwanzig理论揭示记忆缺失的结构性局限，引入紧凑在线状态提升长时程预测稳定性，在可压缩流和多尺度混合问题中显著改善精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归PDE求解器在粗到细尺度再生过程中存在长时程漂移问题，尤其当每一步需重新生成未解析细尺度时。扩散/流匹配生成器虽具马尔可夫内部动态，但稳定性受每步条件律误差制约。

Conclusion: 记忆机制通过结构化条件先验有效缓解未解析尺度建模问题，从理论上和实验上验证了记忆增强生成模型在解决长时程PDE求解漂移问题上的优越性，为多尺度动力学模拟提供新范式。

Abstract: Autoregressive generative PDE solvers can be accurate one step ahead yet drift over long rollouts, especially in coarse-to-fine regimes where each step must regenerate unresolved fine scales. This is the regime of diffusion and flow-matching generators: although their internal dynamics are Markovian, rollout stability is governed by per-step \emph{conditional law} errors. Using the Mori--Zwanzig projection formalism, we show that eliminating unresolved variables yields an exact resolved evolution with a Markov term, a memory term, and an orthogonal forcing, exposing a structural limitation of memoryless closures. Motivated by this, we introduce memory-conditioned diffusion/flow-matching with a compact online state injected into denoising via latent features. Via disintegration, memory induces a structured conditional tail prior for unresolved scales and reduces the transport needed to populate missing frequencies. We prove Wasserstein stability of the resulting conditional kernel. We then derive discrete Grönwall rollout bounds that separate memory approximation from conditional generation error. Experiments on compressible flows with shocks and multiscale mixing show improved accuracy and markedly more stable long-horizon rollouts, with better fine-scale spectral and statistical fidelity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NanoQuant是首个后训练量化方法，可将大语言模型压缩至二进制和亚1-bit水平。该方法通过低秩二值因子分解、ADMM初始化和重建微调，在保持SOTA精度的同时实现25.8倍压缩，使700亿参数模型可在8GB消费级GPU上运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有权重量化方法无法高效将大语言模型压缩至二进制(1-bit)水平，需要大量数据和计算资源或额外存储空间，限制了超大模型在消费级硬件上的部署。

Method: 将量化建模为低秩二值因子分解问题，利用ADMM高效初始化二值矩阵和缩放因子，再通过分块和模型重建过程微调参数。

Result: 建立低内存后训练量化新Pareto前沿，在亚1-bit压缩率下实现SOTA精度。单块H100仅需13小时即可将Llama2-70B压缩25.8倍，使700亿参数模型可在8GB消费级GPU上运行。

Conclusion: NanoQuant成功解决了大语言模型极致量化的技术难题，为在消费级硬件上部署超大规模模型提供了可行方案，显著降低了部署门槛和成本。

Abstract: Weight-only quantization has become a standard approach for efficiently serving large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to efficiently compress models to binary (1-bit) levels, as they either require large amounts of data and compute or incur additional storage. In this work, we propose NanoQuant, the first post-training quantization (PTQ) method to compress LLMs to both binary and sub-1-bit levels. NanoQuant formulates quantization as a low-rank binary factorization problem, and compresses full-precision weights to low-rank binary matrices and scales. Specifically, it utilizes an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to precisely initialize latent binary matrices and scales, and then tune the initialized parameters through a block and model reconstruction process. Consequently, NanoQuant establishes a new Pareto frontier in low-memory post-training quantization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even at sub-1-bit compression rates. NanoQuant makes large-scale deployment feasible on consumer hardware. For example, it compresses Llama2-70B by 25.8$\times$ in just 13 hours on a single H100, enabling a 70B model to operate on a consumer 8 GB GPU.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过归纳偏置视角探究transformer中的grokking现象，发现LayerNorm位置和优化设置会调节grokking速度，特征在整个训练过程中持续演化，而非简单的lazy-to-rich转变，泛化与特征可压缩性可预测地相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过归纳偏置（架构或优化带来的偏好）来理解transformer中的grokking现象，探究架构选择和优化设置如何影响学习动力学和泛化，并澄清先前提出的控制因素（如readout scale）中的混杂因素。

Method: 作者系统分析了transformer架构（特别是Layer Normalization的位置）和各种优化设置。通过研究shortcut-learning行为、注意力熵、特征演化模式和压缩性指标来揭示机制。

Result: 1) LayerNorm位置通过shortcut-learning和注意力熵强烈调节grokking速度；2) readout scale效应受学习率和权重衰减的干扰；3) 特征在整个训练中持续演化，表明grokking比简单的lazy-to-rich转变更复杂；4) 泛化与特征可压缩性可预测地出现。

Conclusion: Transformer中的grokking主要由归纳偏置驱动，可理解为特征持续演化最终形成可压缩解的过程，而非二元状态转变，这为理解泛化动力学提供了更细致的框架。

Abstract: We investigate grokking in transformers through the lens of inductive bias: dispositions arising from architecture or optimization that let the network prefer one solution over another. We first show that architectural choices such as the position of Layer Normalization (LN) strongly modulates grokking speed. This modulation is explained by isolating how LN on specific pathways shapes shortcut-learning and attention entropy. Subsequently, we study how different optimization settings modulate grokking, inducing distinct interpretations of previously proposed controls such as readout scale. Particularly, we find that using readout scale as a control for lazy training can be confounded by learning rate and weight decay in our setting. Accordingly, we show that features evolve continuously throughout training, suggesting grokking in transformers can be more nuanced than a lazy-to-rich transition of the learning regime. Finally, we show how generalization predictably emerges with feature compressibility in grokking, across different modulators of inductive bias. Our code is released at https://tinyurl.com/y52u3cad.

Conclusion: 该算法通过软前向后向框架与零阶搜索的结合，有效解决了广义效用函数的优化问题，显著扩展了零样本强化学习在离线数据中提取多样化行为的适用范围。

Abstract: Recent advancements in zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) have facilitated the extraction of diverse behaviors from unlabeled, offline data sources. In particular, forward-backward algorithms (FB) can retrieve a family of policies that can approximately solve any standard RL problem (with additive rewards, linear in the occupancy measure), given sufficient capacity. While retaining zero-shot properties, we tackle the greater problem class of RL with general utilities, in which the objective is an arbitrary differentiable function of the occupancy measure. This setting is strictly more expressive, capturing tasks such as distribution matching or pure exploration, which may not be reduced to additive rewards. We show that this additional complexity can be captured by a novel, maximum entropy (soft) variant of the forward-backward algorithm, which recovers a family of stochastic policies from offline data. When coupled with zero-order search over compact policy embeddings, this algorithm can sidestep iterative optimization schemes, and optimizes general utilities directly at test-time. Across both didactic and high-dimensional experiments, we demonstrate that our method retains favorable properties of FB algorithms, while also extending their range to more general RL problems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multicalibration gradient boosting has recently emerged as a scalable method that empirically produces approximately multicalibrated predictors and has been deployed at web scale. Despite this empirical success, its convergence properties are not well understood. In this paper, we bridge the gap by providing convergence guarantees for multicalibration gradient boosting in regression with squared-error loss. We show that the magnitude of successive prediction updates decays at $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, which implies the same convergence rate bound for the multicalibration error over rounds. Under additional smoothness assumptions on the weak learners, this rate improves to linear convergence. We further analyze adaptive variants, showing local quadratic convergence of the training loss, and we study rescaling schemes that preserve convergence. Experiments on real-world datasets support our theory and clarify the regimes in which the method achieves fast convergence and strong multicalibration.

Motivation: 现有鲁棒PAC学习研究未考虑干净数据及其标签本身也可能被对抗性选择。需要研究在输入被扰动且数据被对抗性生成的条件下，如何学习鲁棒分类器

Method: 将问题形式化为在线学习问题，定义新的复杂度维度，分析其在可实现性和不可知学习设定下的理论界，并扩展到多分类和先验扰动知识场景

Result: 新维度控制了可实现设定下的错误界和不可知设定下的遗憾界；该维度比PAC学习中的传统维度更简单，可推广到多分类假设类

Conclusion: 该工作建立了对抗性鲁棒在线学习的理论基础，揭示了其学习复杂度与经典在线学习维度之间的深刻联系，为设计高效鲁棒学习算法提供了理论指导

Abstract: We study the problem of learning robust classifiers where the classifier will receive a perturbed input. Unlike robust PAC learning studied in prior work, here the clean data and its label are also adversarially chosen. We formulate this setting as an online learning problem and consider both the realizable and agnostic learnability of hypothesis classes. We define a new dimension of classes and show it controls the mistake bounds in the realizable setting and the regret bounds in the agnostic setting. In contrast to the dimension that characterizes learnability in the PAC setting, our dimension is rather simple and resembles the Littlestone dimension. We generalize our dimension to multiclass hypothesis classes and prove similar results in the realizable case. Finally, we study the case where the learner does not know the set of allowed perturbations for each point and only has some prior on them.

*Idan Pipano,Shoham Sabach,Kavosh Asadi,Mohammad Ghavamzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文将DPO算法中的KL散度推广到f-散度，发现凸性非必要条件，提出了DPO-inducing和displacement-resistant两个条件来保证可解性和防止概率坍塌，并基于此提出了具有更强理论保证且实践性能与DPO相当的新损失函数SquaredPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了推广DPO算法，使其不仅限于KL散度，并理解在f-散度下RLHF问题保持可解的充要条件，同时解决概率坍塌这一经验性问题，从而改进语言模型的对齐效果。

Method: 通过理论分析f-散度在RLHF目标中的作用，提出DPO-inducing条件刻画可解性，提出displacement-resistant条件防止概率坍塌，并选择满足这两个条件的特定f-散度函数，推导出SquaredPO损失函数。

Result: 证明了凸性不是必要条件，识别出DPO-inducing和displacement-resistant两个关键条件，开发了SquaredPO损失，该损失相比DPO具有更强的理论保证，同时在实践中表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 基于满足DPO-inducing和displacement-resistant条件的特定f-散度，提出的SquaredPO损失在理论上更稳健，在实践中与DPO性能相当，推动了直接偏好优化方法的泛化发展。

Abstract: DPO and related algorithms align language models by directly optimizing the RLHF objective: find a policy that maximizes the Bradley-Terry reward while staying close to a reference policy through a KL divergence penalty. Previous work showed that this approach could be further generalized: the original problem remains tractable even if the KL divergence is replaced by a family of $f$-divergence with a convex generating function $f$. Our first contribution is to show that convexity of $f$ is not essential. Instead, we identify a more general condition, referred to as DPO-inducing, that precisely characterizes when the RLHF problem remains tractable. Our next contribution is to establish a second condition on $f$ that is necessary to prevent probability displacement, a known empirical phenomenon in which the probabilities of the winner and the loser responses approach zero. We refer to any $f$ that satisfies this condition as displacement-resistant. We finally focus on a specific DPO-inducing and displacement-resistant $f$, leading to our novel SquaredPO loss. Compared to DPO, this new loss offers stronger theoretical guarantees while performing competitively in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional variational data assimilation (DA) is computationally expensive in ML-based weather forecasting, while existing generative ML DA methods require many sampling steps and accumulate errors during long-term cycling.

Method: Proposes FlowDA: a flow-matching framework conditioned on observations via SetConv embedding, fine-tuned on the Aurora foundation model for weather-scale analysis generation.

Result: Outperforms baselines at very low observation rates (0.1%-3.9%), shows robustness to observational noise, and maintains stable performance in long-horizon auto-regressive cycling DA.

Conclusion: FlowDA demonstrates an efficient, scalable path for data-driven DA, resolving computational bottlenecks while enabling high-fidelity weather forecasting with limited observations.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is a fundamental component of modern weather prediction, yet it remains a major computational bottleneck in machine learning (ML)-based forecasting pipelines due to reliance on traditional variational methods. Recent generative ML-based DA methods offer a promising alternative but typically require many sampling steps and suffer from error accumulation under long-horizon auto-regressive rollouts with cycling assimilation. We propose FlowDA, a low-latency weather-scale generative DA framework based on flow matching. FlowDA conditions on observations through a SetConv-based embedding and fine-tunes the Aurora foundation model to deliver accurate, efficient, and robust analyses. Experiments across observation rates decreasing from $3.9\%$ to $0.1\%$ demonstrate superior performance of FlowDA over strong baselines with similar tunable-parameter size. FlowDA further shows robustness to observational noise and stable performance in long-horizon auto-regressive cycling DA. Overall, FlowDA points to an efficient and scalable direction for data-driven DA.

### [79] [Calibrating Tabular Anomaly Detection via Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06810)
*Hangting Ye,He Zhao. Wei Fan,Xiaozhuang Song,Dandan Guo,Yi Chang,Hongyuan Zha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTAD is a model-agnostic post-processing framework that enhances any tabular anomaly detector by calibrating sample-specific anomaly scores using Optimal Transport distance between empirical and structural distributions of normal data, consistently improving performance across diverse datasets without additional tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular anomaly detection is fundamentally challenging due to data heterogeneity: features lack natural relationships, vary in distribution and scale, and exhibit diverse types. Consequently, existing methods make implicit assumptions that work only on specific datasets, and no single method consistently outperforms across all scenarios, necessitating a more universal calibration approach.

Method: The approach characterizes normal data via two complementary distributions: an empirical distribution from random sampling and a structural distribution from K-means centroids. It measures disruption using Optimal Transport distance when adding a test sample, where normal samples cause low disruption and anomalies cause high disruption. This provides a calibration signal to amplify detection. The method is model-agnostic and applied as post-processing to any existing detector.

Result: Experiments on 34 diverse tabular datasets with 7 representative detectors across all major TAD categories (density estimation, classification, reconstruction, isolation-based) demonstrate CTAD consistently improves performance with statistical significance. It enhances even state-of-the-art deep learning methods and shows robust performance across diverse hyperparameter settings.

Conclusion: CTAD offers a general, theoretically-grounded framework that boosts any tabular anomaly detector without requiring additional tuning, making it highly practical for real-world deployment. The OT distance lower bound and expected higher calibration scores for anomalies explain its strong generalization across heterogeneous datasets.

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection (TAD) remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of tabular data: features lack natural relationships, vary widely in distribution and scale, and exhibit diverse types. Consequently, each TAD method makes implicit assumptions about anomaly patterns that work well on some datasets but fail on others, and no method consistently outperforms across diverse scenarios. We present CTAD (Calibrating Tabular Anomaly Detection), a model-agnostic post-processing framework that enhances any existing TAD detector through sample-specific calibration. Our approach characterizes normal data via two complementary distributions, i.e., an empirical distribution from random sampling and a structural distribution from K-means centroids, and measures how adding a test sample disrupts their compatibility using Optimal Transport (OT) distance. Normal samples maintain low disruption while anomalies cause high disruption, providing a calibration signal to amplify detection. We prove that OT distance has a lower bound proportional to the test sample's distance from centroids, and establish that anomalies systematically receive higher calibration scores than normals in expectation, explaining why the method generalizes across datasets. Extensive experiments on 34 diverse tabular datasets with 7 representative detectors spanning all major TAD categories (density estimation, classification, reconstruction, and isolation-based methods) demonstrate that CTAD consistently improves performance with statistical significance. Remarkably, CTAD enhances even state-of-the-art deep learning methods and shows robust performance across diverse hyperparameter settings, requiring no additional tuning for practical deployment.

Conclusion: 通过平坦度优化实现混合建模的简洁性，为平衡机器学习灵活性与科学模型可解释性提供了新范式

Abstract: Hybrid modeling, the combination of machine learning models and scientific mathematical models, enables flexible and robust data-driven prediction with partial interpretability. However, effectively the scientific models may be ignored in prediction due to the flexibility of the machine learning model, making the idea of hybrid modeling pointless. Typically some regularization is applied to hybrid model learning to avoid such a failure case, but the formulation of the regularizer strongly depends on model architectures and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose to focus on the flatness of loss minima in learning hybrid models, aiming to make the model as simple as possible. We employ the idea of sharpness-aware minimization and adapt it to the hybrid modeling setting. Numerical experiments show that the SAM-based method works well across different choices of models and datasets.

Abstract: Reliable short-term demand forecasting is essential for managing shared micro-mobility services and ensuring responsive, user-centered operations. This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy. The model exhibits strong spatial and temporal robustness across stations and time periods. A zero-shot forecasting experiment further highlights T-STAR's ability to transfer to previously unseen service areas without retraining. These results underscore the framework's potential to deliver granular, reliable, and uncertainty-aware short-term demand forecasts, which enable seamless integration to support multimodal trip planning for travelers and enhance real-time operations in shared micro-mobility services.

Abstract: Adaptive methods like Adam have become the $\textit{de facto}$ standard for large-scale vector and Euclidean optimization due to their coordinate-wise adaptation with a second-order nature. More recently, matrix-based spectral optimizers like Muon (Jordan et al., 2024b) show the power of treating weight matrices as matrices rather than long vectors. Linking these is hard because many natural generalizations are not feasible to implement, and we also cannot simply move the Adam adaptation to the matrix spectrum. To address this, we reformulate the AdaGrad update and decompose it into a variance adaptation term and a scale-invariant term. This decoupling produces $\textbf{DeVA}$ ($\textbf{De}$coupled $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{A}$daptation), a framework that bridges between vector-based variance adaptation and matrix spectral optimization, enabling a seamless transition from Adam to adaptive spectral descent. Extensive experiments across language modeling and image classification demonstrate that DeVA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Muon and SOAP (Vyas et al., 2024), reducing token usage by around 6.6\%. Theoretically, we show that the variance adaptation term effectively improves the blockwise smoothness, facilitating faster convergence.

Abstract: The smoothness of the transformer architecture has been extensively studied in the context of generalization, training stability, and adversarial robustness. However, its role in transfer learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the ability of vision transformer components to adapt their outputs to changes in inputs, or, in other words, their plasticity. Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance. Our findings depart from the prevailing assumption that smoothness is desirable, offering a novel perspective on the functional properties of transformers.

### [84] [Sample Complexity of Causal Identification with Temporal Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06899)
*Ameya Rathod,Sujay Belsare,Salvik Krishna Nautiyal,Dhruv Laad,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper integrates time-series dynamics and multi-environment heterogeneity to solve the ill-posed causal graph recovery problem. It establishes unified identifiability conditions, showing temporal structure can compensate for insufficient environmental diversity. The work reveals that while identifiability conditions remain invariant under heavy-tailed noise, sample complexity dramatically increases compared to Gaussian assumptions, providing fundamental statistical limits for real-world causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal graph recovery from observational data is fundamentally ill-posed as multiple mechanisms can produce identical distributions. Previous work separately exploited either temporal dynamics or environmental heterogeneity, leaving gaps in understanding their complementary benefits and statistical limits under realistic non-Gaussian noise conditions.

Method: The authors integrate time-series and multi-environment heterogeneity as complementary constraints, developing unified necessary identifiability conditions. They conduct rigorous statistical analysis comparing thin-tailed (Gaussian) versus heavy-tailed (Student's t) noise distributions, deriving explicit information-theoretic bounds on sample complexity and recovery limits.

Result: (1) Temporal structure can substitute for missing environmental diversity, enabling identifiability even with insufficient heterogeneity; (2) Geometric identifiability conditions remain invariant across noise distributions; (3) Sample complexity diverges significantly for heavy-tailed noise compared to Gaussian baseline; (4) Explicit information-theoretic bounds quantify the robustness cost.

Conclusion: The work fundamentally shifts focus from theoretical identifiability to practical statistical recoverability, establishing the first fundamental limits of covariance-based causal recovery in non-stationary systems with realistic noise distributions.

Abstract: Recovering a unique causal graph from observational data is an ill-posed problem because multiple generating mechanisms can lead to the same observational distribution. This problem becomes solvable only by exploiting specific structural or distributional assumptions. While recent work has separately utilized time-series dynamics or multi-environment heterogeneity to constrain this problem, we integrate both as complementary sources of heterogeneity. This integration yields unified necessary identifiability conditions and enables a rigorous analysis of the statistical limits of recovery under thin versus heavy-tailed noise. In particular, temporal structure is shown to effectively substitute for missing environmental diversity, possibly achieving identifiability even under insufficient heterogeneity. Extending this analysis to heavy-tailed (Student's t) distributions, we demonstrate that while geometric identifiability conditions remain invariant, the sample complexity diverges significantly from the Gaussian baseline. Explicit information-theoretic bounds quantify this cost of robustness, establishing the fundamental limits of covariance-based causal graph recovery methods in realistic non-stationary systems. This work shifts the focus from whether causal structure is identifiable to whether it is statistically recoverable in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究针对无约束在线凸优化(OCO)问题，提出首个时变移动成本下的比较器自适应动态遗憾界算法，达到Õ(√((1+P_T)(T+∑λ_t)))的遗憾上界，并应用于延迟反馈和时变记忆场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准OCO中移动成本系数通常为常数或零，但实际应用中移动成本往往随时间动态变化。本文旨在推广标准设定，允许移动成本系数λ_t任意时变，并寻求能够自适应比较器序列的动态遗憾界，以覆盖更广泛的实际应用场景。

Method: 提出一种新颖的算法框架，将时变移动成本问题作为核心模型。针对延迟反馈和时变记忆两种应用，建立转化为时变移动成本问题的约化方法，证明这些看似不同的问题可统一处理。关键在于算法设计实现了对移动成本的一阶依赖。

Result: 获得首个比较器自适应动态遗憾界：Õ(√((1+P_T)(T+∑λ_t)))，其中P_T为比较器序列路径长度。当所有λ_t=0时，该界退化为标准OCO的最优静态和动态遗憾界。算法在延迟反馈和时变记忆设置下均能实现最优遗憾保证。

Conclusion: 该框架展现了强大的普适性，揭示了延迟反馈、时变记忆与时变移动成本之间的深刻联系。移动成本的一阶依赖特性是实现最优比较器自适应保证的关键，为处理复杂动态环境提供了新的理论工具和视角。

Abstract: In this paper, we study dynamic regret in unconstrained online convex optimization (OCO) with movement costs. Specifically, we generalize the standard setting by allowing the movement cost coefficients $λ_t$ to vary arbitrarily over time. Our main contribution is a novel algorithm that establishes the first comparator-adaptive dynamic regret bound for this setting, guaranteeing $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{(1+P_T)(T+\sum_t λ_t)})$ regret, where $P_T$ is the path length of the comparator sequence over $T$ rounds. This recovers the optimal guarantees for both static and dynamic regret in standard OCO as a special case where $λ_t=0$ for all rounds. To demonstrate the versatility of our results, we consider two applications: OCO with delayed feedback and OCO with time-varying memory. We show that both problems can be translated into time-varying movement costs, establishing a novel reduction specifically for the delayed feedback setting that is of independent interest. A crucial observation is that the first-order dependence on movement costs in our regret bound plays a key role in enabling optimal comparator-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees in both settings.

*Dania Humaidan,Jiahua Xu,Jing Chen,Christoph Zrenner,David Emanuel Vetter,Laura Marzetti,Paolo Belardinelli,Timo Roine,Risto J. Ilmoniemi,Gian Luca Romani,Ulf Zieman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning-based closed-loop EEG-TMS system was developed to automatically identify individual brain states (mu-rhythm phases) associated with high/low corticospinal excitability, demonstrating that stimulating at these phases can modulate sensorimotor network connectivity and advancing towards personalized brain disorder treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TMS uses a one-size-fits-all approach ignoring individual differences, and existing brain state-dependent EEG-TMS still requires user-defined target phases, necessitating an automated, user-independent system for personalized treatment.

Method: 25 participants received EEG-TMS targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network. A reinforcement learning algorithm identified individual mu-rhythm phases linked to high/low corticospinal excitability. Linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis assessed effects on motor evoked potential amplitudes and resting-state EEG connectivity.

Result: Reinforcement learning successfully identified individual mu-rhythm phases associated with high vs. low excitability states. Repetitive stimulation at these phases produced long-term increases or decreases in functional connectivity within the sensorimotor network.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the first successful implementation of closed-loop EEG-TMS in humans, providing a critical foundation for individualized, state-dependent TMS treatment protocols for brain disorders.

Abstract: Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful tool to investigate neurophysiology of the human brain and treat brain disorders. Traditionally, therapeutic TMS has been applied in a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences. Brain state-dependent EEG-TMS, such as coupling TMS with a pre-specified phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm, enables the induction of differential neuroplastic effects depending on the targeted phase. But this approach is still user-dependent as it requires defining an a-priori target phase. Objectives: To present a first realization of a machine-learning-based, closed-loop real-time EEG-TMS setup to identify user-independently the individual mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-corticospinal excitability states. Methods: We applied EEG-TMS to 25 participants targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network and used a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low corticospinal excitability. We employed linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis to determine effects of reinforced learning on corticospinal excitability indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude, and functional connectivity indexed by the imaginary part of resting-state EEG coherence. Results: Reinforcement learning effectively identified the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-excitability states, and their repetitive stimulation resulted in long-term increases vs. decreases in functional connectivity in the stimulated sensorimotor network. Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of closed-loop EEG-TMS in humans, a critical step towards individualized treatment of brain disorders.

Abstract: The recent surge in Time Series Foundation Models has rapidly advanced the field, yet the heterogeneous training setups across studies make it difficult to attribute improvements to architectural innovations versus data engineering. In this work, we investigate the potential of a standard patch Transformer, demonstrating that this generic architecture achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance using a straightforward training protocol. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study that covers model scaling, data composition, and training techniques to isolate the essential ingredients for high performance. Our findings identify the key drivers of performance, while confirming that the generic architecture itself demonstrates excellent scalability. By strictly controlling these variables, we provide comprehensive empirical results on model scaling across multiple dimensions. We release our open-source model and detailed findings to establish a transparent, reproducible baseline for future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEIA improves model robustness on unknown subgroups by identifying and adapting only to a low-dimensional error subspace without requiring group labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often fail systematically on unlabeled or unknown subpopulations, but existing robust methods require prior group annotations which are frequently unavailable in real-world settings.

Method: LEIA is a two-stage method that first identifies a low-dimensional subspace where model errors concentrate in the representation space, then applies low-rank adjustments to classifier logits to restrict adaptation to this error-informed subspace without modifying the backbone network or needing group labels.

Result: Evaluated on five real-world datasets across three settings (no/partial/full subgroup knowledge), LEIA consistently improves worst-group performance while maintaining speed, parameter efficiency, and robustness to hyperparameter choices.

Conclusion: LEIA provides a simple, effective, and practical solution for improving group robustness without requiring subgroup annotations or backbone modifications, making it suitable for real-world applications where sensitive subgroups are unknown or unlabeled.

Abstract: Deep learning models trained to optimize average accuracy often exhibit systematic failures on particular subpopulations. In real world settings, the subpopulations most affected by such disparities are frequently unlabeled or unknown, thereby motivating the development of methods that are performant on sensitive subgroups without being pre-specified. However, existing group-robust methods typically assume prior knowledge of relevant subgroups, using group annotations for training or model selection. We propose Low-rank Error Informed Adaptation (LEIA), a simple two-stage method that improves group robustness by identifying a low-dimensional subspace in the representation space where model errors concentrate. LEIA restricts adaptation to this error-informed subspace via a low-rank adjustment to the classifier logits, directly targeting latent failure modes without modifying the backbone or requiring group labels. Using five real-world datasets, we analyze group robustness under three settings: (1) truly no knowledge of subgroup relevance, (2) partial knowledge of subgroup relevance, and (3) full knowledge of subgroup relevance. Across all settings, LEIA consistently improves worst-group performance while remaining fast, parameter-efficient, and robust to hyperparameter choice.

Conclusion: 椭圆性是使马尔可夫扩散过程强化学习（带函数逼近）难度不高于监督学习的关键结构性质，为连续时间控制问题提供理论保障的新算法框架

Abstract: We study off-policy reinforcement learning for controlling continuous-time Markov diffusion processes with discrete-time observations and actions. We consider model-free algorithms with function approximation that learn value and advantage functions directly from data, without unrealistic structural assumptions on the dynamics.
  Leveraging the ellipticity of the diffusions, we establish a new class of Hilbert-space positive definiteness and boundedness properties for the Bellman operators. Based on these properties, we propose the Sobolev-prox fitted $q$-learning algorithm, which learns value and advantage functions by iteratively solving least-squares regression problems. We derive oracle inequalities for the estimation error, governed by (i) the best approximation error of the function classes, (ii) their localized complexity, (iii) exponentially decaying optimization error, and (iv) numerical discretization error. These results identify ellipticity as a key structural property that renders reinforcement learning with function approximation for Markov diffusions no harder than supervised learning.

Motivation: 现有推测解码部署将推测器训练与服务解耦，导致部署延迟、反馈滞后和模型重定向时的性能退化。

Method: 将在线推测器学习重构为异步强化学习问题，利用接受/拒绝的token作为正/负反馈，集成SGLang推理服务器与异步训练服务器，支持热更新。

Conclusion: 统一的训练-服务闭环消除了离线训练延迟，使推测解码更适合实际LLM服务场景。

Abstract: Speculative decoding can significantly accelerate LLM serving, yet most deployments today disentangle speculator training from serving, treating speculator training as a standalone offline modeling problem. We show that this decoupled formulation introduces substantial deployment and adaptation lag: (1) high time-to-serve, since a speculator must be trained offline for a considerable period before deployment; (2) delayed utility feedback, since the true end-to-end decoding speedup is only known after training and cannot be inferred reliably from acceptance rate alone due to model-architecture and system-level overheads; and (3) domain-drift degradation, as the target model is repurposed to new domains and the speculator becomes stale and less effective.
  To address these issues, we present Aurora, a unified training-serving system that closes the loop by continuously learning a speculator directly from live inference traces. Aurora reframes online speculator learning as an asynchronous reinforcement-learning problem: accepted tokens provide positive feedback, while rejected speculator proposals provide implicit negative feedback that we exploit to improve sample efficiency. Our design integrates an SGLang-based inference server with an asynchronous training server, enabling hot-swapped speculator updates without service interruption. Crucially, Aurora supports day-0 deployment: a speculator can be served immediately and rapidly adapted to live traffic, improving system performance while providing immediate utility feedback. Across experiments, Aurora achieves a 1.5x day-0 speedup on recently released frontier models (e.g., MiniMax M2.1 229B and Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B). Aurora also adapts effectively to distribution shifts in user traffic, delivering an additional 1.25x speedup over a well-trained but static speculator on widely used models (e.g., Qwen3 and Llama3).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning unsupervised representations that are both semantically meaningful and stable across runs remains a central challenge in modern representation learning.

Method: Proposes EOFlows that orders latent dimensions by their explained entropy (like PCA's explained variance), enabling adaptive injective flows where only top C latent variables are retained post-training. Combines likelihood-based training with local Jacobian regularization and noise augmentation to scale to high-dimensional image data.

Result: Experiments on CelebA show the method uncovers semantically interpretable features, allows high compression, and provides strong denoising capabilities.

Conclusion: EOFlows successfully learns stable, semantically meaningful unsupervised representations with flexible compression, offering interpretable and adaptive representation learning for high-dimensional data.

Abstract: Learning unsupervised representations that are both semantically meaningful and stable across runs remains a central challenge in modern representation learning. We introduce entropy-ordered flows (EOFlows), a normalizing-flow framework that orders latent dimensions by their explained entropy, analogously to PCA's explained variance. This ordering enables adaptive injective flows: after training, one may retain only the top C latent variables to form a compact core representation while the remaining variables capture fine-grained detail and noise, with C chosen flexibly at inference time rather than fixed during training. EOFlows build on insights from Independent Mechanism Analysis, Principal Component Flows and Manifold Entropic Metrics. We combine likelihood-based training with local Jacobian regularization and noise augmentation into a method that scales well to high-dimensional data such as images. Experiments on the CelebA dataset show that our method uncovers a rich set of semantically interpretable features, allowing for high compression and strong denoising.

Abstract: Addressing class imbalance is a central challenge in credit card fraud detection, as it directly impacts predictive reliability in real-world financial systems. To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models. These results highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning and data-driven optimization for advancing trustworthy fraud analytics in financial systems.

Abstract: An information particle can acquire active-like motion through transforming the information entropy into effective self-propulsion velocity/force using the attached information engine. We consider an underdamped Brownian particle additionally driven by either a constant self-propulsion force or an information engine using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) bath feedback control, such particles are called self-propelled particle (SPP) or OU information particle (OUIP). Compared to the widely-investigated SPP, the OUIP shows a significant different dynamical pattern, including two types of moving mode: a slow-speed diffusion mode and a high-speed traveling mode. The specific evolution of OUIP can be adjusted flexibly between such two modes through the inertial effect, thus acquiring a rich and non-trivial motion behavior. By tuning the strength of fluctuation of the OU bath, a wide range of net velocity can be achieved for OUIP. We highlight that OUIP could be an exceptional candidate for active agent.

Result: 在所有与给定宏观约束相容的微观结构中，那些使观测结果在统计上最典型的结构被选中；即使参考测度完全置换对称，有序微观结构也能纯粹从约束推断中涌现。

Conclusion: 秩序不是被假设而是被推断出来的，这仅作为受观测约束的更广泛关系解释假设类别的例证，展示了约束推断框架解释涌现现象的能力。

Abstract: We study how macroscopic observational constraints restrict admissible microscopic explanatory structures when no intrinsic order or dynamics is assumed a priori. Starting from an unordered collection of measurement outcomes, we formulate inference as a constrained large deviation problem, selecting probability assignments that minimize relative entropy with respect to a reference measure determined solely by the measurement setup. We show that among all microscopic structures compatible with a given macroscopic constraint, those rendering the observation statistically most typical are selected. As an explicit illustration, we demonstrate how ordered microscopic structures can emerge purely from inference under constraint, even when the reference measure is fully permutation symmetric. Order is thus not assumed but inferred, serving here only as an illustrative example of a broader class of relational explanatory hypotheses constrained by observation.

Abstract: The Gibbs paradox is a conventional paradox in classical statistical mechanics, typically resolved by invoking quantum indistinguishability through the 1/N! correction. In this letter, we present a resolution within classical ensemble theory, which relies solely on the equal probability principle and does not invoke the 1/N! correction. Our resolution can be naturally interpretated from a purely informational perspective, where the Gibbs entropy is explicitly regarded as the Shannon entropy, quantifying ignorance rather than disorder. From this informational perspective, we also clarify the connection between information and extractable work in the gas mixing processes. Our work opens a new avenue to reconsider the role of information in statistical mechanics.

Method: 采用微谐振器作为信息比特，通过反馈生成虚拟势场并引入可调磁滞效应，构造具有可调有效温度的非平衡稳态。

Result: 实验实现了能耗低于兰道尔极限20%以上的信息擦除过程，发现磁滞效应充当嵌入式麦克斯韦妖，利用时空信息降低系统熵和热力学转换成本。

Conclusion: 该方案为研究随机系统中反馈、信息与能量的相互作用提供了通用平台，深化了对信息与热力学基本关系的理解。

Abstract: The Landauer principle establishes a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of the erasure of a one-bit memory in thermal equilibrium. Here, we experimentally demonstrate how this bound can be effectively circumvented by introducing a hysteresis in the feedback-generated virtual potential of a micro-resonator acting as the information bit. By tuning the hysteresis, we engineer a non-equilibrium steady state with an adjustable effective temperature, enabling erasure processes that consume over 20 percents below the Landauer bound. Our results reveal that the hysteresis acts as an embedded Maxwell demon, exploiting temporal and spatial information to reduce the system's entropy and the thermodynamic transformation cost. This approach provides a versatile platform for exploring the interplay between feedback, information, and energy in stochastic systems.

Abstract: We consider the sixth-order convective-viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation, different from the standard fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation due to the modified expression for the thermodynamic potential. In such modified thermodynamic potential the coefficient at the square gradient term is order-parameter-dependent. It also contains the square of the Laplacian. This results in a sixth-order differential equation and additional nonlinear terms in the equation. We obtained several exact static- and traveling wave solutions and studied the dependence of solutions on the parameters of the system.

### [99] [Second law of thermodynamics in closed quantum many-body systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06657)
*Yuuya Chiba,Yasushi Yoneta,Ryusuke Hamazaki,Akira Shimizu*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper resolves the quantum-thermodynamics conflict by introducing "infinite-observable macroscopic thermal equilibrium" (iMATE) and "macroscopic operations," proving that no extensive work can be extracted from equilibrium states and that entropy cannot decrease, thus establishing the second law in quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconcile quantum mechanics with thermodynamics, specifically addressing how the second law of thermodynamics for adiabatic operations emerges in quantum systems, since pure quantum states violate the classical second law by allowing work extraction through arbitrary unitary operations.

Method: Introduces two key quantum-mechanical concepts: (1) infinite-observable macroscopic thermal equilibrium (iMATE) where all additive observables match equilibrium values, and (2) macroscopic operations as unitary evolution generated by time-dependent additive Hamiltonians. Uses these to analyze work extraction and entropy changes.

Result: (1) Proves no extensive work can be extracted from any iMATE state via macroscopic operations; (2) Introduces a quantum entropy density matching thermodynamic entropy; (3) Shows this entropy cannot be decreased by macroscopic operations followed by relaxation, thus proving two forms of the second law.

Conclusion: The theory successfully proves the second law of thermodynamics for quantum systems using macroscopically reasonable definitions of observables, equilibrium states, and operations, resolving the fundamental conflict between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics.

Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics for adiabatic operations -- constraints on state transitions in closed systems under external control -- is one of the fundamental principles of thermodynamics. On the other hand, it is recently established that even pure quantum states can represent thermal equilibrium. However, pure quantum states do not satisfy the second law in that they are not passive, i.e., work can be extracted from them if arbitrary unitary operations are allowed. It therefore remains unresolved how quantum mechanics can be reconciled with thermodynamics. Here, based on our key quantum-mechanical notions of thermal equilibrium and adiabatic operations, we address the emergence of the second law for adiabatic operations in the thermodynamics limit. We first introduce infinite-observable macroscopic thermal equilibrium (iMATE); a quantum state, including pure states, is in iMATE if the expectation values of all additive observables agree with their equilibrium values. We also introduce a macroscopic operation as unitary evolution generated by a time-dependent additive Hamiltonian, which is regarded as corresponding to adiabatic operations. Employing these concepts, we show that no extensive work can be extracted from any quantum state in iMATE through any macroscopic operations. Furthermore, we introduce a quantum-mechanical form of entropy density such that it agrees with thermodynamic entropy density for any quantum state in iMATE. We then prove that for any initial state in iMATE, this entropy density cannot be decreased by any macroscopic operations, followed by a time-independent relaxation process. Our theory thus proves two different forms of the second law, by adopting macroscopically reasonable classes of observables, equilibrium states, and operations. We also discuss the time scales of macroscopic operations in these results.

Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in dynamical systems, occurring in a wide range of contexts such as mechanical, chemical, biological, and social systems. In this work, we explore a novel manifestation of synchronization in accelerator-based light sources, specifically in storage rings where relativistic electron bunches circulate and emit synchrotron radiation, used for user experiments. In such systems, a systematic spatio-temporal instability arises when the bunch contains a large number of electrons. This instability is characterized by the spontaneous formation of microstructures within the bunch, which appear with a bursting behavior. We demonstrate that these bursting events can be synchronized with an external sinusoidal signal by modulating the electric field in a radiofrequency (RF) cavity. This external modulation induces typical synchronization features such as Arnold tongues at fundamental, harmonic, and subharmonic frequencies of the natural bursting rate, as well as phase-slip phenomena near the synchronization threshold. The synchronization mechanism is analyzed using numerical simulations based on the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation, and a proof-of-principle experiment is conducted at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility.

Abstract: Qualitative changes in thermodynamic and single-particle properties characterize the transition between the pseudogapped electronic liquid and the Fermi liquid. Recent cold-atom experiments on a simulator of the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hoppings \cite{kendrick2025pseudogap} showed that the isothermal compressibility $κ(δ)$ has a maximum as a function of doping $δ$. Here we use the two-particle self-consistent plus (TPSC+) approach to explain these experiments and connect the maximum in $κ(δ)$ to the transformation of the single-particle spectrum from the pseudogapped to the metallic regime. This elucidates the nature of the pseudogap (PG). Specifically, the maximum in $κ(δ)$ practically coincides with the doping at which the precursor of the lower $(π,π)$ spin density wave (SDW) band at the antinodal point crosses the zero-frequency $ω=0$. The Knight shift, $χ_{sp}(0,0)(δ)$, as a function of doping, should also have a maximum. The maxima in both quantities should exist, at sufficiently low temperatures ($T$), in both the intermediate $U \approx U_{Mott}$ and weak $U < U_{Mott}$ interaction limits. In both limits, the mechanism is critical thermal SDW fluctuations. At the antinodal pseudogap, the correlation length at $δ_{max}(T)$ can be small, controlled not by static but by dynamic critical thermal fluctuations. We also find that the SDW fluctuations are incommensurate at $δ=δ_{max}$. We predict that, at low $T$, the multiple peaks in the spin susceptibility in the incommensurate case lead to more than two SDW precursor peaks in the spectral function and density of states. By allowing access to parameter regimes relevant to cuprates-including further-neighbor hopping ($t', t''$) and low temperatures, our work provides a high-impact tool for further studies by the broader community.

TL;DR: This study analyzes a 1D spin-1/2 XX chain with trimer-dimer units under transverse field, revealing 1/5 and 3/5 magnetization plateaus governed by global periodicity Q=5, with phase diagram showing Luttinger liquid, gapless AFM, plateau, and polarized states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore quantum magnetism in interacting trimer-dimer spin chains by investigating elementary excitations and magnetization plateaus under transverse magnetic field, extending theoretical understanding beyond conventional uniform chains.

Method: Employed Green's function theory combined with Jordan-Wigner transformation to map the system onto spinless fermions, focusing on antiferromagnetic interactions to analyze zero-temperature magnetization and excitation spectra.

Result: Observed distinct 1/5 and 3/5 magnetization plateaus determined by global periodicity Q=5; phase diagram includes Luttinger liquid state, gapless AFM state, two plateau states, and fully polarized state, with phase widths linked to excitation bandwidths/gaps.

Conclusion: Generalized Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck condition proves magnetization plateaus depend on global chain periodicity (Q=5) rather than local unit periodicity, opening new pathways for experimental/theoretical studies of cluster-based quantum magnets.

Abstract: We study the elementary excitations and magnetization of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XX chain comprising trimer-dimer units (the J1-J1-J2-J3-J2 topology) under a transverse magnetic field h. Using Green's function theory and the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the system onto spinless fermions and focus on antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. At zero temperature, distinct 1/5 and 3/5 magnetization plateaus emerge, determined by the global periodicity Q=5, with the number of plateaus matching the number of excitation gaps above the Fermi level of the spinless fermions. The magnetic phase diagram in the (h-Js) plane features a Luttinger liquid (LL) state, a gapless AFM state, two magnetization plateau states, and a fully polarized gapped magnetic state. The widths of the LL and gapless AFM phases are found to be proportional to the bandwidths gamma = |E(k=0)-E(k=pi)| of the corresponding elementary excitations, whereas the widths of the magnetization plateau states are governed by the excitation gaps. Our study opens new directions for exploring interacting trimer-dimer spin chains in quantum magnetism using experimental techniques such as neutron scattering, as well as theoretical and numerical approaches including quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Furthermore, we extend the Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck (OYA) condition to generalized cluster chains, demonstrating that the allowed magnetization plateaus are governed by the global periodicity of the chain (e.g., Q=5 for a trimer-dimer chain), rather than by the local periodicity of individual units (Q=3 for a trimer or Q=2 for a dimer).

Abstract: Spin-orbital liquids provide an exactly solvable route to three-dimensional Z2 quantum spin liquids beyond the original Kitaev setting. Built from higher-dimensional Clifford-algebra representations, spin-orbital Hamiltonians can be realized on both three- and four-coordinated lattices, giving rise to phases with 3 and 2 itinerant Majorana flavors. We demonstrate that these models host a rich set of gapless Majorana metals, characterized, in particular, by topological Fermi surfaces, nodal lines, and Weyl semimetal phases. We analyze the stability of these structures under physically motivated perturbations and identify generic splitting patterns and topological transitions driven by symmetry breaking and flavor mixing. This yields a unified organizing framework for three-dimensional Majorana metals in fractionalized spin liquids.

Abstract: Spectroscopic measurements in model one-dimensional (1D) correlated systems offer insights for understanding their two-dimensional counterparts, which include the cuprate and iron pnictide/chalcogenide superconductors. A major challenge is the identification of such correlated systems with dominantly 1D physics. In this work, inelastic neutron scattering measurements on NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As single crystal directly reveal quasi-1D spin excitations, resulting from atomic order that lead to magnetic Fe and nonmagnetic Cu chains. The dominant exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic along the chain ($SJ_{\rm \parallel}\approx90.1(3)$~meV), whereas the inter-chain couplings are much weaker ($SJ_{\rm \perp}\approx-2.4(1)$~meV and $SJ_{\rm c}\approx0.15(5)$~meV). The quasi-1D spin excitations in NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As stem from both the Néel and stripe vectors, with Néel excitations sensitive to Fe impurities on the Cu site. The spin excitations in quasi-1D NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As and quasi-2D FeSe exhibit a striking resemblance, suggesting a common origin for their coexistent stripe and Néel excitations. Our findings demonstrate magnetic dilution in NaFeAs leads to dimension reduction of its magnetic degree of freedom, presenting a strategy for discovering low-dimensional quantum materials.

Abstract: Photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful technique for studying electronic structure and spin-state transitions, as it reveals changes in the orbital configuration accompanying a spin-state crossover. In this report, we combine excitation-energy-, temperature-, and geometry-dependent photoemission measurements to probe the electronic structure of LaCoO3 across its thermally driven spin-state transition. By systematically comparing valence-band spectra across a wide photon-energy window - from surface-sensitive soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPS) to bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) - we identify the Co 3d-derived feature (A) along with the O 2p-dominated features (B and C), and explain their relative evolution in terms of photon-energy-dependent photo-ionization cross-section ratios. The thermally induced spin-state crossover is demonstrated using temperature-dependent SXPS valence-band spectra, which show a progressive suppression of the feature A with heating. Geometry-dependent HAXPES measurements further clarify how the signature of the spin-state transition in LaCoO3 is intricately linked to the orbital-selective response of the t2g and eg states. Additionally, angular-dependent photo-ionization cross-section analysis provides a consistent description of the polarization dependence observed in HAXPES. Finally, configuration-interaction analysis of the Co 2p core-level spectra reveals that LaCoO3 evolves from a predominantly low-spin ground state at low temperature to a mixed low-spin/high-spin configuration at elevated temperatures, with the high-spin fraction reaching about 30 percent at 400 K. The temperature evolution of the core-level line shape thus establishes Co 2p photoemission as a sensitive quantitative probe of spin-state transitions in LaCoO3.

Motivation: Conventional Majorana platforms based on 2e topological superconductors (TSCs) face computational constraints for fault-tolerant quantum information processing, necessitating enhanced computational power.

Method: Constructs 4e TSC by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in stacked 2e p+ip TSCs or melting ν=2/3 quantum Hall state, integrating charge-4e condensate with Abelian chiral Z₃ topological order.

Result: Demonstrates hc/(4e) fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects enabling anyon transmutation; Z₃ parafermion zero modes in vortex cores encode qutrits, with defect braiding generating full many-qutrit Clifford group.

Conclusion: Establishes hierarchical electron aggregation as a new principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational capabilities, enabling universal quantum gates through interferometric magic-state preparation.

Abstract: Topological superconductors (TSCs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $ν=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QGEM models rely on Newtonian approximations assuming spacetime distance, potentially obscuring fundamental quantum aspects of gravitational entanglement

Method: Reformulating gravitational interaction phase via conformally invariant twistor framework that eliminates spacetime distance assumptions

Result: The bilocal entanglement-generating phase remains well-defined and non-factorizable without spacetime geometry; Newtonian 1/r phase emerges only after breaking conformal invariance with infinity twistor

Conclusion: Isolates the core quantum content of QGEM protocols and demonstrates spacetime geometry's contingent (not fundamental) role in mediating entanglement

Abstract: Quantum-gravity-induced entanglement of massive systems (QGEM) is commonly approximated in the nonrelativistic static limit by a Newtonian interaction between spatially separated masses. In this work, we reformulate the gravitationally mediated interaction phase in a conformally invariant twistor framework in which no notion of spacetime distance is assumed. We show that the bilocal phase responsible for entanglement generation remains well-defined and non-factorizable even in the absence of spacetime geometry. The familiar Newtonian $1/r$ phase, relevant for QGEM protocols, arises only after the conformal invariance is broken by introducing the infinity twistor, which selects a particular spacetime representation of the underlying bilocal quantum interaction. Our results isolate the genuinely quantum content of QGEM protocols and clarify the contingent role played by spacetime geometry in mediating entanglement.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators and digital quantum computers are two distinct paradigms driving near-term applications in modern quantum science, from probing many-body phenomena to identifying computational advantage over classical systems. A transformative opportunity on the horizon is merging the high-fidelity many-body evolution in analog simulators with the robust control and measurement of digital machines. Such a hybrid platform would unlock new capabilities in state preparation, characterization and dynamical control. Here, we embed digital quantum control in the analog evolution of a synthetic quantum material by entangling the lattice potential landscape of a Bose-Hubbard circuit with an ancilla qubit. This Hamiltonian-level control induces dynamics under a superposition of different lattice configurations and guides the many-body system to novel strongly-correlated states where different phases of matter coexist -- ordering photons into superpositions of solid and fluid eigenstates. Leveraging hybrid control modalities, we adiabatically introduce disorder to localize the photons into an entangled cat state and enhance its coherence using a many-body echo technique. This work illustrates the potential for entangling quantum computers with quantum matter -- synthetic and solid-state -- for advantage in sensing and materials characterization.

Method: Implemented the Dicke model using a 2D crystal of ~100 trapped ions, where ions' internal states are optically coupled to collective vibrational modes via spin-dependent forces, enabling controllable unitary many-body dynamics beyond mean-field limits.

Result: Observed a ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic dynamical phase transition in the integrable regime; in the non-integrable regime, detected chaotic signatures (erratic trajectories, exponential entanglement growth via Rényi entropy), and generated 2.6 dB spin-phonon squeezing below the standard quantum limit with vacuum Rabi revivals.

Conclusion: Large ion crystals serve as scalable analog quantum simulators for non-equilibrium light-matter dynamics, providing a controlled platform to study quantum information scrambling and entanglement in closed many-body systems.

Abstract: Quantum many-body systems driven far from equilibrium can exhibit chaos, entanglement, and non-classical correlations, yet directly observing these phenomena in large, closed quantum systems remains challenging. Here we realize the Dicke model -- a fundamental description of light-matter interactions -- in a two-dimensional crystal of approximately 100 trapped ions. The ions' internal state is optically coupled to the center of mass vibrational mode via an optical spin-dependent force, enabling unitary many-body dynamics beyond the mean-field and few-body limits. In the integrable regime, where the phonons can be adiabatically eliminated, we observe a dynamical phase transition between ferromagnetic to paramagnetic spin phases. In contrast, when the spins and phonons are strongly coupled, we observe clear signatures of non-integrable chaotic dynamics, including erratic phase-space trajectories and the exponential growth of excitations and entanglement quantified by the one-body Rényi entropy. By quenching from an unstable fixed point in the near-integrable regime, quantum noise can generate correlated spin-phonon excitations. Our numerical calculations, in clear agreement with experiment, reveal the generation of two-mode spin-phonon squeezing, 2.6 dB below the standard quantum limit (4.6 dB relative to the initial thermal state), followed by generalized vacuum Rabi collapses and revivals. Our results establish large ion crystals as scalable analog quantum simulators of non-equilibrium light-matter dynamics and provide a controlled platform for experimental studies of information scrambling and entanglement in closed many-body systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 格点规范理论描述了粒子物理中的基本相互作用，其中禁闭现象将夸克和反夸克束缚成强子。模拟禁闭动力学极具挑战性，但近期量子模拟的进展使得探索超越经典计算能力的格点规范理论成为可能。在模拟中，主要困难在于实现强普适圈相互作用，这些相互作用会产生驱动粗糙化转变的弦涨落。理解弦的粗糙化——即强横向涨落导致长程平移对称性有效恢复——对禁闭研究至关重要。

Method: 研究团队将三角里德堡原子阵列映射到(2+1)维U(1)格点规范理论，其中普适圈项表现为一阶过程。他们研究了连接静态电荷的磁通弦，并分析了在去禁闭量子临界点附近的行为，同时考察了淬火后的实时动力学。

Result: 他们发现弦的粗糙化自然涌现。随着电荷间距增加，弦的横向宽度呈现对数增长，并表现出普适的吕歇修正对禁闭势的影响——这两个都是弦粗糙化的特征。此外，他们还观察到初始刚性弦在淬火进入粗糙化区域后的实时动力学行为，以及通过粒子对产生导致的弦断裂现象。

Conclusion: 粗糙弦可以在实验可及的量子模拟器中实现，这为详细研究强涨落如何影响弦断裂动力学打开了大门，并推动了利用里德堡原子阵列模拟复杂规范理论的研究。

Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe fundamental interactions in particle physics. A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal Lüscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics.

TL;DR: A stepwise Hamiltonian deformation approach is proposed to enhance VQE for ground-state preparation, using adiabatic principles to track ground states through intermediate problems, with theoretical guarantees of trainability and numerical validation under shot noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable preparation of many-body ground states is essential for quantum computing applications, but existing variational methods like VQE struggle with complex energy landscapes, often getting trapped in suboptimal local minima or suffering from barren plateaus.

Method: An iterative strategy that performs stepwise (discretized) Hamiltonian deformation, solving a sequence of intermediate problems to track the ground-state manifold toward the target system while incorporating adiabatic principles into VQE.

Result: Theoretical proof of a lower bound on loss variance indicating trainability when avoiding gap closings, and numerical simulations with shot noise demonstrating consistent convergence to the target ground state.

Conclusion: This path-dependent tracking method reliably prepares ground states and scales with system size, overcoming key limitations of traditional variational approaches.

Abstract: Reliable preparation of many-body ground states is an essential task in quantum computing, with applications spanning areas from chemistry and materials modeling to quantum optimization and benchmarking. A variety of approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, including variational methods. However, variational training often struggle to navigate complex energy landscapes, frequently encountering suboptimal local minima or suffering from barren plateaus. In this work, we introduce an iterative strategy for ground-state preparation based on a stepwise (discretized) Hamiltonian deformation. By complementing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with adiabatic principles, we demonstrate that solving a sequence of intermediate problems facilitates tracking the ground-state manifold toward the target system, even as we scale the system size. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving a lower bound on the loss variance that suggests trainability throughout the deformation, provided the system remains away from gap closings. Numerical simulations, including the effects of shot noise, confirm that this path-dependent tracking consistently converges to the target ground state.

Abstract: We propose a method for directly measuring the quantum mechanical pseudo-distribution of observable properties via its characteristic function. Vandermonde matrices of the eigenvalues play a central role in the theory. This proposal directly finds the pseudo-distribution using weak measurements of the generator of position moments (momentum translations). While the pseudo-distribution can be extracted from the data in a theory-agnostic way, it is shown that under quantum-mechanical formalism, the predicted pseudo-distribution is identified with the Kirkwood-Dirac pseudo-distribution. We discuss the construction of both the joint pseudo-distribution and a conditional pseudo-distribution, which is closely connected to weak-value physics. By permuting position and momentum measurements, we give a prescription to directly probe the canonical commutation relation and verify it for any quantum state. This work establishes the theory of a characteristic function approach to pseudo-distributions, as well as providing a constructive approach to measuring them directly.

Abstract: The N-representability problem for reduced density matrices remains a fundamental challenge in electronic structure theory. Following our previous work that employs a unitary-evolution algorithm based on an adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter variational quantum algorithm to probe pure-state N-representability of reduced density matrices [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 9968], in this work we propose a practical framework for determining the ensemble N-representability of a p-body matrix. This is accomplished using a purification strategy consisting of embedding an ensemble state into a pure state defined on an extended Hilbert space, such that the reduced density matrices of the purified state reproduce those of the original ensemble. By iteratively applying variational unitaries to an initial purified state, the proposed algorithm minimizes the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between its p-body reduced density matrix and a specified target p-body matrix, which serves as a measure of the N-representability of the target. This methodology facilitates both error correction of defective ensemble reduced density matrices, and quantum-state reconstruction on a quantum computer, offering a route for density-matrix refinement. We validate the algorithm with numerical simulations on systems of two, three, and four electrons in both, simple models as well as molecular systems at finite temperature, demonstrating its robustness.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers an alternative paradigm for addressing combinatorial optimization problems compared to classical computing. Despite recent hardware improvements, the execution of empirical quantum optimization experiments at scales known to be hard for state-of-the-art classical solvers is not yet in reach. In this work, we offer a different way to approach combinatorial optimization with near-term quantum computing. Motivated by the promising results observed in using quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) for approximating complicated probability distributions, we combine ideas of sampling from the device with QeMCMC together with warm-starting and parallel tempering, in the context of combinatorial optimization. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm recovers the global optima for instances of the Maximum Independent Set problem (MIS) up to 117 decision variables using 117 qubits on IBM quantum hardware. We show early evidence of a scaling advantage of our algorithm compared to similar classical methods for the chosen instances of MIS. MIS is practically relevant across domains like financial services and molecular biology, and, in some cases, already difficult to solve to optimality classically with only a few hundred decision variables.

Abstract: Randomness processing in the Bernoulli factory framework provides a concrete setting in which quantum resources can outperform classical ones. We experimentally demonstrate an entanglement-assisted quantum Bernoulli factory based on Bell-basis measurements of two identical input quoins prepared on IBM superconducting hardware. Using only the measurement outcomes (and no external classical randomness source), we realize the classically inconstructible Bernoulli doubling primitive $f(p)=2p$ and, as intermediate outputs from the same Bell-measurement statistics, an exact fair coin $f(p)=1/2$ and the classically inconstructible function $f(p)=4p(1-p)$. We benchmark the measured output biases against ideal predictions and discuss the impact of device noise. Our results establish a simple, resource-efficient experimental primitive for quantum-to-classical randomness processing and support the viability of quantum Bernoulli factories for quantum-enhanced stochastic simulation and sampling tasks.

Abstract: We present a relaxation-based method to bound expectation values on the steady state of dissipative many-body quantum systems described by master equations of the Lindblad form. Instead of targeting to represent the entire state, we promote the reduced density matrices to our variables and enforce the constraints that are imposed on them by consistency with a global steady state. The resulting constraints have the form of a semidefinite program, which allows us to efficiently bound the values a given expectation value can take in the steady state. Our results show fast convergence of the bounds with the size of the reduced density matrices, giving very competitive predictions for the steady state of several one- and two-dimensional models for an arbitrary number of particles.

Conclusion: 混合经典-量子方案有效降低了量子图像加载的实现成本，同时保持重建质量，推动了实用量子图像处理的发展。

Abstract: We present a hybrid classical-quantum image preparation scheme that reduces the quantum implementation cost of image loading for quantum pixel information encoding (QPIE). The proposed method, termed JPEG-assisted QPIE (JQPIE), loads only the quantized JPEG coefficients into a quantum register, leading to substantial reductions in \texttt{CX} gate count and circuit depth while preserving reconstruction quality comparable to classical JPEG compression. We develop two variants of the hybrid strategy. The first realizes the complete JPEG decompression pipeline coherently by implementing inverse quantization via a block-encoded unitary operator. The second, referred to as \emph{quantization-free JQPIE} (QF-JQPIE), omits quantization altogether, thereby avoiding the probabilistic nature of block-encoded quantization. Numerical simulations on standard benchmark image datasets (USC--SIPI and Kodak) demonstrate that both variants achieve significant constant-factor reductions in \texttt{CX} gate count and circuit depth relative to direct QPIE loading, while maintaining high reconstruction quality as measured by PSNR and SSIM.

Abstract: Radiation impacts are a current challenge with computing on superconducting-based quantum devices because they can lead to widespread correlated errors across the device. Such errors can be problematic for quantum error correction (QEC) codes, which are generally designed to correct independent errors. To address this, we have developed a computational model to simulate the effects of radiation impacts on QEC performance. This is achieved by building from recently developed models of quasiparticle density, mapping radiation-induced qubit error rates onto a quantum error channel and simulation of a simple surface code. We also provide a performance metric to quantify the resilience of a QEC code to radiation impacts. Additionally, we sweep various parameters of chip design to test mitigation strategies for improved QEC performance. Our model approach is holistic, allowing for modular performance testing of error mitigation strategies and chip and code designs.

Abstract: We propose a novel method for generating Schrödinger-cat states -- defined as equal superpositions of arbitrary coherent states -- using a concise sequence of rapid twist-and-turn pulses. We demonstrate that the required shearing strength for the protocol, which scales linearly with time, decreases with increasing number of atoms ($N$) in proportion to $1/\sqrt{N}$. The resulting states exhibit optimal quantum Fisher information, making them ideal for surpassing the classical limit of phase sensitivity in quantum metrology applications. Notably, our protocol is compatible with a time-reversal strategy for quantum metrology, ensuring its practical viability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Heisenberg limit scaling remains intact even when reducing the twisting employed in tandem with the number of atoms, thereby mitigating realistic losses such as photon scattering.

Abstract: Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) produce true random numbers based on the inherent randomness of quantum theory, rendering them a foundational segment of quantum cryptography. Distinguished from trusted-device QRNGs whose security depends on characterized devices, semi-device-independent (semi-DI) QRNGs permit partial devices to be defective or even maliciously manipulated, which achieves a good trade-off between generation rate and security. In this paper, we propose a semi-DI QRNG that resists general attacks while accounting for finite-size effects. The protocol requires no rigorous characterization of the source and measurement devices other than limiting the energy of the emitted states, significantly reducing the demands on practical QRNG systems. Leveraging the tight Kato inequality for correlated variables, we show that our protocol generates more randomness than it consumes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scheme on a continuous-variable system with ternary inputs of states. Heterodyne detection is employed to enable phase compensation through data postprocessing, alleviating the stringent requirement on system stability. The system operates at 100 MHz, achieving a net random number generation rate of 1.165 Mbps at 5.3x10^9 rounds. Our work offers a promising approach to achieve both the robust security and high generation rate with a simple experimental setup.

Abstract: Recent quantum-inspired methods based on the Simulated Annealing algorithm have shown strong potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, Grover's algorithm in gate-based quantum computing offers only a quadratic speedup, which remains impractical for large problem sizes. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that integrates Simulated Annealing with Grover's algorithm to achieve sub-exponential speedup, thereby improving its industrial applicability.
  In enzyme fermentation, variables such as temperature, stirring, wait time, pH, tryptophan, rice flour and others are encoded by 625 binary parameters, defining the space of possible enzyme formulations. We aim to find a binary configuration that maximizes the active ingredient, formulated as a 625-bit Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem generated from historical experiments and artificial intelligence techniques. Minimizing the QUBO cost corresponds to maximizing the active ingredient. This case study demonstrates that the proposed hybrid method achieves sub-exponential speedup using gate-based quantum computing.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of ligand--receptor electron transfer and conformational response in a prototypical viral binding complex, using the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein bound to the human ACE2 receptor as a model system. Treating the ACE2--Spike interface as an open quantum system embedded in a biological environment, we simulate how vibrational interactions and environmental memory reshape the coupled receptor--ligand dynamics and modulate vibrationally assisted electron transfer (VA-ET). Using a Non-Markovian Stochastic Schr"odinger Equation (NMSSE) approach, we simulate electron transfer between donor and acceptor states in ACE2 modulated by a specific vibrational mode of the Spike protein. The influence of environmental memory (non-Markovian dynamics) and non-Condon effects (vibrational modulation of electronic coupling) are analyzed in detail. In the Markovian limit with an Ohmic bath, population dynamics reduce to exponential kinetics, and extracted transfer rates agree with semiclassical Marcus--Jortner predictions in the appropriate regime. Beyond the Markovian, high-temperature limit, we observe clear deviations: non-exponential decay, coherent oscillatory features, and enhanced sensitivity to the vibrational frequency. Incorporating off-diagonal system--bath coupling alongside diagonal coupling shows that nuclear motion can dynamically gate electron tunneling, sharpening the frequency selectivity of the VA-ET mechanism. Finally, a structured (sub-Ohmic) environmental spectral density with long-lived correlations (``memory'') preserves electronic--vibrational coherence over longer times, amplifying vibrational selectivity under non-Condon coupling. Our results support the proposition that ACE2--Spike binding may exploit vibrational assistance and quantum coherence as a molecular recognition mechanism.

Abstract: The preparation of $n$-qubit quantum states is a cross-cutting subroutine for many quantum algorithms, and the effort to reduce its circuit complexity is a significant challenge. In the literature, the quantum state preparation algorithm by Sun et al. is known to be optimally bounded, defining the asymptotically optimal width-depth trade-off bounds with and without ancillary qubits. In this work, a simpler algebraic decomposition is proposed to separate the preparation of the real part of the desired state from the complex one, resulting in a reduction in terms of circuit depth, total gates, and CNOT count when $m$ ancillary qubits are available. The reduction in complexity is due to the use of a single operator $Λ$ for each uniformly controlled gate, instead of the three in the original decomposition. Using the PennyLane library, this new algorithm for state preparation has been implemented and tested in a simulated environment for both dense and sparse quantum states, including those that are random and of physical interest. Furthermore, its performance has been compared with that of Möttönen et al.'s algorithm, which is a de facto standard for preparing quantum states in cases where no ancillary qubits are used, highlighting interesting lines of development.

Conclusion: This extensible architecture establishes a viable route toward photonic quantum simulation and fault-tolerant quantum computing by overcoming the key bottleneck of integrating nonlinear resources with scalable linear circuitry.

Abstract: Universal quantum computing requires an architecture that supports both linear circuits and, crucially, strong nonlinear resources. For quantum photonic systems, integrating such nonlinearities with scalable linear circuitry has been a major bottleneck, leaving most optical experiments without nonlinear operations and, consequently, incapable of achieving universality. Here, we report an extensible photonic computer that supports a universal gate set by seamlessly combining fully programmable, scalable linear optical networks with integrated nonlinear modules. This platform enables a broad range of quantum computing and simulation tasks. We demonstrate the quasi-deterministic generation of optical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, which are essential resources for bosonic error correction, yet had previously been realized only probabilistically. Furthermore, we simulate complex many-body quantum dynamics, exemplified by the Bose-Hubbard model. Such quantum simulation tasks have long been considered beyond the reach of photonic hardware limited to linear operations. These capabilities, enabled by our extensible architecture, establish a viable route towards photonic quantum simulation and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Conclusion: 集体模式动力学为量子同步控制提供新途径，深化了对量子系统同步调控机制的理解

Abstract: We report a normal-mode induced synchronization blockade in coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators under the influence of external drive. In this mechanism, the coupling hybridizes the oscillator modes into spectrally split normal modes. The destructive interference between the transitions to these modes blocks synchronization. We find that this blockade can be controlled simply by tuning the coupling strength and detuning allowing dynamic manipulation of quantum synchronization through collective mode dynamics. We analyze the phase-locking behaviour using perturbation analysis. Further, by deriving steady-state probability amplitudes we show how the energy redistribution and spectral splitting forms the basis of the blockade. Our results might provide new insights into how synchronization can be controlled in quantum systems.

Motivation: Transformer和大语言模型的核心自注意力机制经典实现复杂度为O(T² d)，量子计算可能提供优势，但先前方法需要解码振幅到经典对数几率且未自然实现非线性。

Method: 提出QSA利用量子态干涉实现非线性，将Renyi-1/2交叉熵损失作为可观测量期望值直接获取，避免振幅解码。采用可训练数据嵌入将数据相似性与量子态重叠关联。在经典序列预测和横场Ising量子轨迹上验证。

Conclusion: 可训练注意力是量子动力学建模的实用基元，为量子Transformer在特定情况下超越经典模型奠定基础。

Abstract: We propose a variational quantum implementation of self-attention (QSA), the core operation in transformers and large language models, which predicts future elements of a sequence by forming overlap-weighted combinations of past data. At variance with previous approaches, our QSA realizes the required nonlinearity through interference of state overlaps and returns a Renyi-1/2 cross-entropy loss directly as the expectation value of an observable, avoiding the need to decode amplitude-encoded predictions into classical logits. Furthermore, QSA naturally accommodates a constrained, trainable data-embedding that ties quantum state overlaps to data-level similarities. We find a gate complexity dominant scaling O(T d^2) for QSA, versus O(T^2 d) classically, suggesting an advantage in the practical regime where the sequence length T dominates the embedding size d. In simulations, we show that our QSA-based quantum transformer learns sequence prediction on classical data and on many-body transverse-field Ising quantum trajectories, establishing trainable attention as a practical primitive for quantum dynamical modeling.

*Tiago Pernambuco,Lucas Chibebe Céleri*

TL;DR: A geometric framework where physical laws emerge from restricted microscopic information access, modeled via gauge symmetry on density operators, leading to gauge-invariant quantum thermodynamics with unified fluctuation theorems and entropy production as irreversibility measure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a unified geometric foundation for thermodynamics by treating measurement constraints as fundamental gauge symmetries, resolving the emergence of irreversibility and thermodynamic laws from limited observability.

Method: Modeling measurement constraints as gauge symmetry acting on density operators; constructing a gauge-reduced space of physically distinguishable states; applying this to quantum thermodynamics to derive stochastic entropy descriptions and trajectory-based probability measures.

Result: Gauge-invariant entropy satisfying a general detailed fluctuation theorem; integrated fluctuation theorem and Clausius-like inequality unifying first/second laws via invariant work/coherent heat; entropy production defined as relative entropy between forward/backward trajectory measures; third law emerging as singular zero-temperature limit.

Conclusion: Irreversibility arises geometrically from limited observability; thermodynamic laws unify under information constraints; energy-based thermodynamics is a special case of broader measurement scenarios; framework generalizes to arbitrary information restrictions.

Abstract: We formulate a geometric framework in which physical laws emerge from restricted access to microscopic information. Measurement constraints are modeled as a gauge symmetry acting on density operators, inducing a gauge-reduced space of physically distinguishable states. In the case of quantum thermodynamics, this construction leads to a gauge-invariant formulation in which the invariant entropy admits a stochastic description and satisfies a general detailed fluctuation theorem. From this result, we derive an integrated fluctuation theorem and a Clausius-like inequality that unifies the first and second laws in terms of invariant work and coherent heat. Entropy production is identified with the relative entropy between forward and backward probability measures on the gauge-reduced space of thermodynamic trajectories, revealing irreversibility as a geometric consequence of limited observability. The third law emerges as a singular zero-temperature limit in which thermodynamic orbits collapse and entropy production vanishes. Since the framework applies to arbitrary information constraints, it encompasses energy-based thermodynamics as a particular case of more general measurement scenarios.

Abstract: In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), photons leaving the cavity can be irreversibly lost or reused as a power source. This dichotomy is reflected in two different thermodynamic bookkeepings of the light field, both corresponding to valid thermodynamic frameworks. In this work, we formulate a rigorous semi-classical limit of cavity QED and show that the resulting thermodynamic description may qualitatively differ from that of the fully quantised model. We find that violations of the thermodynamic uncertainty relations are recovered in the semi-classical limit only by one of the two thermodynamic frameworks: the one which treats part of the photon flux as a power source. We illustrate our findings in a three-level system coupled to a driven cavity.

Motivation: Addressing the critical need for efficient and bright single-photon sources on photonic chips to enable scalable quantum technologies.

Method: Experimental optimization of spontaneous four-wave mixing in micro-ring resonators by tuning pump/signal/idler mode coupling under pulsed pumping, balancing brightness and heralding efficiency.

Result: Achieved maximum detected pair rate of 93,000 coincidences/second (moderately over-coupled regime) and peak intrinsic idler heralding efficiency of 97.87±8.97% (near maximal over-coupling), with measurements strongly matching theoretical predictions of the coupling-efficiency trade-off.

Conclusion: Demonstrated successful experimental validation of the coupling-dependent trade-off between brightness and heralding efficiency, providing a practical pathway for designing high-performance on-chip photon sources to advance quantum technology scalability.

Abstract: Efficient and bright single photon sources on photonic chips are key to scaling quantum technologies. Spontaneous four wave mixing in micro-ring resonators creates excellent narrowband and tunable photon sources. We experimentally demonstrate the optimization of heralding efficiency and brightness by tuning the coupling of the pump, signal and idler modes into the resonator whilst operating in a pulsed pump regime. We observe a maximum detected pair rate of over 93,000~coincidences per second in a moderately over-coupled regime, alongside a high intrinsic idler heralding efficiency of 97.87$\pm$8.97\% when operating close to maximal over-coupling. The measured dependence on coupling strength is in strong agreement with theoretical predictions, experimentally validating the predicted trade-off between brightness and heralding efficiency.

Conclusion: 该混合架构通过动态调控平衡多重要素（连通性/保真度/可扩展性），为近 term 量子处理器提供可扩展解决方案，显著优于固定耦合方案

Abstract: To reduce circuit depth when executing Quantum algorithms, it is necessary to maximize qubit connectivity on a near-term quantum processor. While addressing this, we also need to ensure high gate fidelity, suppression of unwanted ZZ cross-talk, a compact layout footprint, and minimal control hardware complexity to support scalability. In current superconducting quantum chips, fixed coupling is used as it is easier to scale, but it is limited by unwanted static ZZ interaction during single qubit operations, which degrades system performance. To overcome these challenges, we have introduced a first-of-its-kind hybrid tunable-coupling architecture that connects four fixed-frequency transmon qubits using a single coupler. This hybrid coupler uses off-resonant Stark drives to tune ZZ strength between qubit pairs. Experimentally backed simulation results indicate that our proposed hybrid design maximizes the qubit connectivity while reducing control overhead. This design achieves a near 20% reduction in circuit depth compared to IBM's Heavy-Hexagonal layout, showing its potential for scalability.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer the internal computations of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet separating sparse semantic signals from high-dimensional polysemantic noise remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Quantum Sieve Tracer, a hybrid quantum-classical framework designed to characterize factual recall circuits. We implement a modular pipeline that first localizes critical layers using classical causal tracing, then maps specific attention head activations into an exponentially large quantum Hilbert space. Using open-weight models (Meta Llama-3.2-1B and Alibaba Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct), we perform a two-stage analysis that reveals a fundamental architectural divergence. While Qwen's layer 7 circuit functions as a classic Recall Hub, we discover that Llama's layer 9 acts as an Interference Suppression circuit, where ablating the identified heads paradoxically improves factual recall. Our results demonstrate that quantum kernels can distinguish between these constructive (recall) and reductive (suppression) mechanisms, offering a high-resolution tool for analyzing the fine-grained topology of attention.

TL;DR: This paper studies "causal walls" - tri-partite unitaries that permanently stop local operators from spreading in quantum many-body systems - to understand the link between causality and non-ergodic dynamics through algebraic symmetries, area-law entanglement, and spectral properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the fundamental connection between causality and many-body quantum dynamics by studying how local operator spreading can be permanently arrested (non-ergodic behavior), offering insights into constrained quantum systems.

Method: Analyzes algebraic structure of tri-partite unitary "walls" that create causal independence; uses embedded sub-algebra invariance (generalized symmetry) to split operator space; applies representation theory of finite matrix algebras to derive wall gates; studies entanglement area-laws and spectral form factor for random ensembles.

Result: Derives general form of wall gates as unitary automorphisms; proves entanglement area-law emerges from local constraints; examines stability against measurements; compares spectral correlations with chaotic ensembles via spectral form factor, showing distinct signatures of causal independence.

Conclusion: Provides rigorous quantum information-theoretic framework for locally constrained quantum dynamics, establishing causal independence as a minimal model for non-ergodic behavior with characteristic algebraic structure, entanglement properties, and spectral features distinct from universal quantum chaos.

Abstract: This paper explores the connection between causality and many-body dynamics by studying the algebraic structure of tri-partite unitaries ('walls') which permanently arrest local operator spreading in their time-periodic evolution. We show that the resulting causally independent subsystems arise from the invariance of an embedded sub-algebra in the system (ie. a generalised symmetry) that leads to the splitting of operator space into commuting sub-algebras. The commutant structure of the invariant algebra is then used to construct local conserved quantities. Using representation theory of finite matrix algebras, the general form of wall gates is derived as unitary automorphisms. Taking causal independence as a minimal model for non-ergodic dynamics, we study its effect on probes of many-body quantum chaos. We prove an entanglement area-law due to local constraints and we study its stability against projective measurements. In a random ensemble exhibiting causal independence, we compare spectral correlations with the universal (chaotic) ensemble using the spectral form factor. Our results offer a rigorous understanding of locally constrained quantum dynamics from a quantum information perspective.

TL;DR: 本文提出Jackpot框架，通过最优预算拒绝采样(OBRS)解决LLM强化学习中离策略rollout的分布不匹配问题，实现训练效率与性能的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的强化学习成本高昂，特别是因为rollout生成过程开销大。将rollout生成与策略优化解耦可显著提升效率，但会引入严重的分布不匹配问题，导致学习不稳定。

Method: 提出Jackpot框架，核心包括：(1) 最优预算拒绝采样(OBRS)直接减少rollout模型与策略之间的差异；(2) 统一训练目标，联合更新策略和rollout模型；(3) 通过top-k概率估计和批级偏差校正实现高效系统实现。

Result: 理论分析证明OBRS在可控的接受预算下能持续缩小rollout分布与目标分布的差距。实验表明，相比重要性采样基线，Jackpot显著提升训练稳定性，在Qwen3-8B-Base模型上经过300次batchsize为64的更新后，性能与在线策略强化学习相当。

Conclusion: 基于OBRS的对齐方法使我们向实用有效的LLM强化学习中rollout生成与策略优化解耦迈进了一步。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) remains expensive, particularly because the rollout is expensive. Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64. Taken together, our results show that OBRS-based alignment brings us a step closer to practical and effective decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization for RL for LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities, achieving impressive results across a wide range of tasks. Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. We additionally release a comprehensive collection of research works on LLM reasoning failures, as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures, to provide an easy entry point to this area.

*Pierriccardo Olivieri,Fausto Lasca,Alessandro Gianola,Matteo Papini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于LTLfMT的框架，用于在大规模状态空间的MDP中逻辑指定非马尔可夫奖励。该框架通过一阶理论增强表达能力，识别可处理的逻辑片段，并结合奖励机和HER方法解决奖励稀疏性问题，在连续控制任务中实现了复杂目标的自然规约。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典时序逻辑(LTLf)表达能力有限，难以处理非结构化异构数据域中的复杂任务规约，且手动谓词编码繁琐。需为大规模状态MDP设计支持非马尔可夫奖励的统一、可复用规约框架。

Method: 1) 提出LTLfMT逻辑，将谓词扩展为任意一阶理论的公式；2) 从理论上识别既易处理又足够表达性的LTLfMT片段；3) 实践上结合奖励机与事后经验回放(HER)，将一阶逻辑规约转化为可学习信号，解决奖励稀疏问题；4) 在连续控制场景中应用非线性算术理论。

Result: 该框架支持对复杂任务的直观规约，在连续控制实验中验证有效。定制化HER实现被证明是解决复杂目标任务的基石，成功弥合了高表达力与实际可计算性之间的鸿沟。

Conclusion: LTLfMT框架通过理论分析与工程方法结合，实现了大规模状态空间中非马尔可夫奖励的标准化规约，兼具表达力与实践可行性，为处理异构数据域的复杂决策问题提供了新范式。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework for the logical specification of non-Markovian rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with large state spaces. Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals.

### [141] [Do LLMs Act Like Rational Agents? Measuring Belief Coherence in Probabilistic Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06286)
*Khurram Yamin,Jingjing Tang,Santiago Cortes-Gomez,Amit Sharma,Eric Horvitz,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) are rational utility maximizers with coherent beliefs in high-stakes medical diagnosis scenarios, providing falsifiable tests for Bayesian rationality consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains requiring decisions under uncertainty and utility considerations, but their decision logic remains opaque and difficult to interpret, raising questions about their true rationality.

Method: The authors analyze LLM behaviors on medical diagnostic challenge problems, establishing falsifiable conditions to determine if reported probabilities cannot represent true beliefs of any rational agent, applying this methodology across multiple medical domains and several LLMs.

Result: The research provides empirical insights into the relationship between LLM inferences and ideal Bayesian utility maximization, revealing limitations in treating LLMs as purely rational agents through systematic evaluation of probability-action consistency.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the assumption that LLMs are rational utility maximizers and highlight the need for greater interpretability and validation before deploying them in high-stakes decision-making contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in high-stakes domains where optimal actions depend on both uncertainty about the world and consideration of utilities of different outcomes, yet their decision logic remains difficult to interpret. We study whether LLMs are rational utility maximizers with coherent beliefs and stable preferences. We consider behaviors of models for diagnosis challenge problems. The results provide insights about the relationship of LLM inferences to ideal Bayesian utility maximization for elicited probabilities and observed actions. Our approach provides falsifiable conditions under which the reported probabilities \emph{cannot} correspond to the true beliefs of any rational agent. We apply this methodology to multiple medical diagnostic domains with evaluations across several LLMs. We discuss implications of the results and directions forward for uses of LLMs in guiding high-stakes decisions.

*Qifan Zhang,Jianhao Ruan,Aochuan Chen,Kang Zeng,Nuo Chen,Jing Tang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GrAlgoBench, a graph algorithm benchmark for Large Reasoning Models, revealing two critical weaknesses: performance collapse beyond 120 nodes and counterproductive over-thinking from self-verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LRM benchmarks are limited, lacking long-context evaluation, sufficient challenge, and programmatically verifiable answers, necessitating a more rigorous testbed.

Method: Proposes GrAlgoBench using graph algorithm problems that demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained difficulty control, and enable standardized programmatic evaluation across nine systematic tasks.

Result: Experiments reveal: (1) Accuracy drops below 50% for graphs >120 nodes due to execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning; (2) LRMs exhibit over-thinking from ineffective self-verification that inflates reasoning without improving correctness.

Conclusion: GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing LRM reasoning research.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced rapidly; however, existing benchmarks in mathematics, code, and common-sense reasoning remain limited. They lack long-context evaluation, offer insufficient challenge, and provide answers that are difficult to verify programmatically. We introduce GrAlgoBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs through graph algorithm problems. Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness. By exposing these limitations, GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing the study of reasoning in LRMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Bklight999/GrAlgoBench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出DEPO框架，通过在线难度评估器在rollout前动态筛选训练数据，将计算资源优先分配给高学习潜力样本，在保持性能的同时实现rollout成本降低2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在遇到过于简单或复杂的问题时会出现梯度信号衰减，导致组间优势消失、梯度易受噪声影响、收敛稳定性受损。现有改进方法DAPO虽解决梯度消失问题，但未缓解低价值样本上rollout带来的巨大计算开销。

Method: DEPO集成一个在线难度估计器，在rollout阶段前动态评估和过滤训练数据，确保计算资源优先用于具有高学习潜力的样本。

Result: 实证结果显示DEPO在保持模型性能的同时，rollout成本最多可降低2倍，显著降低了训练高性能推理模型的计算门槛。

Conclusion: DEPO通过优化推理对齐的效率和鲁棒性，为推理扩展提供了更可持续的路径，大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), exemplified by DeepSeek-R1, have underscored the potential of scaling inference-time compute through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, GRPO frequently suffers from gradient signal attenuation when encountering problems that are either too trivial or overly complex. In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Current tokenization methods process sequential data without accounting for signal quality, limiting their effectiveness on noisy real-world corpora. We present QA-Token (Quality-Aware Tokenization), which incorporates data reliability directly into vocabulary construction. We make three key contributions: (i) a bilevel optimization formulation that jointly optimizes vocabulary construction and downstream performance, (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that learns merge policies through quality-aware rewards with convergence guarantees, and (iii) an adaptive parameter learning mechanism via Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for end-to-end optimization. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates consistent improvements: genomics (6.7 percentage point F1 gain in variant calling over BPE), finance (30% Sharpe ratio improvement). At foundation scale, we tokenize a pretraining corpus comprising 1.7 trillion base-pairs and achieve state-of-the-art pathogen detection (94.53 MCC) while reducing token count by 15%. We unlock noisy real-world corpora, spanning petabases of genomic sequences and terabytes of financial time series, for foundation model training with zero inference overhead.

TL;DR: 该论文论证了大语言模型在长时程推理任务中的失败源于自回归生成的内在不稳定性，而非仅因任务复杂性。作者证明决策优势随执行长度呈指数衰减，表明稳定推理需要离散分段形成图结构。实证测试验证了这些预测，建议未来推理系统应从单纯扩展转向结构化治理。

Motivation: 解释大语言模型在长时程推理任务中失败的原因，挑战将失败归因于任务复杂性的传统观点，提出自回归生成存在根本稳定性限制。

Method: 通过理论推导证明单路径自回归推理中决策优势呈指数衰减的定理A，并结合在合成环境和真实TextWorld任务上的实证验证。

Result: 研究揭示了与理论预测一致的可观察性能悬崖，证明长时程推理失败是自回归不稳定性的动力学后果，而不仅仅是任务复杂性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明长时程推理需要离散分段（如DAG结构）的结构化治理，纯粹自回归架构存在根本限制，暗示未来推理系统可能需要从扩展转向结构化方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet their performance often deteriorates sharply in long-horizon tasks, exhibiting systematic breakdown beyond certain scales. Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.
  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we highlight that short-horizon evaluation protocols may obscure structural instability, indicating a potential shift from scaling toward structured governance in future reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents AgentCPM-Explore, a 4B-parameter agent model that outperforms much larger models by addressing three key bottlenecks: catastrophic forgetting, reward noise sensitivity, and long-context reasoning degradation through model fusion, reward denoising, and context refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLM-based agents show remarkable potential, existing systems remain heavily reliant on large-scale models, leaving the capabilities of edge-scale models largely underexplored. This paper conducts the first systematic study on training agentic models at the 4B-parameter scale.

Method: Proposes AgentCPM-Explore, a 4B agent model trained with a holistic framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement to address catastrophic forgetting during SFT, reward noise sensitivity during RL, and reasoning degradation in long-context scenarios.

Result: AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, outperforms larger models like Claude-4.5-Sonnet and DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks, and reaches 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text tasks under pass@64.

Conclusion: The bottleneck for edge-scale models is not their inherent capability ceiling but inference stability. The well-established training framework effectively unlocks the significant, previously underestimated potential of edge-scale models.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown remarkable potential for solving complex tasks, existing systems remain heavily reliant on large-scale models, leaving the capabilities of edge-scale models largely underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on training agentic models at the 4B-parameter scale. We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks. Notably, AgentCPM-Explore achieves 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text-based tasks under pass@64. These results provide compelling evidence that the bottleneck for edge-scale models is not their inherent capability ceiling, but rather their inference stability. Based on our well-established training framework, AgentCPM-Explore effectively unlocks the significant, yet previously underestimated, potential of edge-scale models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JADE is a two-layer AI evaluation framework that combines expert knowledge encoding with dynamic claim-level assessment to solve the rigor-flexibility dilemma in evaluating agentic AI for professional tasks, showing improved stability and cross-domain transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating agentic AI on open-ended professional tasks faces a fundamental dilemma: static rubrics are rigorous but inflexible, while LLM-as-a-judge is flexible but unstable and biased. Human experts solve this by combining domain principles with dynamic claim-level assessment.

Method: A two-layer framework called JADE: Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as predefined evaluation skills for stable criteria; Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation with evidence-dependency gating to flexibly assess diverse reasoning strategies.

Result: Experiments on BizBench show JADE improves evaluation stability, reveals critical agent failure modes missed by holistic LLM evaluators, aligns with expert rubrics, and transfers effectively to medical-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: JADE successfully validates across professional domains, providing a stable yet flexible evaluation method for agentic AI systems with publicly available code.

Abstract: Evaluating agentic AI on open-ended professional tasks faces a fundamental dilemma between rigor and flexibility. Static rubrics provide rigorous, reproducible assessment but fail to accommodate diverse valid response strategies, while LLM-as-a-judge approaches adapt to individual responses yet suffer from instability and bias. Human experts address this dilemma by combining domain-grounded principles with dynamic, claim-level assessment. Inspired by this process, we propose JADE, a two-layer evaluation framework. Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as a predefined set of evaluation skills, providing stable evaluation criteria. Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation to flexibly assess diverse reasoning strategies, with evidence-dependency gating to invalidate conclusions built on refuted claims. Experiments on BizBench show that JADE improves evaluation stability and reveals critical agent failure modes missed by holistic LLM-based evaluators. We further demonstrate strong alignment with expert-authored rubrics and effective transfer to a medical-domain benchmark, validating JADE across professional domains.

TL;DR: 提出HyPER方法，通过动态分配计算资源平衡探索与利用，在提升推理准确率的同时显著减少token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时计算扩展方法存在探索-利用权衡处理僵化问题：树搜索的僵化扩展规则干扰后训练推理，而并行推理过度探索冗余路径且依赖弱答案选择。观察到最优平衡是阶段依赖的，且正误路径常在后期才发散。

Method: 将测试时扩展重新表述为假设池的动态扩展-缩减控制问题。提出HyPER（训练无关的在线控制策略），包含：1）随假设池演进而从探索转向利用的在线控制器；2）支持高效生成时利用的token级细化机制；3）长度与置信度感知的聚合策略。

Result: 在4个专家混合语言模型和多个推理基准测试中，HyPER始终实现更优的准确率-计算权衡：准确率提升8-10%，token使用量减少25-40%。

Conclusion: HyPER通过轻量级路径统计动态重分配计算，有效解决了多路径解码中的探索-利用困境，为测试时计算提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute with multi-path chain-of-thought improves reasoning accuracy, but its effectiveness depends critically on the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing approaches address this trade-off in rigid ways: tree-structured search hard-codes exploration through brittle expansion rules that interfere with post-trained reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant hypothesis paths and relies on weak answer selection. Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent.

Conclusion: 为小模型构建高性能本地深度研究系统提供可行方案，平衡效果、部署便利性和数据安全性

Abstract: Generating deep research reports requires large-scale information acquisition and the synthesis of insight-driven analysis, posing a significant challenge for current language models. Most existing approaches follow a plan-then-write paradigm, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the initial outline. However, constructing a comprehensive outline itself demands strong reasoning ability, causing current deep research systems to rely almost exclusively on closed-source or online large models. This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution. To effectively equip small models with this capability, we introduce a Multi-Stage Agentic Training strategy, consisting of cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL. Experiments on DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearch Gym demonstrate that AgentCPM-Report outperforms leading closed-source systems, with substantial gains in Insight.

Conclusion: SeeUPO是一种具有收敛保证的无critic方法，为多轮交互提供了理论保障和实践优势

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as the predominant paradigm for training large language model (LLM)-based AI agents. However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.
  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mainstream backbone RL algorithms cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free and convergence guarantees in multi-turn scenarios.
  To address this, we propose SeeUPO (Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization), a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn interactions. SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.
  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability.

Motivation: 现有VLM鲁棒性评估仅通过输出不变性衡量，隐含假设稳定预测反映稳定多模态处理，但这一假设不足以捕捉模型内部行为。

Method: 提出表征感知和频率感知的评估框架，测量内部嵌入漂移、频谱敏感性和结构平滑性，并在SEEDBench、MMMU和POPE数据集上测试现代VLMs。

Result: 发现三种失效模式：1）文本叠加等扰动下模型保持预测但内部漂移接近图像间差异量级；2）扩大规模未提升鲁棒性，更大模型更敏感；3）扰动损害推理任务，但能减少幻觉基准的误报。

Conclusion: 标准输出级评估掩盖关键鲁棒性问题，单纯扩大规模无法解决，需更全面评估框架以确保VLM可靠性。

Abstract: The robustness of Vision Language Models (VLMs) is commonly assessed through output-level invariance, implicitly assuming that stable predictions reflect stable multimodal processing. In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers.

Method: 1) ARK：将知识图谱视为(head, relation, tail)三元组序列的自回归生成模型，从数据中隐式学习类型一致性、时序有效性和关系模式；2) SAIL：ARK的变分扩展，通过学习的隐变量表示实现可控生成，支持无条件采样和部分图的条件补全

Result: 1) 在IntelliGraphs基准测试上，模型在多个数据集达到89.2%至100%的语义有效性，并能生成训练时未见的新颖图谱；2) 分析表明隐藏维度≥64时模型性能关键，架构深度影响较小；3) 循环架构在有效性上与Transformer相当，但计算效率更高

Conclusion: 自回归模型为知识图谱生成提供了有效框架，ARK和SAIL在有效性和实用性上表现优异，适用于知识库补全和问答等下游应用，且模型容量是性能关键因素

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) generation requires models to learn complex semantic dependencies between triples while maintaining domain validity constraints. Unlike link prediction, which scores triples independently, generative models must capture interdependencies across entire subgraphs to produce semantically coherent structures. We present ARK (Auto-Regressive Knowledge Graph Generation), a family of autoregressive models that generate KGs by treating graphs as sequences of (head, relation, tail) triples. ARK learns implicit semantic constraints directly from data, including type consistency, temporal validity, and relational patterns, without explicit rule supervision. On the IntelliGraphs benchmark, our models achieve 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets while generating novel graphs not seen during training. We also introduce SAIL, a variational extension of ARK that enables controlled generation through learned latent representations, supporting both unconditional sampling and conditional completion from partial graphs. Our analysis reveals that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth for KG generation, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformer-based alternatives while offering substantial computational efficiency. These results demonstrate that autoregressive models provide an effective framework for KG generation, with practical applications in knowledge base completion and query answering.

TL;DR: A novel semantic LTL-to-automata task embedding for multi-task RL that achieves SOTA performance and scales to complex specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task RL needs universal policies for unseen tasks specified by LTL, but existing methods lack scalability and full LTL support.

Method: Leverages semantic LTL-to-automata translations to create structured automata for efficient computation and expressive task embeddings to condition the policy.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across domains, successfully scaling to complex LTL specifications where existing methods fail.

Conclusion: The semantic automata-based embedding enables effective universal policy learning for complex multi-task RL with full LTL specifications.

Abstract: We study multi-task reinforcement learning (RL), a setting in which an agent learns a single, universal policy capable of generalising to arbitrary, possibly unseen tasks. We consider tasks specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae, which are commonly used in formal methods to specify properties of systems, and have recently been successfully adopted in RL. In this setting, we present a novel task embedding technique leveraging a new generation of semantic LTL-to-automata translations, originally developed for temporal synthesis. The resulting semantically labelled automata contain rich, structured information in each state that allow us to (i) compute the automaton efficiently on-the-fly, (ii) extract expressive task embeddings used to condition the policy, and (iii) naturally support full LTL. Experimental results in a variety of domains demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and is able to scale to complex specifications where existing methods fail.

*Anirudh Chari,Neil Pattanaik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在神经符号贝叶斯学习者中，主动概念学习的查询策略权衡，比较了最大化期望信息增益的理性主动学习器与人类似的积极测试策略。实验表明，理性策略在复杂规则下有效，但在简单概念上因支持不匹配而表现不佳；积极测试策略虽信息次优，却在简单规则上收敛更快，提示确认偏误可能是理性适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类概念学习通常是主动的，学习者选择查询或测试哪些实例以减少对潜在规则或类别的不确定性。主动概念学习必须在查询的信息性与学习者生成和评分假设的稳定性之间取得平衡。本研究旨在探讨这种权衡，特别是在由大型语言模型生成可执行程序并经由贝叶斯更新的神经符号贝叶斯学习者中。

Method: 我们在经典数字游戏中的一系列概念学习任务中，比较了两种查询选择策略：一种是通过最大化近似期望信息增益（EIG）的理性主动学习器，另一种是查询当前最佳假设下预测为正的实例的积极测试策略（PTS）。学习者采用神经符号贝叶斯框架，假设为由大型语言模型生成的可执行程序，并通过贝叶斯更新进行重新加权。

Result: 结果表明，当需要证伪时（例如复合或充满例外的规则），EIG策略有效，但在简单概念上表现不佳。我们将此失败归因于EIG策略与LLM提议分布之间的支持不匹配：高度诊断性的边界查询使后验分布趋向于生成器产生无效或过度特化程序的区域，导致粒子近似中的支持不匹配陷阱。相比之下，PTS虽然在信息上次优，但通过选择“安全”查询倾向于保持提议的有效性，从而在简单规则上实现更快的收敛。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，“确认偏误”可能并非认知错误，而是为在人类思维特有的稀疏、开放假设空间中保持可处理的推理而做出的理性适应。

Abstract: Human concept learning is typically active: learners choose which instances to query or test in order to reduce uncertainty about an underlying rule or category. Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting "safe" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules. Our results suggest that "confirmation bias" may not be a cognitive error, but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in the sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought.

Abstract: Training generalist agents capable of adapting to diverse scenarios requires interactive environments for self-exploration. However, interactive environments remain critically scarce, and existing synthesis methods suffer from significant limitations regarding environmental diversity and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ScaleEnv, a framework that constructs fully interactive environments and verifiable tasks entirely from scratch. Specifically, ScaleEnv ensures environment reliability through procedural testing, and guarantees task completeness and solvability via tool dependency graph expansion and executable action verification. By enabling agents to learn through exploration within ScaleEnv, we demonstrate significant performance improvements on unseen, multi-turn tool-use benchmarks such as $τ^2$-Bench and VitaBench, highlighting strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between increasing number of domains and model generalization performance, providing empirical evidence that scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型通过扩展获得强大性能，但现有结构化剪枝方法在推理期间采用固定的剪枝决策，忽略了自回归 token 生成过程中出现的稀疏模式。

Method: POP 将模型通道划分为保留、候选和剪枝三个区域。预填充阶段定义粗粒度剪枝分区，解码阶段在候选区域内生成细粒度掩码，避免全通道重新评估。粗粒度分区保留持续重要的权重，细粒度掩码提供上下文相关的变化。该方法为轻量级即插即用方案，无需预处理、离线校准、重训练或学习预测器。

Result: 在包括大语言模型、混合专家模型和视觉语言模型等多种大型基础模型上的广泛评估表明，POP 在准确率上持续优于现有剪枝方法，同时具有更小的计算开销和更低的推理延迟。

Conclusion: POP 是一种有效的动态剪枝解决方案，能显著提升大型基础模型的推理效率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) achieve strong performance through scaling, yet current structural pruning methods derive fixed pruning decisions during inference, overlooking sparsity patterns that emerge in the autoregressive token generation. In this paper, we propose POP (Partition-guided Online Pruning), an efficient online structural pruning framework that enables context-conditioned dynamic pruning with minimal computational overhead. POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding. Moreover, POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that requires no preprocessing, including offline calibration, retraining, or learning predictors. Extensive evaluations across diverse LFMs, including large language models (LLMs), mixture-of-experts models (MoEs), and vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrate that POP consistently delivers higher accuracy than existing pruning approaches while incurring smaller computational overhead and minimizing inference latency.

Conclusion: 该框架在跨领域多智能体大语言模型动态调控方面具有广阔应用前景，能主动引导模型朝向理想的社会结果对齐。

Abstract: We develop a game-theoretic framework for predicting and steering the behavior of populations of large language models (LLMs) through Nash equilibrium (NE) analysis. To avoid the intractability of equilibrium computation in open-ended text spaces, we model each agent's action as a mixture over human subpopulations. Agents choose actively and strategically which groups to align with, yielding an interpretable and behaviorally substantive policy class. We derive closed-form NE characterizations, adopting standard concave-utility assumptions to enable analytical system-level predictions and give explicit, actionable guidance for shifting alignment targets toward socially desirable outcomes. The method functions as an active alignment layer on top of existing alignment pipelines such as RLHF. In a social-media setting, we show that a population of LLMs, especially reasoning-based models, may exhibit political exclusion, pathologies where some subpopulations are ignored by all LLM agents, which can be avoided by our method, illustrating the promise of applying the method to regulate multi-agent LLM dynamics across domains.

Conclusion: 所提框架有效平衡了隐私保护与模型效率，在异构隐私约束场景下实现了更稳定的训练过程和更高的模型性能，为实用化联邦学习部署提供了新方案。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN demonstrate improved convergence stability and classification accuracy.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了可解释AI从静态预测向智能体多步决策轨迹的范式转变，发现传统的基于归因的解释方法在智能体场景中不稳定，而基于轨迹追溯的诊断方法能有效定位行为故障，特别是状态追踪不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去十年可解释AI主要聚焦于解释单个模型预测，而大语言模型催生的智能体系统通过多步决策轨迹运行。现有静态解释方法如何适应这种时序决策场景尚不明确。

Method: 通过实证比较，在静态分类任务和智能体基准测试（TAU-bench Airline和AssistantBench）上分别评估基于归因的解释方法与基于轨迹追溯的诊断方法。

Result: 归因方法在静态设置中表现稳定（Spearman ρ=0.86），但无法可靠诊断智能体执行级故障；而基于轨迹追溯的方法能持续定位行为故障，发现状态追踪不一致在失败运行中高出2.7倍，并使成功概率降低49%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要转向轨迹级别的可解释性方法，以评估和诊断自主AI智能体的行为，为智能体系统设计更适合的解释框架。

Abstract: Over the last decade, explainable AI has primarily focused on interpreting individual model predictions, producing post-hoc explanations that relate inputs to outputs under a fixed decision structure. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $ρ= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.

Abstract: LLM agents hold significant promise for advancing scientific research. To accelerate this progress, we introduce AIRS-Bench (the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others. Even when agents surpass human benchmarks, they do not reach the theoretical performance ceiling for the underlying tasks. These findings indicate that AIRS-Bench is far from saturated and offers substantial room for improvement. We open-source the AIRS-Bench task definitions and evaluation code to catalyze further development in autonomous scientific research.

Abstract: Can AI agents predict whether they will succeed at a task? We study agentic uncertainty by eliciting success probability estimates before, during, and after task execution. All results exhibit agentic overconfidence: some agents that succeed only 22% of the time predict 77% success. Counterintuitively, pre-execution assessment with strictly less information tends to yield better discrimination than standard post-execution review, though differences are not always significant. Adversarial prompting reframing assessment as bug-finding achieves the best calibration.
