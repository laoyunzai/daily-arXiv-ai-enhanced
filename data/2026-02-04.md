Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CreditAudit是一个面向部署的语言模型稳定性评估框架，通过多组语义对齐的提示模板测试模型表现，提供平均能力分数和信用评级（AAA-BBB），揭示模型在真实场景中的稳定性差异，帮助实践者做出更客观的部署决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试分数无法反映真实用户体验，系统提示和交互模式的微小变化在多步骤智能体管道中可能引发严重失败，导致实践者在模型选择时面临不确定性，需要更贴近实际部署场景的评估方法。

Method: 构建语义对齐且非对抗性的系统提示模板族，在多个基准测试中评估模型，计算跨场景的平均性能（mean ability）和场景诱导波动（sigma）作为稳定性风险信号，通过跨模型分位数映射将波动性转换为AAA至BBB的可解释信用等级，并加入诊断机制缓解模板难度漂移。

Result: 在GPQA、TruthfulQA和MMLU Pro上的对照实验表明，具有相似平均能力的模型表现出显著不同的波动性，在智能体或高失败成本场景中，稳定性风险可能推翻基于原始性能的优先级决策。

Conclusion: CreditAudit通过二维指标和信用评级语言支持特定场景的模型选择，实现分层部署和更严谨的测试监控资源分配，为真实世界中的模型评估提供了更客观、可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Leaderboard scores on public benchmarks have been steadily rising and converging, with many frontier language models now separated by only marginal differences. However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes. By providing a 2D and grade based language for regime specific selection, CreditAudit supports tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing and monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real world use.

### [2] [Uncertainty and Fairness Awareness in LLM-Based Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02582)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型推荐系统中的不确定性与公平性问题，通过构建基准数据集和案例研究发现Gemini 1.5 Flash存在系统性偏见，并提出新的评估方法以提升推荐系统的安全性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽能实现强大的零样本推荐，但其预测不确定性和内在偏见威胁着推荐系统的可靠性、一致性和公平性，亟需系统性的评估方法。

Method: 构建包含8个人口统计属性(31个类别值)的电影和音乐领域基准数据集，通过熵量化预测不确定性，进行深度案例研究，测试提示词扰动(拼写错误、多语言输入)影响，并集成人格感知公平性评估框架。

Result: Gemini 1.5 Flash在特定敏感属性上表现出系统性不公平(SNSR=0.1363, SNSV=0.0507)，偏见在各类提示词扰动下依然存在，且个性化推荐与群体公平性之间存在明显权衡。

Conclusion: 提出创新的不确定性感知评估方法和人格档案知情公平性基准，为开发更安全、可解释的RecLLMs奠定基础，并推动未来在多模型基准和自适应校准方面的研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable powerful zero-shot recommendations by leveraging broad contextual knowledge, yet predictive uncertainty and embedded biases threaten reliability and fairness. This paper studies how uncertainty and fairness evaluations affect the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of LLM-generated recommendations. We introduce a benchmark of curated metrics and a dataset annotated for eight demographic attributes (31 categorical values) across two domains: movies and music. Through in-depth case studies, we quantify predictive uncertainty (via entropy) and demonstrate that Google DeepMind's Gemini 1.5 Flash exhibits systematic unfairness for certain sensitive attributes; measured similarity-based gaps are SNSR at 0.1363 and SNSV at 0.0507. These disparities persist under prompt perturbations such as typographical errors and multilingual inputs. We further integrate personality-aware fairness into the RecLLM evaluation pipeline to reveal personality-linked bias patterns and expose trade-offs between personalization and group fairness. We propose a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology for RecLLMs, present empirical insights from deep uncertainty case studies, and introduce a personality profile-informed fairness benchmark that advances explainability and equity in LLM recommendations. Together, these contributions establish a foundation for safer, more interpretable RecLLMs and motivate future work on multi-model benchmarks and adaptive calibration for trustworthy deployment.

### [3] [A Positive Case for Faithfulness: LLM Self-Explanations Help Predict Model Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02639)
*Harry Mayne,Justin Singh Kang,Dewi Gould,Kannan Ramchandran,Adam Mahdi,Noah Y. Siegel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出归一化仿真增益(NSG)指标，通过解释对预测模型行为的提升来评估LLM自我解释忠实度。测试18个模型在7000个反事实样本上发现：自我解释使NSG达11-37%，优于外部解释，但5-15%存在严重误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM自我解释被视为AI监督的有前景工具，但其对真实推理过程的忠实度鲜为人知。现有评估指标依赖对抗性提示或错误检测，忽视了解释的预测价值，存在关键局限。

Method: 我们提出归一化仿真增益(NSG)指标，基于"忠实解释应帮助观察者学习模型决策标准从而预测行为"的理念。在健康、商业和伦理数据集上，评估了18个前沿模型（包括Gemini 3、GPT-5.2、Claude 4.5）的7000个反事实样本。

Result: 自我解释显著改善模型行为预测（NSG达11-37%），且比外部模型生成的解释更具预测价值，即使外部模型更强；但各模型有5-15%的自我解释存在严重误导。

Conclusion: 尽管存在缺陷，自我解释编码了有助于预测模型行为的信息，为AI监督提供了积极案例，同时揭示了改进忠实度评估的必要性。

Abstract: LLM self-explanations are often presented as a promising tool for AI oversight, yet their faithfulness to the model's true reasoning process is poorly understood. Existing faithfulness metrics have critical limitations, typically relying on identifying unfaithfulness via adversarial prompting or detecting reasoning errors. These methods overlook the predictive value of explanations. We introduce Normalized Simulatability Gain (NSG), a general and scalable metric based on the idea that a faithful explanation should allow an observer to learn a model's decision-making criteria, and thus better predict its behavior on related inputs. We evaluate 18 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, e.g., Gemini 3, GPT-5.2, and Claude 4.5, on 7,000 counterfactuals from popular datasets covering health, business, and ethics. We find self-explanations substantially improve prediction of model behavior (11-37% NSG). Self-explanations also provide more predictive information than explanations generated by external models, even when those models are stronger. This implies an advantage from self-knowledge that external explanation methods cannot replicate. Our approach also reveals that, across models, 5-15% of self-explanations are egregiously misleading. Despite their imperfections, we show a positive case for self-explanations: they encode information that helps predict model behavior.

*Ujin Jeon,Jiyong Kwon,Madison Ann Sullivan,Caleb Eunho Lee,Guang Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个任务分布式多智能体框架，采用EvoDPO算法实现自适应自我进化，在长期任务中优于静态基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多LLM智能体系统要么在微调后冻结求解器，要么依赖静态偏好优化循环，这在长期任务中变得难以处理。

Method: 提出ATLAS框架，通过专门的辅助智能体（探索、超参数调优、参考策略管理）和EvoDPO算法自适应更新阶段索引参考策略，并提供概念漂移下基于偏好的上下文老虎机理论遗憾分析。

Result: 在非平稳线性上下文老虎机和1D Burgers方程的科学机器学习损失重加权实验中，ATLAS在稳定性和性能上均优于静态单智能体基线。

Conclusion: 任务分布式自适应学习方法使智能体能够在复杂长期任务中实现有效的自我进化。

Abstract: Recent multi-LLM agent systems perform well in prompt optimization and automated problem-solving, but many either keep the solver frozen after fine-tuning or rely on a static preference-optimization loop, which becomes intractable for long-horizon tasks. We propose ATLAS (Adaptive Task-distributed Learning for Agentic Self-evolution), a task-distributed framework that iteratively develops a lightweight research agent while delegating complementary roles to specialized supporter agents for exploration, hyperparameter tuning, and reference policy management. Our core algorithm, Evolving Direct Preference Optimization (EvoDPO), adaptively updates the phase-indexed reference policy. We provide a theoretical regret analysis for a preference-based contextual bandit under concept drift. In addition, experiments were conducted on non-stationary linear contextual bandits and scientific machine learning (SciML) loss reweighting for the 1D Burgers' equation. Both results show that ATLAS improves stability and performance over a static single-agent baseline.

### [5] [Dynamic Mix Precision Routing for Efficient Multi-step LLM Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02711)
*Yuanzhe Li,Jianing Deng,Jingtong Hu,Tianlong Chen,Song Wang,Huanrui Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a dynamic mix-precision routing framework that adaptively selects between high and low-precision LLMs at each decision step to optimize accuracy-cost trade-off in long-horizon decision-making tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models achieve strong performance in long-horizon decision-making but using larger models incurs prohibitive inference costs, creating a tension between performance and efficiency.

Method: A dynamic mix-precision routing framework trained via a two-stage pipeline: KL-divergence-based supervised learning to identify precision-sensitive steps, followed by Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve task success rates.

Result: Experiments on ALFWorld demonstrate significant improvement in accuracy-cost trade-off over single-precision baselines and heuristic routing methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive precision selection at each interaction step effectively balances task performance and inference efficiency for long-horizon decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) achieve strong performance in long-horizon decision-making tasks through multi-step interaction and reasoning at test time. While practitioners commonly believe a higher task success rate necessitates the use of a larger and stronger LLM model, multi-step interaction with a large LLM incurs prohibitive inference cost. To address this problem, we explore the use of low-precision quantized LLM in the long-horizon decision-making process. Based on the observation of diverse sensitivities among interaction steps, we propose a dynamic mix-precision routing framework that adaptively selects between high-precision and low-precision LLMs at each decision step. The router is trained via a two-stage pipeline, consisting of KL-divergence-based supervised learning that identifies precision-sensitive steps, followed by Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to further improve task success rates. Experiments on ALFWorld demonstrate that our approach achieves a great improvement on accuracy-cost trade-off over single-precision baselines and heuristic routing methods.

### [6] [Scaling-Aware Adapter for Structure-Grounded LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02780)
*Zihao Jing,Qiuhao Zeng,Ruiyi Fang,Yan Yi Li,Yan Sun,Boyu Wang,Pingzhao Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出Cuttlefish，一种统一的原子级大语言模型，通过自适应token缩放和几何接地机制，在保持结构复杂性的同时实现更优的生物分子结构推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生物分子结构推理方法存在两大局限：一是模态特异性导致泛化性差，二是固定长度tokenization或查询连接器要么忽略几何基础引发结构幻觉，要么造成token压缩瓶颈，阻碍通用原子级推理的实现。

Method: 提出Cuttlefish统一架构：1）感知尺度的分块机制，采用指令条件门控对结构图生成可变尺寸分块，根据结构复杂度自适应分配token预算；2）几何接地适配器，通过交叉注意力精炼自适应token并注入大语言模型，提供显式几何线索以减少结构幻觉。

Result: 在多种原子级基准测试中，Cuttlefish在异构结构接地推理任务上表现出卓越性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过将语言推理与几何线索结合并实现token数与结构复杂度的动态缩放，Cuttlefish为生物分子结构推理提供了更通用、更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are enabling reasoning over biomolecular structures, yet existing methods remain modality-specific and typically compress structural inputs through sequence-based tokenization or fixed-length query connectors. Such architectures either omit the geometric groundings requisite for mitigating structural hallucinations or impose inflexible modality fusion bottlenecks that concurrently over-compress and suboptimally allocate structural tokens, thereby impeding the realization of generalized all-atom reasoning. We introduce Cuttlefish, a unified all-atom LLM that grounds language reasoning in geometric cues while scaling modality tokens with structural complexity. First, Scaling-Aware Patching leverages an instruction-conditioned gating mechanism to generate variable-size patches over structural graphs, adaptively scaling the query token budget with structural complexity to mitigate fixed-length connector bottlenecks. Second, Geometry Grounding Adapter refines these adaptive tokens via cross-attention to modality embeddings and injects the resulting modality tokens into the LLM, exposing explicit geometric cues to reduce structural hallucination. Experiments across diverse all-atom benchmarks demonstrate that Cuttlefish achieves superior performance in heterogeneous structure-grounded reasoning. Code is available at the project repository.

*Xi Yu,Dmitrii Torbunov,Soumyajit Mandal,Yihui Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出AutoSizer框架，通过反思式大语言模型元优化方法，结合双循环优化机制与电路仿真反馈，实现模拟混合信号电路晶体管尺寸的高效自动化设计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模拟电路设计严重依赖专家知识，晶体管尺寸优化存在非线性强、设计空间高维、约束严格等挑战，现有EDA方法采用静态黑盒优化导致效率低且鲁棒性差，而大语言模型虽具推理能力但不擅长精确数值优化

Method: 构建双循环优化框架：内层循环执行电路尺寸优化，外层循环通过分析优化动态和约束，结合仿真反馈迭代收缩搜索空间；同时开发包含24个SKY130工艺电路的开源基准测试集AMS-SizingBench

Result: 在多样化电路难度测试中，AutoSizer相比传统优化方法和现有LLM智能体，获得更优解质量、更快收敛速度和更高成功率

Conclusion: 该框架成功桥接大语言模型的推理能力与电路数值优化需求，通过自适应搜索空间构建与闭环优化策略，显著提升模拟电路自动化设计效率与鲁棒性

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits remains heavily reliant on expert knowledge, with transistor sizing a major bottleneck due to nonlinear behavior, high-dimensional design spaces, and strict performance constraints. Existing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) methods typically frame sizing as static black-box optimization, resulting in inefficient and less robust solutions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, they are not suited for precise numerical optimization in AMS sizing. To address this gap, we propose AutoSizer, a reflective LLM-driven meta-optimization framework that unifies circuit understanding, adaptive search-space construction, and optimization orchestration in a closed loop. It employs a two-loop optimization framework, with an inner loop for circuit sizing and an outer loop that analyzes optimization dynamics and constraints to iteratively refine the search space from simulation feedback. We further introduce AMS-SizingBench, an open benchmark comprising 24 diverse AMS circuits in SKY130 CMOS technology, designed to evaluate adaptive optimization policies under realistic simulator-based constraints. AutoSizer experimentally achieves higher solution quality, faster convergence, and higher success rate across varying circuit difficulties, outperforming both traditional optimization methods and existing LLM-based agents.

### [8] [STEER: Inference-Time Risk Control via Constrained Quality-Diversity Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02862)
*Eric Yang,Jong Ha Lee,Jonathan Amar,Elissa Ye,Yugang Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free framework called STEER uses evolutionary ensemble refinement to create diverse natural-language personas, enabling tunable control over LLM decision conservativeness in clinical triage without compromising safety or accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM alignment causes mode collapse, producing narrow decision behaviors when multiple responses are reasonable. This is particularly problematic in ordinal decision settings like clinical triage, where it removes the ability to trade off specificity and sensitivity (ROC operating point) based on contextual constraints.

Method: STEER constructs a population of natural-language personas through an offline, constrained quality-diversity search that promotes behavioral coverage while enforcing minimum safety, reasoning, and stability thresholds. At inference time, it exposes a single interpretable control parameter that maps a user-specified risk percentile to a selected persona, yielding monotonic adjustment of decision conservativeness.

Result: On two clinical triage benchmarks, STEER achieves broader behavioral coverage compared to temperature-based sampling and static persona ensembles. It maintains substantially higher accuracy on unambiguous urgent cases while providing comparable control over ambiguous decisions compared to representative post-training methods.

Conclusion: STEER demonstrates a safety-preserving paradigm for risk control, capable of steering LLM behavior without compromising domain competence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained for average correctness often exhibit mode collapse, producing narrow decision behaviors on tasks where multiple responses may be reasonable. This limitation is particularly problematic in ordinal decision settings such as clinical triage, where standard alignment removes the ability to trade off specificity and sensitivity (the ROC operating point) based on contextual constraints. We propose STEER (Steerable Tuning via Evolutionary Ensemble Refinement), a training-free framework that reintroduces this tunable control. STEER constructs a population of natural-language personas through an offline, constrained quality-diversity search that promotes behavioral coverage while enforcing minimum safety, reasoning, and stability thresholds. At inference time, STEER exposes a single, interpretable control parameter that maps a user-specified risk percentile to a selected persona, yielding a monotonic adjustment of decision conservativeness. On two clinical triage benchmarks, STEER achieves broader behavioral coverage compared to temperature-based sampling and static persona ensembles. Compared to a representative post-training method, STEER maintains substantially higher accuracy on unambiguous urgent cases while providing comparable control over ambiguous decisions. These results demonstrate STEER as a safety-preserving paradigm for risk control, capable of steering behavior without compromising domain competence.

*Marco Gutierrez,Xinyi Leng,Hannah Cyberey,Jonathan Richard Schwarz,Ahmed Alaa,Thomas Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes BenchAlign, a method to align language model benchmarks with human preferences by learning weighted question scoring from model performance data, producing benchmarks that better predict real-world model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many language model benchmarks fail to predict real-world utility despite being computationally efficient proxies, creating a gap between benchmark performance and actual usefulness that needs to be bridged.

Method: BenchAlign learns preference-aligned weightings for benchmark questions using question-level language model performance data alongside ranked pairs of models collected during deployment, automatically updating static benchmarks to predict model pairwise preferences.

Result: The aligned benchmarks accurately rank unseen models according to human preferences across different model sizes while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into the limits of aligning benchmarks with practical human preferences, which may accelerate model development toward real-world utility.

Abstract: Language model benchmarks are pervasive and computationally-efficient proxies for real-world performance. However, many recent works find that benchmarks often fail to predict real utility. Towards bridging this gap, we introduce benchmark alignment, where we use limited amounts of information about model performance to automatically update offline benchmarks, aiming to produce new static benchmarks that predict model pairwise preferences in given test settings. We then propose BenchAlign, the first solution to this problem, which learns preference-aligned weight- ings for benchmark questions using the question-level performance of language models alongside ranked pairs of models that could be collected during deployment, producing new benchmarks that rank previously unseen models according to these preferences. Our experiments show that our aligned benchmarks can accurately rank unseen models according to models of human preferences, even across different sizes, while remaining interpretable. Overall, our work provides insights into the limits of aligning benchmarks with practical human preferences, which stands to accelerate model development towards real utility.

*Kiran Tomlinson,Tobias Schnabel,Adith Swaminathan,Jennifer Neville*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文从理论上证明，随着输入规模增长，思维链推理在特定任务上需要线性数量的推理token（Ω(n)），与前沿大模型的实验结果一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链推理显著提升大语言模型性能，但带来巨大的延迟和计算成本，引发了一个基本问题：解决问题究竟需要多少推理token？

Method: 扩展有界注意力前缀预言机（BAPO）模型来量化任务所需的信息流，证明三种典型BAPO-hard任务（二元多数、三元匹配、图可达性）的推理token下界，并给出显式构造的上界，辅以前沿推理模型的实验验证。

Result: 证明当输入规模为n时，三类任务都需要Ω(n)个推理token，并通过构造性方法给出匹配或接近匹配的上界；实验显示前沿模型在这些任务上呈近似线性token缩放，且在受限预算下出现失败，与理论下界一致。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了思维链推理在推理时计算扩展中的根本性瓶颈，为分析最优推理长度提供了原则性工具，对高效部署大语言模型具有理论指导意义。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is a major driver of state-of-the-art LLM performance, but it comes with substantial latency and compute costs. We address a fundamental theoretical question: how many reasoning tokens are required to solve a problem as input size grows? By extending the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model--an abstraction of LLMs that quantifies the information flow required to solve a task--we prove lower bounds on the CoT tokens required for three canonical BAPO-hard tasks: binary majority, triplet matching, and graph reachability. We show that each requires $Ω(n)$ reasoning tokens when the input size is $n$. We complement these results with matching or near-matching upper bounds via explicit constructions. Finally, our experiments with frontier reasoning models show approximately linear reasoning token scaling on these tasks and failures when constrained to smaller reasoning budgets, consistent with our theoretical lower bounds. Together, our results identify fundamental bottlenecks in inference-time compute through CoT and offer a principled tool for analyzing optimal reasoning length.

### [11] [DeltaEvolve: Accelerating Scientific Discovery through Momentum-Driven Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02919)
*Jiachen Jiang,Tianyu Ding,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeltaEvolve replaces full-code histories with structured semantic deltas in LLM evolutionary systems, improving efficiency and solution quality while reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-driven evolutionary systems like AlphaEvolve use full-code histories that are context-inefficient and provide weak evolutionary guidance because redundant implementation details dilute core algorithmic ideas, making it difficult to provide clear inspirations for evolution.

Method: The authors formalized evolutionary agents as an Expectation-Maximization framework (E-step: sample programs, M-step: update control context) and proposed DeltaEvolve, which replaces full-code snapshots with structured semantic delta capturing how/why modifications affect performance, organized via multi-level database and progressive disclosure mechanism to reduce input tokens.

Result: Empirical evaluations on tasks across diverse scientific domains show that DeltaEvolve can discover better solutions with less token consumption compared to full-code-based evolutionary agents.

Conclusion: DeltaEvolve demonstrates that structured semantic delta is a more effective and efficient approach than full-code histories for LLM-driven evolutionary systems in automated science discovery.

Abstract: LLM-driven evolutionary systems have shown promise for automated science discovery, yet existing approaches such as AlphaEvolve rely on full-code histories that are context-inefficient and potentially provide weak evolutionary guidance. In this work, we first formalize the evolutionary agents as a general Expectation-Maximization framework, where the language model samples candidate programs (E-step) and the system updates the control context based on evaluation feedback (M-step). Under this view, constructing context via full-code snapshots constitutes a suboptimal M-step, as redundant implement details dilutes core algorithmic ideas, making it difficult to provide clear inspirations for evolution. To address this, we propose DeltaEvolve, a momentum-driven evolutionary framework that replaces full-code history with structured semantic delta capturing how and why modifications between successive nodes affect performance. As programs are often decomposable, semantic delta usually contains many effective components which are transferable and more informative to drive improvement. By organizing semantic delta through multi-level database and progressive disclosure mechanism, input tokens are further reduced. Empirical evaluations on tasks across diverse scientific domains show that our framework can discover better solution with less token consumption over full-code-based evolutionary agents.

*Elias Hossain,Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Subash Neupane,Rajib Rana,Ravid Shwartz-Ziv,Ivan Garibay,Niloofar Yousefi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出UAT-LITE框架，通过推理时的蒙特卡洛dropout近似贝叶斯推断，使预训练Transformer的自注意力机制具备不确定性感知能力，在不修改模型权重或训练目标的前提下，显著提升模型校准性并维持任务精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经NLP模型常存在预测过度自信问题（对错误预测赋予高置信度），这严重影响了选择性预测和高风险场景部署的可靠性。现有后校准方法仅调整输出概率而不改变内部计算，而集成或贝叶斯方法则需高昂的训练/存储成本。

Method: 1) 在预训练Transformer分类器中，通过推理时蒙特卡洛dropout实现近似贝叶斯推断；2) 利用随机前向传播估计token级认知不确定性；3) 将不确定性信息融入自注意力计算机制；4) 引入分层方差分解诊断不确定性在Transformer深度的累积规律。

Result: 在SQuAD 2.0（可回答性）、MNLI和SST-2数据集上，UAT-LITE相比微调BERT-base基线平均降低约20%的预期校准误差（ECE），同时保持任务精度，并提升分布外泛化能力和选择性预测性能。

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现无需重训练即可在推理阶段通过不确定性调制提升注意力机制可靠性，为高风险NLP应用提供了高效实用的校准解决方案，其分层诊断能力也为模型不确定性分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Neural NLP models are often miscalibrated, assigning high confidence to incorrect predictions, which undermines selective prediction and high-stakes deployment. Post-hoc calibration methods adjust output probabilities but leave internal computation unchanged, while ensemble and Bayesian approaches improve uncertainty at substantial training or storage cost. We propose UAT-LITE, an inference-time framework that makes self-attention uncertainty-aware using approximate Bayesian inference via Monte Carlo dropout in pretrained transformer classifiers. Token-level epistemic uncertainty is estimated from stochastic forward passes and used to modulate self-attention during contextualization, without modifying pretrained weights or training objectives. We additionally introduce a layerwise variance decomposition to diagnose how predictive uncertainty accumulates across transformer depth. Across the SQuAD 2.0 answerability, MNLI, and SST-2, UAT-LITE reduces Expected Calibration Error by approximately 20% on average relative to a fine-tuned BERT-base baseline while preserving task accuracy, and improves selective prediction and robustness under distribution shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何性质可用于稳定和加速强化学习，现有方法包括对称结构编码、几何感知数据增强和结构约束。

Method: 提出几何一致性正则化强化学习(GCR-RL)，将值函数估计重新建模为偏序集学习。通过时序差分信号细化偏序集序列，确保几何一致性。开发了基于Q学习和演员-评论家的两种算法。

Result: 理论分析了算法性质和收敛速率。实验表明GCR-RL在样本效率和稳定性能上显著优于强基线。

Conclusion: 序理论视角下的几何一致性正则化是提升强化学习效率的有效方法。

Abstract: Geometric properties can be leveraged to stabilize and speed reinforcement learning. Existing examples include encoding symmetry structure, geometry-aware data augmentation, and enforcing structural restrictions. In this paper, we take a novel view of RL through the lens of order theory and recast value function estimates into learning a desired poset (partially ordered set). We propose \emph{GCR-RL} (Geometric Coherence Regularized Reinforcement Learning) that computes a sequence of super-poset refinements -- by refining posets in previous steps and learning additional order relationships from temporal difference signals -- thus ensuring geometric coherence across the sequence of posets underpinning the learned value functions. Two novel algorithms by Q-learning and by actor--critic are developed to efficiently realize these super-poset refinements. Their theoretical properties and convergence rates are analyzed. We empirically evaluate GCR-RL in a range of tasks and demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and stable performance over strong baselines.

### [14] [Are LLMs Biased Like Humans? Causal Reasoning as a Function of Prior Knowledge, Irrelevant Information, and Reasoning Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02983)
*Hanna M. Dettki,Charley M. Wu,Bob Rehder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit rule-like causal reasoning distinct from humans, lacking typical human biases like weak explaining away and Markov violations, with chain-of-thought prompting improving robustness, suggesting they can complement humans when biases are undesirable but may fail under intrinsic uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It remains unclear whether LLMs' causal reasoning judgments reflect normative causal computation, human-like shortcuts, or brittle pattern matching, despite their increasing deployment in domains requiring causal reasoning.

Method: Benchmarked 20+ LLMs against matched human baselines on 11 causal judgment tasks formalized by a collider structure (C1→E←C2), probing robustness under semantic abstraction and prompt overloading, and testing whether chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enhances robustness.

Result: A small interpretable model compresses LLMs' causal judgments well; most LLMs use more rule-like reasoning than humans who account for unmentioned latent factors; LLMs do not mirror human collider biases (weak explaining away and Markov violations); chain-of-thought increases robustness for many LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs can complement humans by avoiding known biases, but their rule-like reasoning may break down when uncertainty is intrinsic, highlighting the need to characterize LLM reasoning strategies for safe and effective deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in domains where causal reasoning matters, yet it remains unclear whether their judgments reflect normative causal computation, human-like shortcuts, or brittle pattern matching. We benchmark 20+ LLMs against a matched human baseline on 11 causal judgment tasks formalized by a collider structure ($C_1 \!\rightarrow\! E\! \leftarrow \!C_2$). We find that a small interpretable model compresses LLMs' causal judgments well and that most LLMs exhibit more rule-like reasoning strategies than humans who seem to account for unmentioned latent factors in their probability judgments. Furthermore, most LLMs do not mirror the characteristic human collider biases of weak explaining away and Markov violations. We probe LLMs' causal judgment robustness under (i) semantic abstraction and (ii) prompt overloading (injecting irrelevant text), and find that chain-of-thought (CoT) increases robustness for many LLMs. Together, this divergence suggests LLMs can complement humans when known biases are undesirable, but their rule-like reasoning may break down when uncertainty is intrinsic -- highlighting the need to characterize LLM reasoning strategies for safe, effective deployment.

### [15] [Large Language Models Can Take False First Steps at Inference-time Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02991)
*Haijiang Yan,Jian-Qiao Zhu,Adam Sanborn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs acquire planning abilities during training but exhibit short-sighted behavior during inference. The authors propose a Bayesian "planning-shift" hypothesis: accumulated self-generated context (different from natural language) drives this gap. Two experiments confirm planning strengthens with self-generated context and reduces initial bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the discrepancy between LLMs' trained sequence-level planning abilities and their seemingly compromised, short-sighted planning behavior exhibited during inference time.

Method: Proposed a Bayesian account grounding planning in evolving generative context. Validated through two controlled experiments: 1) Random-generation task testing planning under human prompts vs. accumulated self-generated context; 2) Gaussian-sampling task examining bias reduction when conditioning on self-generated sequences.

Result: The random-generation task showed constrained planning under human prompts but increasing planning strength as self-generated context accumulates. The Gaussian-sampling task demonstrated reduced initial bias when conditioning on self-generated sequences, supporting the planning-shift hypothesis.

Conclusion: The gap in LLM planning behavior is explained by accumulated self-generated context creating a planning-shift during inference, providing theoretical explanation and empirical evidence for how LLMs plan ahead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to acquire sequence-level planning abilities during training, yet their planning behavior exhibited at inference time often appears short-sighted and inconsistent with these capabilities. We propose a Bayesian account for this gap by grounding planning behavior in the evolving generative context: given the subtle differences between natural language and the language internalized by LLMs, accumulated self-generated context drives a planning-shift during inference and thereby creates the appearance of compromised planning behavior. We further validate the proposed model through two controlled experiments: a random-generation task demonstrating constrained planning under human prompts and increasing planning strength as self-generated context accumulates, and a Gaussian-sampling task showing reduced initial bias when conditioning on self-generated sequences. These findings provide a theoretical explanation along with empirical evidence for characterizing how LLMs plan ahead during inference.

### [16] [Methods and Open Problems in Differentiable Social Choice: Learning Mechanisms, Decisions, and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03003)
*Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces "differentiable social choice," a novel framework that treats voting and decision-making mechanisms as trainable neural networks, bridging classical social choice theory with modern machine learning to address preference aggregation in algorithmic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social choice mechanisms are increasingly embedded in ML systems (auctions, federated learning, LLM alignment) but often implicitly and without normative scrutiny. There's a need to explicitly formalize and optimize these mechanisms.

Method: The paper surveys and synthesizes work on formulating voting rules, mechanisms, and aggregation procedures as differentiable, learnable models that can be optimized from data, examining how classical social choice axioms and impossibility theorems translate into ML objectives and constraints.

Result: The authors show how classical social choice concepts reemerge as optimization trade-offs in differentiable systems and identify 36 open research problems at the intersection of ML, economics, and democratic theory.

Conclusion: Differentiable social choice represents a promising new paradigm that requires further research across 36 identified open problems to fully develop this intersection of fields.

Abstract: Social choice is no longer a peripheral concern of political theory or economics-it has become a foundational component of modern machine learning systems. From auctions and resource allocation to federated learning, participatory governance, and the alignment of large language models, machine learning pipelines increasingly aggregate heterogeneous preferences, incentives, and judgments into collective decisions. In effect, many contemporary machine learning systems already implement social choice mechanisms, often implicitly and without explicit normative scrutiny.
  This Review surveys differentiable social choice: an emerging paradigm that formulates voting rules, mechanisms, and aggregation procedures as learnable, differentiable models optimized from data. We synthesize work across auctions, voting, budgeting, liquid democracy, decentralized aggregation, and inverse mechanism learning, showing how classical axioms and impossibility results reappear as objectives, constraints, and optimization trade-offs. We conclude by identifying 36 open problems defining a new research agenda at the intersection of machine learning, economics, and democratic theory.

*Ziyang Yu,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GCP框架通过图结构概念预测器将大语言模型的推理过程蒸馏到小模型中，在降低部署成本的同时提升样本效率、训练稳定性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署大语言模型进行判别性任务时面临推理延迟、计算成本和API费用等规模化限制。现有主动蒸馏方法仅蒸馏最终标签，丢弃了中间推理信号，且无法诊断推理缺失位置和错误来源。

Method: 提出图概念预测器(GCP)框架：将教师模型的决策过程外部化为有向无环图，并用模块化概念预测器在学生模型中镜像该过程；采用图感知获取策略针对关键推理节点的不确定性和分歧；通过将下游损失归因到特定概念预测器，实现目标子模块重训练。

Result: 在八个NLP分类基准测试上，GCP在有限标注预算下提升性能，并产生更具可解释性和可控性的训练动态。

Conclusion: GCP是一种有效的主动蒸馏框架，相比现有方法能更好地保留推理过程、提升样本效率和训练稳定性，同时降低大语言模型的部署成本。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for discriminative workloads is often limited by inference latency, compute, and API costs at scale. Active distillation reduces these costs by querying an LLM oracle to train compact discriminative students, but most pipelines distill only final labels, discarding intermediate reasoning signals and offering limited diagnostics of what reasoning is missing and where errors arise. We propose Graph of Concept Predictors (GCP), a reasoning-aware active distillation framework that externalizes the teacher's decision process as a directed acyclic graph and mirrors it with modular concept predictors in the student. GCP enhances sample efficiency through a graph-aware acquisition strategy that targets uncertainty and disagreement at critical reasoning nodes. Additionally, it improves training stability and efficiency by performing targeted sub-module retraining, which attributes downstream loss to specific concept predictors and updates only the most influential modules. Experiments on eight NLP classification benchmarks demonstrate that GCP enhances performance under limited annotation budgets while yielding more interpretable and controllable training dynamics.

TL;DR: 该论文提出STAR框架，通过约束知识蒸馏和相似性引导的强化学习，将大语言模型的函数调用能力迁移至超小模型，0.6B参数模型在所有1B以下开源模型中达到SOTA，超越多个更大规模模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在函数调用方面表现优异但对资源需求高，现有的小模型能力迁移方法存在过拟合、训练不稳定、多解任务奖励无效以及技术协同困难等问题，阻碍了广泛应用。

Method: 作者提出STAR（相似性引导的教师辅助精调）整体框架，包含两大创新：(1) 约束知识蒸馏(CKD)，通过增强top-k前向KL散度抑制模型对错误预测的过度自信，保证训练稳定性同时保留探索能力；(2) 相似性引导的强化学习(Sim-RL)，引入基于相似度的细粒度奖励信号，提供连续丰富的优化指导。

Result: 在多个知名基准测试上，STAR模型在同尺寸类别中达到SOTA性能。0.6B参数的STAR模型在所有1B以下开源模型中表现最佳，在复杂函数调用任务上超越了多个更大规模的开源模型。

Conclusion: STAR展示了一种有效的训练框架，可将大语言模型能力蒸馏至超小模型，为构建强大、易用且高效的AI智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in function calling is pivotal for creating advanced AI agents, yet their large scale hinders widespread adoption, necessitating transferring their capabilities into smaller ones. However, existing paradigms are often plagued by overfitting, training instability, ineffective binary rewards for multi-solution tasks, and the difficulty of synergizing techniques. We introduce STAR: Similarity-guided Teacher-Assisted Refinement, a novel holistic framework that effectively transfers LLMs' capabilities to super-tiny models. STAR consists of two core technical innovations: (1) Constrained Knowledge Distillation (CKD), a training objective that augments top-k forward KL divergence to suppress confidently incorrect predictions, ensuring training stability while preserving exploration capacity for downstream RL. STAR holistically synergizes these strategies within a cohesive training curriculum, enabling super-tiny models to achieve exceptional performance on complex function calling tasks; (2) Similarity-guided RL (Sim-RL), a RL mechanism that introduces a fine-grained, similarity-based reward. This provides a robust, continuous, and rich signal for better policy optimization by evaluating the similarity between generated outputs and the ground truth. Extensive experiments on challenging and renowned benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our STAR models establish SOTA in their size classes, significantly outperforming baselines. Remarkably, our 0.6B STAR model achieves the best performance among all open models under 1B, surpassing even several well-known open models at a larger scale. STAR demonstrates a training framework that distills capabilities of LLMs into super-tiny models, paving the way for powerful, accessible, and efficient AI agents.

### [19] [RC-GRPO: Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization for Multi-Turn Tool Calling Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03025)
*Haitian Zhong,Jixiu Zhai,Lei Song,Jiang Bian,Qiang Liu,Tieniu Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RC-GRPO uses reward-conditioned tokens to improve exploration in multi-turn tool calling for LLMs. It first trains a policy on mixed-quality trajectories with special reward tokens, then samples diverse tokens during RL to boost within-group diversity, achieving state-of-the-art results on BFCLv4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn tool calling is challenging due to sparse rewards and expensive exploration. Standard SFT+GRPO stalls when within-group reward variation is low (all 0s or all 1s), making group-normalized advantage uninformative and causing vanishing updates.

Method: Proposes RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization) that frames exploration as a controllable steering problem via discrete reward tokens. First fine-tunes a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal tokens (<|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into prompts. During RL, samples diverse reward tokens within each GRPO group to condition rollouts and improve within-group diversity.

Result: On BFCLv4 multi-turn benchmark, RC-GRPO consistently outperforms baselines. The Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct model with RC-GRPO surpasses all closed-source API models.

Conclusion: RC-GRPO effectively solves the low reward variation problem by making exploration controllable through reward conditioning, demonstrating that improving within-group diversity via reward token sampling is a powerful strategy for RL with sparse rewards in multi-turn tool calling.

Abstract: Multi-turn tool calling is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) because rewards are sparse and exploration is expensive. A common recipe, SFT followed by GRPO, can stall when within-group reward variation is low (e.g., more rollouts in a group receive the all 0 or all 1 reward), making the group-normalized advantage uninformative and yielding vanishing updates. To address this problem, we propose RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization), which treats exploration as a controllable steering problem via discrete reward tokens. We first fine-tune a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal special tokens (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into the prompts, enabling the model to learn how to generate distinct quality trajectories on demand. Then during RL, we sample diverse reward tokens within each GRPO group and condition rollouts on the sampled token to improve within-group diversity, improving advantage gains. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard v4 (BFCLv4) multi-turn benchmark, our method yields consistently improved performance than baselines, and the performance on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct even surpasses all closed-source API models.

Motivation: 现有时间序列方法在整合直观视觉推理和跨任务自适应工具使用方面存在局限

Method: 提出Analyzer-Reasoner-Executor范式，利用视觉语言模型进行时序图推理、隐空间轨迹重建，通过三智能体协作和路由选择工具链

Result: 在多个基准测试上达到SOTA性能，展现强泛化能力和高效推理

Conclusion: 成功构建了融合视觉推理与工具驱动的多智能体框架，为通用时间序列分析提供新范式

Abstract: Time series analysis underpins many real-world applications, yet existing time-series-specific methods and pretrained large-model-based approaches remain limited in integrating intuitive visual reasoning and generalizing across tasks with adaptive tool usage. To address these limitations, we propose MAS4TS, a tool-driven multi-agent system for general time series tasks, built upon an Analyzer-Reasoner-Executor paradigm that integrates agent communication, visual reasoning, and latent reconstruction within a unified framework. MAS4TS first performs visual reasoning over time series plots with structured priors using a Vision-Language Model to extract temporal structures, and subsequently reconstructs predictive trajectories in latent space. Three specialized agents coordinate via shared memory and gated communication, while a router selects task-specific tool chains for execution. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MAS4TS achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series tasks, while exhibiting strong generalization and efficient inference.

TL;DR: 本研究系统性地考察了过程验证在多智能体系统(MAS)中的有效性。通过大规模实验发现，过程验证并不能稳定提升性能且方差较大，LLM-as-a-Judge方法优于基于奖励的方法，但整体而言，为MAS设计有效且鲁棒的过程验证仍是一个开放性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型(LLM)的多智能体系统在推理轨迹上表现出高方差性。尽管过程验证（评估中间步骤）在一般推理任务中显示出潜力，并被提议用于协调MAS，但其在MAS中的实际效果尚不明确，缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 提出了MAS-ProVe系统性实证研究，涵盖三种验证范式(LLM-as-a-Judge、奖励模型、过程奖励模型)、两个验证粒度级别(智能体级和迭代级)，测试了五种验证器、四种上下文管理策略，并在六个不同的MAS框架和多个推理基准上进行了实验。

Result: 主要发现包括：1) 过程级验证不能持续提升性能且方差较大；2) LLM-as-a-Judge普遍优于基于奖励的方法，训练后的验证器超越通用LLM；3) LLM作为验证器与单智能体间的性能差距较小；4) 存在上下文长度与性能的权衡。

Conclusion: 为多智能体系统设计有效且鲁棒的过程验证仍然是一个开放性的挑战，需要超越当前范式的进一步研究进展。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit high variance in their reasoning trajectories. Process verification, which evaluates intermediate steps in trajectories, has shown promise in general reasoning settings, and has been suggested as a potential tool for guiding coordination of MAS; however, its actual effectiveness in MAS remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study of process verification for multi-agent systems (MAS). Our study spans three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models), evaluated across two levels of verification granularity (agent-level and iteration-level). We further examine five representative verifiers and four context management strategies, and conduct experiments over six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks. We find that process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and frequently exhibits high variance, highlighting the difficulty of reliably evaluating partial multi-agent trajectories. Among the methods studied, LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges surpassing general-purpose LLMs. We further observe a small performance gap between LLMs acting as judges and as single agents, and identify a context-length-performance trade-off in verification. Overall, our results suggest that effective and robust process verification for MAS remains an open challenge, requiring further advances beyond current paradigms.

TL;DR: 针对大型语言模型在现实世界部署中的安全问题，现有评估方法覆盖不足且缺乏适应性。本文提出Risky-Bench框架，通过领域无关的安全原则和情境感知评估标准，在多样化威胁假设下进行系统性安全评估，并在生活辅助场景中揭示了先进智能体的重大安全风险，为可扩展的智能体安全评估提供了新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体安全评估方法存在三大局限：1) 针对特定设置的风险导向任务导致安全空间覆盖有限；2) 无法评估长周期、交互式任务执行中的安全行为；3) 对多样化智能体配置的适应性不足。这促使研究者开发一个基于现实部署的、系统性的安全评估框架。

Method: 提出Risky-Bench框架，围绕领域无关的安全原则构建情境感知的安全评估标准，系统性地在多样化威胁假设下通过真实任务执行来评估智能体在整个安全空间中的风险表现。

Result: 在生活辅助智能体设置中，Risky-Bench揭示了当前最先进智能体在真实执行条件下存在大量安全风险。

Conclusion: Risky-Bench作为一个结构化评估流程，不仅限于生活辅助场景，还可扩展到其他部署环境，为智能体安全评估提供了可扩展的方法论，有助于构建更安全的LLM智能体系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents that operate in real-world environments, introducing safety risks beyond linguistic harm. Existing agent safety evaluations rely on risk-oriented tasks tailored to specific agent settings, resulting in limited coverage of safety risk space and failing to assess agent safety behavior during long-horizon, interactive task execution in complex real-world deployments. Moreover, their specialization to particular agent settings limits adaptability across diverse agent configurations. To address these limitations, we propose Risky-Bench, a framework that enables systematic agent safety evaluation grounded in real-world deployment. Risky-Bench organizes evaluation around domain-agnostic safety principles to derive context-aware safety rubrics that delineate safety space, and systematically evaluates safety risks across this space through realistic task execution under varying threat assumptions. When applied to life-assist agent settings, Risky-Bench uncovers substantial safety risks in state-of-the-art agents under realistic execution conditions. Moreover, as a well-structured evaluation pipeline, Risky-Bench is not confined to life-assist scenarios and can be adapted to other deployment settings to construct environment-specific safety evaluations, providing an extensible methodology for agent safety assessment.

Motivation: 多智能体LLM框架的性能影响尚不明确，架构选择可导致延迟/吞吐量出现数量级差异，以及准确性和可扩展性的显著变化。现有基准测试缺乏标准化的框架级评估。

Method: 作者创建了架构分类法并开发了MAFBench，该套件在标准化执行管道下整合现有基准测试，随后在多个框架上进行了受控实证研究。

Conclusion: 研究提供了具体的架构设计原则和框架选择指导，并指出了多智能体LLM系统有前途的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM frameworks are widely used to accelerate the development of agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs). These frameworks impose distinct architectural structures that govern how agents interact, store information, and coordinate tasks. However, their impact on system performance remains poorly understood. This gap is critical, as architectural choices alone can induce order-of-magnitude differences in latency and throughput, as well as substantial variation in accuracy and scalability. Addressing this challenge requires (i) jointly evaluating multiple capabilities, such as orchestration overhead, memory behavior, planning, specialization, and coordination, and (ii) conducting these evaluations under controlled, framework-level conditions to isolate architectural effects. Existing benchmarks focus on individual capabilities and lack standardized framework-level evaluation. We address these limitations by (i) introducing an architectural taxonomy for systematically comparing multi-agent LLM frameworks along fundamental dimensions, and (ii) developing MAFBench, a unified evaluation suite that integrates existing benchmarks under a standardized execution pipeline. Using MAFBench, we conduct a controlled empirical study across several widely used frameworks. Our results show that framework-level design choices alone can increase latency by over 100x, reduce planning accuracy by up to 30%, and lower coordination success from above 90% to below 30%. Finally, we translate our findings into concrete architectural design principles and framework selection guidance, and outline promising future research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前工作证明了在特定框架下，几乎最优且通用的确定性智能体必然包含足够的环境知识以允许近似重建，但该结果依赖于智能体确定性和环境完全可观测的假设。本研究旨在移除这两个假设。

Method: 通过将定理扩展到在部分可观测环境中运行的随机智能体，并弱化"通用性"的概念来加强结果。

Result: 1) 证明随机智能体无法通过随机化使用来避免学习其环境；2) 证明能力较弱的智能体也已经包含其所运行环境的世界模型。

Conclusion: 该工作表明，即使在更具挑战性的随机和部分可观测条件下，智能体本质上仍然包含其所处世界的模型，这深化了对智能体能力基础的理解。

Abstract: Deciding whether an agent possesses a model of its surrounding world is a fundamental step toward understanding its capabilities and limitations. In [10], it was shown that, within a particular framework, every almost optimal and general agent necessarily contains sufficient knowledge of its environment to allow an approximate reconstruction of it by querying the agent as a black box. This result relied on the assumptions that the agent is deterministic and that the environment is fully observable.
  In this work, we remove both assumptions by extending the theorem to stochastic agents operating in partially observable environments. Fundamentally, this shows that stochastic agents cannot avoid learning their environment through the usage of randomization. We also strengthen the result by weakening the notion of generality, proving that less powerful agents already contain a model of the world in which they operate.

Conclusion: 该策略为VLM在缺失模态场景提供了可靠且可扩展的解决方案，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically assume complete modality input during inference. However, their effectiveness drops sharply when certain modalities are unavailable or incomplete. Current research primarily faces two dilemmas: Prompt-based methods struggle to restore missing yet indispensable features and impair generalization of VLMs. Imputation-based approaches, lacking effective guidance, are prone to generating semantically irrelevant noise. Restoring precise semantics while sustaining VLM generalization remains challenging. Therefore, we propose a general missing modality restoration strategy in this paper. We introduce an enhanced diffusion model as a pluggable mid-stage training module to effectively restore missing features. Our strategy introduces two key innovations: (I) Dynamic Modality Gating, which adaptively leverages conditional features to steer the generation of semantically consistent features; (II) Cross-Modal Mutual Learning mechanism, which bridges the semantic spaces of dual encoders to achieve bidirectional alignment. Zero-shot evaluations across benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm our model as a robust and scalable extension for VLMs in missing modality scenarios, ensuring reliability across diverse missing rates and environments. Our code and models will be publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VALUEFLOW, a unified framework for extracting, evaluating, and steering LLM values with calibrated intensity control, addressing gaps in hierarchical structure, intensity calibration, and steerability understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with diverse human values is challenging. Preference-based methods lack depth in motivational principles, while existing value-based approaches fail to capture hierarchical structures, calibrated intensity, and controllable steering of values in LLMs.

Method: The authors propose VALUEFLOW, which integrates: (1) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space; (2) VIDB, a large-scale value-labeled text database with intensity estimates; and (3) an anchor-based evaluator that scores model outputs by ranking against VIDB panels.

Result: Through a large-scale study of ten models and four value theories, the framework revealed asymmetries in value steerability and composition laws for multi-value control, providing new insights into how LLMs can be controlled at different value intensities.

Conclusion: VALUEFLOW establishes a scalable infrastructure for evaluating and controlling value intensity in LLMs, advancing the field toward pluralistic alignment where models can be steered according to diverse human values with calibrated precision.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with the diverse spectrum of human values remains a central challenge: preference-based methods often fail to capture deeper motivational principles. Value-based approaches offer a more principled path, yet three gaps persist: extraction often ignores hierarchical structure, evaluation detects presence but not calibrated intensity, and the steerability of LLMs at controlled intensities remains insufficiently understood. To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels. Using VALUEFLOW, we conduct a comprehensive large-scale study across ten models and four value theories, identifying asymmetries in steerability and composition laws for multi-value control. This paper establishes a scalable infrastructure for evaluating and controlling value intensity, advancing pluralistic alignment of LLMs.

TL;DR: TDScaling is a data synthesis framework that improves code LLM agents by scaling trajectory diversity instead of raw data volume, addressing quality limitations and diminishing returns of quantity scaling through four innovations: Business Cluster mechanism, blueprint-driven multi-agents, adaptive evolution preventing mode collapse, and sandboxed tools that preserve coding capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code LLM agents face generalization limitations from low-quality synthetic data and diminishing returns of quantity scaling, with early bottlenecks that underutilize trajectory data efficiency under fixed training budgets.

Method: Proposed TDScaling with four innovations: (1) Business Cluster capturing real-service dependencies, (2) blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm enforcing trajectory coherence, (3) adaptive evolution using Domain Entropy/Reasoning Mode Entropy/Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse, and (4) sandboxed code tool mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Experiments on BFCL, tau^2-Bench, RebenchT, CodeCI, and BIRD benchmarks show TDScaling achieves win-win improvements in both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency, with better performance-cost trade-offs than quantity scaling.

Conclusion: Scaling trajectory diversity is more effective than scaling raw data volume for code agent training, successfully addressing data quality issues while preserving coding capabilities; authors plan to release code and 30,000+ tool cluster dataset.

Abstract: As code large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-interactive agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), their generalization is increasingly limited by low-quality synthetic data and the diminishing returns of quantity scaling. Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency. We plan to release the full codebase and the synthesized dataset (including 30,000+ tool clusters) upon publication.

### [28] [TAME: A Trustworthy Test-Time Evolution of Agent Memory with Systematic Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03224)
*Yu Cheng,Jiuan Zhou,Yongkang Hu,Yihang Chen,Huichi Zhou,Mingang Chen,Zhizhong Zhang,Kun Shao,Yuan Xie,Zhaoxia Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses Agent Memory Misevolution - the decline in safety alignment during test-time evolution of agent memory. It introduces TAME, a dual-memory framework that separately evolves executor and evaluator memories, and shows it improves both trustworthiness and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time evolution of agent memory is crucial for AGI development but suffers from safety vulnerabilities called Agent Memory Misevolution, where trustworthiness declines during benign task evolution.

Method: The authors create Trust-Memevo benchmark to evaluate trustworthiness, then propose TAME - a dual-memory evolutionary framework with executor memory for task performance and evaluator memory for safety assessment, operating through a closed-loop process of memory filtering, draft generation, refinement, execution, and updating.

Result: Experiments show TAME mitigates misevolution and achieves joint improvement in both trustworthiness and task performance across various task domains.

Conclusion: The dual-memory approach effectively preserves trustworthiness without sacrificing utility, offering a solution to the safety challenges in agent memory evolution.

Abstract: Test-time evolution of agent memory serves as a pivotal paradigm for achieving AGI by bolstering complex reasoning through experience accumulation. However, even during benign task evolution, agent safety alignment remains vulnerable-a phenomenon known as Agent Memory Misevolution. To evaluate this phenomenon, we construct the Trust-Memevo benchmark to assess multi-dimensional trustworthiness during benign task evolution, revealing an overall decline in trustworthiness across various task domains and evaluation settings. To address this issue, we propose TAME, a dual-memory evolutionary framework that separately evolves executor memory to improve task performance by distilling generalizable methodologies, and evaluator memory to refine assessments of both safety and task utility based on historical feedback. Through a closed loop of memory filtering, draft generation, trustworthy refinement, execution, and dual-track memory updating, TAME preserves trustworthiness without sacrificing utility. Experiments demonstrate that TAME mitigates misevolution, achieving a joint improvement in both trustworthiness and task performance.

Motivation: 当前智能体评估基准存在混杂因素（系统提示、工具配置、环境动态），评估框架碎片化且缺乏标准化环境数据，导致错误不可追溯、结果不可复现，造成领域不公平和缺乏透明度。

Method: 提出标准化智能体评估的统一框架方案。

Result: 论文提出了一个旨在标准化智能体评估的框架提案，为领域建立评估标准。

Conclusion: 统一评估框架对于智能体评估的严谨性进展至关重要。

Abstract: With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), general-purpose agents have seen fundamental advancements. However, evaluating these agents presents unique challenges that distinguish them from static QA benchmarks. We observe that current agent benchmarks are heavily confounded by extraneous factors, including system prompts, toolset configurations, and environmental dynamics. Existing evaluations often rely on fragmented, researcher-specific frameworks where the prompt engineering for reasoning and tool usage varies significantly, making it difficult to attribute performance gains to the model itself. Additionally, the lack of standardized environmental data leads to untraceable errors and non-reproducible results. This lack of standardization introduces substantial unfairness and opacity into the field. We propose that a unified evaluation framework is essential for the rigorous advancement of agent evaluation. To this end, we introduce a proposal aimed at standardizing agent evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Accordion-Thinking, a framework that enables LLMs to dynamically summarize their reasoning process during long-chain-of-thought, reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy through learned self-compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long Chain-of-Thought reasoning suffers from linear KV cache growth and quadratic attention complexity, creating practical limits for test-time compute scaling.

Method: They developed an end-to-end framework where LLMs learn self-regulation of reasoning granularity via dynamic summarization (Fold mode), trained with reinforcement learning to incentivize effective summarization.

Result: The model closes the accuracy gap between efficient Fold mode and exhaustive Unfold mode during training, achieving 3x throughput on 48GB GPU while maintaining accuracy, with human-readable reasoning summaries.

Conclusion: Learned self-compression allows LLMs to tackle complex reasoning with minimal token overhead without quality loss, demonstrating effective reasoning context compression.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute via long Chain-ofThought unlocks remarkable gains in reasoning capabilities, yet it faces practical limits due to the linear growth of KV cache and quadratic attention complexity. In this paper, we introduce Accordion-Thinking, an end-to-end framework where LLMs learn to self-regulate the granularity of the reasoning steps through dynamic summarization. This mechanism enables a Fold inference mode, where the model periodically summarizes its thought process and discards former thoughts to reduce dependency on historical tokens. We apply reinforcement learning to incentivize this capability further, uncovering a critical insight: the accuracy gap between the highly efficient Fold mode and the exhaustive Unfold mode progressively narrows and eventually vanishes over the course of training. This phenomenon demonstrates that the model learns to encode essential reasoning information into compact summaries, achieving effective compression of the reasoning context. Our Accordion-Thinker demonstrates that with learned self-compression, LLMs can tackle complex reasoning tasks with minimal dependency token overhead without compromising solution quality, and it achieves a 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on a 48GB GPU memory configuration, while the structured step summaries provide a human-readable account of the reasoning process.

TL;DR: 本文提出CSR-Bench基准测试，通过四个压力测试模式评估16个先进多模态大模型，发现其安全行为主要依赖单模态捷径而非真正的联合意图理解，存在跨模态对齐差距、语言主导和安全意识薄弱等问题。

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的安全行为可能被单模态捷径驱动而非真正的联合意图理解，缺乏系统性的跨模态可靠性评估基准。

Method: 构建CSR-Bench基准，包含安全、过度拒绝、偏见和幻觉四种压力测试模式，61个细粒度类型，每个实例需要图文联合理解，并提供纯文本对照来诊断模态引起的行为变化。

Result: 评估16个先进MLLMs，发现系统性跨模态对齐差距、安全意识弱、干扰下语言主导性强、从文本到多模态输入性能持续下降，以及减少过度拒绝与安全非歧视行为之间存在明显权衡。

Conclusion: 多模态大模型的安全问题源于拒绝启发式而非鲁棒意图理解，减少过度拒绝与保持真正安全行为之间存在根本性权衡。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable interaction over both text and images, but their safety behavior can be driven by unimodal shortcuts instead of true joint intent understanding. We introduce CSR-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating cross-modal reliability through four stress-testing interaction patterns spanning Safety, Over-rejection, Bias, and Hallucination, covering 61 fine-grained types. Each instance is constructed to require integrated image-text interpretation, and we additionally provide paired text-only controls to diagnose modality-induced behavior shifts. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe systematic cross-modal alignment gaps. Models show weak safety awareness, strong language dominance under interference, and consistent performance degradation from text-only controls to multimodal inputs. We also observe a clear trade-off between reducing over-rejection and maintaining safe, non-discriminatory behavior, suggesting that some apparent safety gains may come from refusal-oriented heuristics rather than robust intent understanding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agentic Proposing, an AI agent framework that synthesizes high-quality, verifiable reasoning problems through dynamic skill composition and iterative reflection. Using Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization, they train a 4B model to generate training data that enables a 30B solver to achieve 91.6% on AIME25 with only 11K examples, rivaling GPT-5 and proving small volumes of high-quality synthetic data can replace massive human-curated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human annotation for complex reasoning datasets is prohibitively expensive and difficult to scale. Current synthesis methods face a fundamental trade-off: maintaining structural validity restricts problem complexity, while relaxing constraints to increase difficulty leads to inconsistent or unsolvable problems.

Method: Agentic Proposing framework that models problem synthesis as a goal-driven sequential decision process where a specialized agent dynamically selects and composes modular reasoning skills. Through iterative internal reflection and tool-use, they develop Agentic-Proposer-4B using Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization (MGPO) to generate high-precision, verifiable training trajectories across mathematics, coding, and science domains.

Result: Downstream solvers trained on agent-synthesized data significantly outperform leading baselines and show robust cross-domain generalization. A 30B solver trained on only 11,000 synthesized trajectories achieves state-of-the-art 91.6% accuracy on AIME2025, rivaling frontier-scale proprietary models like GPT-5.

Conclusion: The Agentic Proposing framework successfully resolves the scalability-quality trade-off in reasoning dataset creation, demonstrating that small volumes of high-quality synthetic data can effectively substitute for massive human-curated datasets and enable smaller models to achieve frontier-level reasoning performance.

Abstract: Advancing complex reasoning in large language models relies on high-quality, verifiable datasets, yet human annotation remains cost-prohibitive and difficult to scale. Current synthesis paradigms often face a recurring trade-off: maintaining structural validity typically restricts problem complexity, while relaxing constraints to increase difficulty frequently leads to inconsistent or unsolvable instances. To address this, we propose Agentic Proposing, a framework that models problem synthesis as a goal-driven sequential decision process where a specialized agent dynamically selects and composes modular reasoning skills. Through an iterative workflow of internal reflection and tool-use, we develop the Agentic-Proposer-4B using Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization (MGPO) to generate high-precision, verifiable training trajectories across mathematics, coding, and science. Empirical results demonstrate that downstream solvers trained on agent-synthesized data significantly outperform leading baselines and exhibit robust cross-domain generalization. Notably, a 30B solver trained on only 11,000 synthesized trajectories achieves a state-of-the-art 91.6% accuracy on AIME25, rivaling frontier-scale proprietary models such as GPT-5 and proving that a small volume of high-quality synthetic signals can effectively substitute for massive human-curated datasets.

Abstract: Enterprise meeting environments require AI assistants that handle diverse operational tasks, from rapid fact checking during live discussions to cross meeting analysis for strategic planning, under strict latency, cost, and privacy constraints. Existing meeting benchmarks mainly focus on simplified question answering and fail to reflect real world enterprise workflows, where queries arise organically from multi stakeholder collaboration, span long temporal contexts, and require tool augmented reasoning.
  We address this gap through a grounded dataset and a learned agent framework. First, we introduce MeetAll, a bilingual and multimodal corpus derived from 231 enterprise meetings totaling 140 hours. Questions are injected using an enterprise informed protocol validated by domain expert review and human discriminability studies. Unlike purely synthetic benchmarks, this protocol is grounded in four enterprise critical dimensions: cognitive load, temporal context span, domain expertise, and actionable task execution, calibrated through interviews with stakeholders across finance, healthcare, and technology sectors.
  Second, we propose MeetBench XL, a multi dimensional evaluation protocol aligned with human judgment that measures factual fidelity, intent alignment, response efficiency, structural clarity, and completeness. Third, we present MeetMaster XL, a learned dual policy agent that jointly optimizes query routing between fast and slow reasoning paths and tool invocation, including retrieval, cross meeting aggregation, and web search. A lightweight classifier enables accurate routing with minimal overhead, achieving a superior quality latency tradeoff over single model baselines. Experiments against commercial systems show consistent gains, supported by ablations, robustness tests, and a real world deployment case study.Resources: https://github.com/huyuelin/MeetBench.

### [34] [Rejecting Arguments Based on Doubt in Structured Bipolar Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03286)
*Michael A. Müller,Srdjan Vesic,Bruno Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出结构化双极论证框架(SBAFs)，通过纳入哲学和语言学视角改进计算论证模型，允许智能体基于怀疑理性拒绝论证，并关注句子层面的可接受性而非整体论证，提供了介于可采纳语义与完全语义之间的新语义体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算论证文献对哲学和语言学观点关注不足，特别是两个被忽视的重要思想：(1)智能体可基于单纯怀疑而理性拒绝论证，不必接受所有可辩护的论证；(2)在辩论中更自然的思考方式是关注智能体接受哪些单个句子或主张，而非哪些论证。

Method: 首先定义结构化双极论证框架(SBAFs)，其中论证由句子构成，并包含攻击和支持两种关系；然后提供新语义：(1)不强制智能体接受所有被辩护的论证；(2)除论证扩展外，还提供语言扩展来指定可接受的句子集合。

Result: 新语义位于抽象论证的可采纳语义与完全语义之间；可明确智能体何时能忽略论证间的支持关系（即何时适用抽象论证）；并证明演绎支持语义是本方法的一个特例。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将哲学洞见融入计算论证，提供了更灵活的辩论中智能体立场的建模方式，并能从新视角解释现有方法，具有较强的理论统一性和扩展性。

Abstract: This paper develops a new approach to computational argumentation that is informed by philosophical and linguistic views. Namely, it takes into account two ideas that have received little attention in the literature on computational argumentation: First, an agent may rationally reject an argument based on mere doubt, thus not all arguments they could defend must be accepted; and, second, that it is sometimes more natural to think in terms of which individual sentences or claims an agent accepts in a debate, rather than which arguments. In order to incorporate these two ideas into a computational approach, we first define the notion of structured bipolar argumentation frameworks (SBAFs), where arguments consist of sentences and we have both an attack and a support relation between them. Then, we provide semantics for SBAFs with two features: (1) Unlike with completeness-based semantics, our semantics do not force agents to accept all defended arguments. (2) In addition to argument extensions, which give acceptable sets of arguments, we also provide semantics for language extensions that specify acceptable sets of sentences. These semantics represent reasonable positions an agent might have in a debate. Our semantics lie between the admissible and complete semantics of abstract argumentation. Further, our approach can be used to provide a new perspective on existing approaches. For instance, we can specify the conditions under which an agent can ignore support between arguments (i.e. under which the use of abstract argumentation is warranted) and we show that deductive support semantics is a special case of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memora is a novel agent memory system that structurally balances abstraction and specificity using primary abstractions and cue anchors, with a retrieval policy that exploits memory connections beyond semantic similarity, achieving new SOTA on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agent memory systems must scale with growing information while supporting efficient retrieval, but abstraction for scaling often sacrifices the fine-grained details required for effective reasoning.

Method: Memora organizes memory via primary abstractions that index concrete values and consolidate updates, while cue anchors expand retrieval access and connect related memories. It employs a retrieval policy that actively exploits these connections beyond direct semantic similarity.

Result: Memora establishes new state-of-the-art performance on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks, demonstrating superior retrieval relevance and reasoning effectiveness, particularly as memory scales.

Conclusion: Theoretically, standard RAG and KG-based memory systems emerge as special cases of Memora, proving it provides a scalable, effective solution for agent memory that harmoniously balances abstraction and specificity.

Abstract: Agent memory systems must accommodate continuously growing information while supporting efficient, context-aware retrieval for downstream tasks. Abstraction is essential for scaling agent memory, yet it often comes at the cost of specificity, obscuring the fine-grained details required for effective reasoning. We introduce Memora, a harmonic memory representation that structurally balances abstraction and specificity. Memora organizes information via its primary abstractions that index concrete memory values and consolidate related updates into unified memory entries, while cue anchors expand retrieval access across diverse aspects of the memory and connect related memories. Building on this structure, we employ a retrieval policy that actively exploits these memory connections to retrieve relevant information beyond direct semantic similarity. Theoretically, we show that standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graph (KG)-based memory systems emerge as special cases of our framework. Empirically, Memora establishes a new state-of-the-art on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks, demonstrating better retrieval relevance and reasoning effectiveness as memory scales.

TL;DR: 研究人员创建了首个真实临床环境下的细粒度精神疾病诊断基准MentalDx Bench，发现现有LLM在疾病级诊断上表现不佳，尽管在粗粒度分类上表现良好。他们开发的140亿参数医学专用模型MentalSeek-Dx通过临床推理训练实现了最优性能。

Method: 构建包含712份精神科医生按ICD-11标准标注的EHR的MentalDx Bench，涵盖16个诊断类别的76种疾病；评估18个LLM；通过监督轨迹构建和课程强化学习开发MentalSeek-Dx，使其内化临床假设-演绎推理过程。

Result: 发现"范式错位"：LLM在粗粒度诊断分类上表现良好，但在疾病级诊断上系统性失败，揭示了基于模式建模与临床推理的差距。MentalSeek-Dx仅用140亿参数即达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了临床基础的精神疾病诊断框架，弥合了LLM能力与真实临床需求之间的鸿沟，为可靠的精神疾病诊断提供了新范式。

Abstract: Mental health disorders represent a burgeoning global public health challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in psychiatric assessment, their clinical utility is severely constrained by benchmarks that lack ecological validity and fine-grained diagnostic supervision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MentalDx Bench}, the first benchmark dedicated to disorder-level psychiatric diagnosis within real-world clinical settings. Comprising 712 de-identified electronic health records annotated by board-certified psychiatrists under ICD-11 guidelines, the benchmark covers 76 disorders across 16 diagnostic categories. Evaluation of 18 LLMs reveals a critical \textit{paradigm misalignment}: strong performance at coarse diagnostic categorization contrasts with systematic failure at disorder-level diagnosis, underscoring a gap between pattern-based modeling and clinical hypothetico-deductive reasoning. In response, we propose \textbf{MentalSeek-Dx}, a medical-specialized LLM trained to internalize this clinical reasoning process through supervised trajectory construction and curriculum-based reinforcement learning. Experiments on MentalDx Bench demonstrate that MentalSeek-Dx achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with only 14B parameters, establishing a clinically grounded framework for reliable psychiatric diagnosis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GFlowPO is a probabilistic prompt optimization method that uses GFlowNets and dynamic meta-prompt updates to efficiently search for high-quality prompts, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finding effective prompts for language models is critical but difficult due to the combinatorially large prompt space and sparse rewards from expensive LM evaluations. Existing RL-based methods suffer from poor sample efficiency.

Method: GFlowPO frames prompt search as posterior inference. First, it fine-tunes a lightweight prompt-LM using off-policy GFlowNet with replay-based training for sample-efficient exploration. Second, it applies Dynamic Memory Update (DMU) to adaptively refine the meta-prompt by incorporating diverse prompts from a replay buffer and top-performing prompts from a priority queue, concentrating search on high-reward regions.

Result: GFlowPO consistently outperforms recent discrete prompt optimization baselines across few-shot text classification, instruction induction benchmarks, and question answering tasks.

Conclusion: The GFlowPO framework effectively addresses sample efficiency in prompt optimization by combining GFlowNets with dynamic meta-prompt updating, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Finding effective prompts for language models (LMs) is critical yet notoriously difficult: the prompt space is combinatorially large, rewards are sparse due to expensive target-LM evaluation. Yet, existing RL-based prompt optimizers often rely on on-policy updates and a meta-prompt sampled from a fixed distribution, leading to poor sample efficiency. We propose GFlowPO, a probabilistic prompt optimization framework that casts prompt search as a posterior inference problem over latent prompts regularized by a meta-prompted reference-LM prior. In the first step, we fine-tune a lightweight prompt-LM with an off-policy Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) objective, using a replay-based training policy that reuses past prompt evaluations to enable sample-efficient exploration. In the second step, we introduce Dynamic Memory Update (DMU), a training-free mechanism that updates the meta-prompt by injecting both (i) diverse prompts from a replay buffer and (ii) top-performing prompts from a small priority queue, thereby progressively concentrating the search process on high-reward regions. Across few-shot text classification, instruction induction benchmarks, and question answering tasks, GFlowPO consistently outperforms recent discrete prompt optimization baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出RAI（风险感知注入），一种轻量级、无需训练的框架，通过构建不安全原型子空间并调制高风险视觉标记来放大不安全信号，在降低多模态越狱攻击成功率的同时保持模型效用。

Motivation: 视觉语言模型易受多模态越狱攻击，现有防御方法要么依赖安全微调导致训练成本高昂，要么采用激进标记操作严重损害模型效用。研究发现视觉输入会稀释大型语言模型天然具备的风险识别信号。

Method: RAI从语言嵌入构建不安全原型子空间，并对选定的高风险视觉标记进行定向调制，在跨模态特征空间中显式激活安全关键信号，恢复模型对视觉输入中不安全内容的识别能力。

Result: 在多个越狱攻击和效用基准测试上的广泛实验表明，RAI显著降低了攻击成功率，同时未损害任务性能。

Conclusion: RAI提供了一种有效的轻量级、无需训练的安全校准方案，在不牺牲效用的前提下增强了视觉语言模型对抗越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) extend the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to cross-modal settings, yet remain highly vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks. Existing defenses predominantly rely on safety fine-tuning or aggressive token manipulations, incurring substantial training costs or significantly degrading utility. Recent research shows that LLMs inherently recognize unsafe content in text, and the incorporation of visual inputs in VLMs frequently dilutes risk-related signals. Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance.

TL;DR: Proposes intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict models to overcome granularity limitations in three-way conflict analysis, with new measures, decision models, and adjustment strategies validated by example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical preference-based conflict models use only three qualitative relations (preference, converse, indifference), limiting their ability to capture nuanced conflict attitudes.

Method: Introduces intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situations, develops corresponding conflict measures, constructs three-way analysis models for agent/issue sets, uses relative loss functions for thresholds, and designs adjustment mechanism-based strategies with algorithm.

Result: Framework of intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict analysis with measures, three-way decision models, threshold calculation methods, and feasible adjustment strategies.

Conclusion: Illustrative example demonstrates the model's validity and effectiveness in addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: In three-way conflict analysis, preference-based conflict situations characterize agents' attitudes towards issues by formally modeling their preferences over pairs of issues. However, existing preference-based conflict models rely exclusively on three qualitative relations, namely, preference, converse, and indifference, to describe agents' attitudes towards issue pairs, which significantly limits their capacity in capturing the essence of conflict. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situation that captures agents' attitudes towards issue pairs with finer granularity than that afforded by classical preference-based models. Afterwards, we develop intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict measures within this framework, and construct three-way conflict analysis models for trisecting the set of agent pairs, the agent set, and the issue set. Additionally, relative loss functions built on the proposed conflict functions are employed to calculate thresholds for three-way conflict analysis. Finally, we present adjustment mechanism-based feasible strategies that simultaneously account for both adjustment magnitudes and conflict degrees, together with an algorithm for constructing such feasible strategies, and provide an illustrative example to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model.

*Tae Soo Kim,Yoonjoo Lee,Jaesang Yu,John Joon Young Chung,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiscoverLLM is a novel framework that trains LLMs to help users discover undefined intents through adaptive exploration and refinement, using a user simulator that models cognitive states with hierarchical intent concretization as a reward signal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs fail to handle ambiguous user requests where intents are unformed, as simple clarification questions are ineffective when users themselves don't know their needs. Users require collaborative exploration to discover their own intentions.

Method: Proposes DiscoverLLM framework with a novel user simulator modeling cognitive states via hierarchical intent concretization. Uses degree of concretization as reward signal to train models that adaptively diverge (explore options) when intents are unclear and converge (refine) when concretized.

Result: Achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40% across creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing benchmarks. User study with 75 participants shows improved conversation satisfaction and efficiency versus baselines.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables LLMs to collaboratively help users form intents through adaptive exploration-convergence strategies, demonstrating generalizability across domains and significant improvements in both performance and user experience.

Abstract: To handle ambiguous and open-ended requests, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to interact with users to surface intents they have not yet expressed (e.g., ask clarification questions). However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking "what kind of tone do you want?" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize. Across proposed interactive benchmarks in creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing, DiscoverLLM achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40%. In a user study with 75 human participants, DiscoverLLM improved conversation satisfaction and efficiency compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes CRL-VLA, a framework for continual reinforcement learning of Vision-Language-Action models that uses theoretical bounds and asymmetric regulation via a dual-critic architecture to balance stability (avoiding forgetting) and plasticity (learning new skills) in lifelong robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lifelong learning is critical for embodied agents, but existing methods struggle to balance stability (retaining old manipulation skills) and plasticity (acquiring new ones) when continuously fine-tuning VLA models through environmental interaction.

Method: CRL-VLA derives a unified performance bound linking stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude. It implements asymmetric regulation through a dual-critic architecture with a novel Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF): a frozen critic maintains semantic consistency on prior tasks while a trainable estimator drives adaptation to new tasks.

Result: Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show CRL-VLA effectively harmonizes stability and plasticity, outperforming baselines in both anti-forgetting (retaining old skills) and forward adaptation (learning new tasks).

Conclusion: CRL-VLA provides a theoretically-grounded solution for continual post-training of VLA models, successfully addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma in lifelong robotic learning through asymmetric regulation.

Abstract: Lifelong learning is critical for embodied agents in open-world environments, where reinforcement learning fine-tuning has emerged as an important paradigm to enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to master dexterous manipulation through environmental interaction. Thus, Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a promising pathway for deploying VLA models in lifelong robotic scenarios, yet balancing stability (retaining old skills) and plasticity (learning new ones) remains a formidable challenge for existing methods. We introduce CRL-VLA, a framework for continual post-training of VLA models with rigorous theoretical bounds. We derive a unified performance bound linking the stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude, scaled by policy divergence. CRL-VLA resolves this dilemma via asymmetric regulation: constraining advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks. This is realized through a simple but effective dual-critic architecture with novel Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF), where a frozen critic anchors semantic consistency and a trainable estimator drives adaptation. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that CRL-VLA effectively harmonizes these conflicting objectives, outperforming baselines in both anti-forgetting and forward adaptation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文通过ASP框架研究形式化抽象（删除和聚类）对人类理解和认知负荷的影响，实验表明聚类提升理解能力，删除降低认知负荷，证实抽象化可优化AI解释的人机交互效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统的输出难以理解，虽然符号AI具有透明性，但原始逻辑轨迹带来过高认知负荷，需要简化解释以提升人类认知效率。

Method: 采用答案集编程(ASP)作为形式化框架，定义无关细节进行抽象化处理，通过认知实验让参与者在不同领域分类任务中评估简化后的解释。

Result: 聚类细节显著提升参与者的理解表现，删除细节显著降低认知努力，两者均有效改善符号解释的可用性。

Conclusion: 抽象化技术（特别是聚类和删除）能够有效增强以人为中心的符号解释质量，支持了假设。

Abstract: Explanations are central to human cognition, yet AI systems often produce outputs that are difficult to understand. While symbolic AI offers a transparent foundation for interpretability, raw logical traces often impose a high extraneous cognitive load. We investigate how formal abstractions, specifically removal and clustering, impact human reasoning performance and cognitive effort. Utilizing Answer Set Programming (ASP) as a formal framework, we define a notion of irrelevant details to be abstracted over to obtain simplified explanations. Our cognitive experiments, in which participants classified stimuli across domains with explanations derived from an answer set program, show that clustering details significantly improve participants' understanding, while removal of details significantly reduce cognitive effort, supporting the hypothesis that abstraction enhances human-centered symbolic explanations.

*Haohao Luo,Zexi Li,Yuexiang Xie,Wenhao Zhang,Yaliang Li,Ying Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IntentRL is a reinforcement learning framework that trains proactive Deep Research agents to clarify latent user intents before conducting expensive, long-horizon research, solving the autonomy-interaction dilemma.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Research agents face an autonomy-interaction dilemma: high autonomy on ambiguous queries leads to prolonged execution with unsatisfactory outcomes, creating a need for proactive clarification to improve efficiency and quality.

Method: A two-stage RL strategy: Stage I learns general user-interaction behavior from offline dialogues generated via a scalable shallow-to-deep intent refinement graph pipeline; Stage II uses online rollouts with a user simulator to adapt to diverse feedback.

Result: Significantly improves intent hit rate and downstream task performance, outperforming built-in clarification modules of closed-source DR agents and proactive LLM baselines.

Conclusion: Proactive intent clarification through IntentRL effectively resolves the autonomy-interaction trade-off in Deep Research, making long-horizon research more efficient and user-satisfying.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents extend Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge by autonomously retrieving and synthesizing evidence from large web corpora into long-form reports, enabling a long-horizon agentic paradigm. However, unlike real-time conversational assistants, DR is computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating an autonomy-interaction dilemma: high autonomy on ambiguous user queries often leads to prolonged execution with unsatisfactory outcomes. To address this, we propose IntentRL, a framework that trains proactive agents to clarify latent user intents before starting long-horizon research. To overcome the scarcity of open-ended research data, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands a few seed samples into high-quality dialogue turns via a shallow-to-deep intent refinement graph. We further adopt a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: Stage I applies RL on offline dialogues to efficiently learn general user-interaction behavior, while Stage II uses the trained agent and a user simulator for online rollouts to strengthen adaptation to diverse user feedback. Extensive experiments show that IntentRL significantly improves both intent hit rate and downstream task performance, outperforming the built-in clarify modules of closed-source DR agents and proactive LLM baselines.

### [44] [When Routing Collapses: On the Degenerate Convergence of LLM Routers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03478)
*Guannan Lai,Han-Jia Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies "routing collapse" in LLM routers where systems unnecessarily default to expensive models, and proposes EquiRouter—a decision-aware ranking approach that reduces cost by 17% while maintaining GPT-4-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM routers systematically under-utilize small models even as cost budgets increase, wasting computation and monetary cost, which undermines the core promise of routing for achieving quality-cost trade-offs.

Method: Proposes EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings instead of predicting scalar performance scores, addressing the objective-decision mismatch where small prediction errors flip relative orderings.

Result: On RouterBench, EquiRouter reduces cost by approximately 17% at GPT-4-level performance compared to the strongest prior router.

Conclusion: By directly learning model rankings, EquiRouter mitigates routing collapse and restores the role of smaller models, achieving better cost efficiency and fulfilling the core promise of routing.

Abstract: LLM routing aims to achieve a favorable quality--cost trade-off by dynamically assigning easy queries to smaller models and harder queries to stronger ones. However, across both unimodal and multimodal settings, we uncover a pervasive yet underexplored failure mode in existing routers: as the user's cost budget increases, routers systematically default to the most capable and most expensive model even when cheaper models already suffice. As a result, current routers under-utilize small models, wasting computation and monetary cost and undermining the core promise of routing; we term this phenomenon routing collapse. We attribute routing collapse to an objective--decision mismatch: many routers are trained to predict scalar performance scores, whereas routing decisions ultimately depend on discrete comparisons among candidate models. Consequently, small prediction errors can flip relative orderings and trigger suboptimal selections. To bridge this gap, we propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings, restoring the role of smaller models and mitigating routing collapse. On RouterBench, EquiRouter reduces cost by about 17\% at GPT-4-level performance compared to the strongest prior router. Our code is available at https://github.com/AIGNLAI/EquiRouter.

TL;DR: 该论文使用基于主体的模型和进化博弈论，研究两种AI使用方式（补充型和替代型）对人类文化演化的长期影响，发现个体选择偏好AI替代导致文化多样性下降，而强群体边界下的群体选择可维持AI补充型以保护文化创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI依赖会减少文化变异性和多样性，导致模型崩溃和幻觉等问题，威胁人类创造性工作和文化演化进程，亟需研究其长期后果及应对策略。

Method: 采用基于主体的计算模型和进化博弈论框架，模拟AI-补充型（人类主导+AI建议）与AI-替代型（AI主导+人类少量输入）两种策略在个体选择和群体选择下的演化动态。

Result: 个体层面选择中，AI-替代型用户因短期效率优势占据主导，但会大幅降低文化方差；AI-补充型虽能维持群体探索所需的变异度，但仅在群体边界清晰、群体选择压力强时才能胜出。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI采用的人口层面长期效应，为保护文化多样性和制定缓解"文化崩溃"风险的组织和政策策略提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Reliance on generative AI can reduce cultural variance and diversity, especially in creative work. This reduction in variance has already led to problems in model performance, including model collapse and hallucination. In this paper, we examine the long-term consequences of AI use for human cultural evolution and the conditions under which widespread AI use may lead to "cultural collapse", a process in which reliance on AI-generated content reduces human variation and innovation and slows cumulative cultural evolution. Using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory, we compare two types of AI use: complement and substitute. AI-complement users seek suggestions and guidance while remaining the main producers of the final output, whereas AI-substitute users provide minimal input, and rely on AI to produce most of the output. We then study how these use strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics. We find that AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite the stronger reduction in cultural variance. By contrast, AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong. Overall, our findings shed light on the long-term, population-level effects of AI adoption and inform policy and organizational strategies to mitigate these risks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出"人物角色生成器"，通过基于AlphaEvolve的LLM进化优化迭代，生成能最大化行为覆盖范围而非仅复制常见行为的多样化合成人群，在稀有特征组合生成上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI与人类的交互需要理解多样化用户群体的行为，但收集真实人类数据成本高昂且常常不可行，尤其对于新技术或假设性未来场景。现有LLM模拟方法优先复制最可能行为（密度匹配）而非覆盖所有可能行为（支持覆盖），导致长尾行为探索不足。

Method: 基于AlphaEvolve开发迭代改进循环，将LLM作为变异算子，在数百次迭代中优化人物角色生成器代码。这些轻量级生成器能将简短描述自动扩展为沿相关多样性轴最大化覆盖意见和偏好的多样化合成人群。

Result: 在六个多样性指标上，进化后的生成器在保留上下文上的表现显著优于现有基线，能生成标准LLM输出难以实现的稀有特征组合人群。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI评估提供了可扩展的多样化合成人群创建方案，解决了长尾行为问题，为理解AI系统在假设场景中的行为提供了实用工具，无需昂贵的人类数据收集。

Abstract: Evaluating AI systems that interact with humans requires understanding their behavior across diverse user populations, but collecting representative human data is often expensive or infeasible, particularly for novel technologies or hypothetical future scenarios. Recent work in Generative Agent-Based Modeling has shown that large language models can simulate human-like synthetic personas with high fidelity, accurately reproducing the beliefs and behaviors of specific individuals. However, most approaches require detailed data about target populations and often prioritize density matching (replicating what is most probable) rather than support coverage (spanning what is possible), leaving long-tail behaviors underexplored. We introduce Persona Generators, functions that can produce diverse synthetic populations tailored to arbitrary contexts. We apply an iterative improvement loop based on AlphaEvolve, using large language models as mutation operators to refine our Persona Generator code over hundreds of iterations. The optimization process produces lightweight Persona Generators that can automatically expand small descriptions into populations of diverse synthetic personas that maximize coverage of opinions and preferences along relevant diversity axes. We demonstrate that evolved generators substantially outperform existing baselines across six diversity metrics on held-out contexts, producing populations that span rare trait combinations difficult to achieve in standard LLM outputs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle as medical world models due to error accumulation in sequential interventions. The paper introduces EHRWorld, a patient-centric model trained on a large causal longitudinal dataset (EHRWorld-110K), which significantly outperforms LLM baselines in stable long-horizon clinical simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models can simulate future states but are challenging in complex, high-stakes domains like medicine. LLMs excel at static medical reasoning but it's unclear if they can function as dynamic medical world models for simulating disease progression over time. Current LLMs struggle to maintain consistent patient states under sequential interventions, causing error accumulation.

Method: Introduced EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, along with EHRWorld-110K, a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records.

Result: EHRWorld significantly outperforms naive LLM-based baselines, achieving more stable long-horizon simulation, improved modeling of clinically sensitive events, and favorable reasoning efficiency.

Conclusion: The results highlight the necessity of training on causally grounded, temporally evolving clinical data for reliable and robust medical world modeling.

Abstract: World models offer a principled framework for simulating future states under interventions, but realizing such models in complex, high-stakes domains like medicine remains challenging. Recent large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on static medical reasoning tasks, raising the question of whether they can function as dynamic medical world models capable of simulating disease progression and treatment outcomes over time. In this work, we show that LLMs only incorporating medical knowledge struggle to maintain consistent patient states under sequential interventions, leading to error accumulation in long-horizon clinical simulation. To address this limitation, we introduce EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, together with EHRWorld-110K, a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EHRWorld significantly outperforms naive LLM-based baselines, achieving more stable long-horizon simulation, improved modeling of clinically sensitive events, and favorable reasoning efficiency, highlighting the necessity of training on causally grounded, temporally evolving clinical data for reliable and robust medical world modeling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs have improved dramatically in strategic planning for asteroid mining missions (scores nearly doubled to 17.2/26), but still fail at implementation due to unit errors and debugging issues, making them facilitators rather than autonomous engineers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the limits of current AI agents in autonomous multi-stage planning for high-dimensional, physically constrained environments, using the GTOC 12 asteroid mining challenge as a test case.

Method: Adapted MLE-Bench framework to orbital mechanics, deployed AIDE-based agent architecture for autonomous mission design, and used LLM-as-a-Judge with expert rubric to evaluate five strategic categories across models from GPT-4-Turbo to o3.

Result: Strategic viability scores nearly doubled in two years (9.3 to 17.2/26), but models show a critical strategy-execution gap: they understand concepts but fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging.

Conclusion: Current LLMs function as powerful domain facilitators with sufficient knowledge for space science tasks, but remain limited by an implementation barrier and are not yet fully autonomous engineers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in code generation and general reasoning, yet their capacity for autonomous multi-stage planning in high-dimensional, physically constrained environments remains an open research question. This study investigates the limits of current AI agents by evaluating them against the 12th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12), a complex astrodynamics challenge requiring the design of a large-scale asteroid mining campaign. We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an "LLM-as-a-Judge" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). However, we identify a critical capability gap between strategy and execution. While advanced models demonstrate sophisticated conceptual understanding, correctly framing objective functions and mission architectures, they consistently fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops. We conclude that, while current LLMs often demonstrate sufficient knowledge and intelligence to tackle space science tasks, they remain limited by an implementation barrier, functioning as powerful domain facilitators rather than fully autonomous engineers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Search-R2, an Actor-Refiner collaboration framework with dense hybrid rewards to solve multi-scale credit assignment in search-integrated reasoning agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training search-integrated reasoning agents via RL suffers from multi-scale credit assignment problem where sparse trajectory-level rewards cannot differentiate high-quality reasoning from fortuitous guesses, leading to inefficient search behaviors.

Method: Search-R2 decomposes generation into an Actor producing initial trajectories and a Meta-Refiner performing selective correction via 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism, with joint optimization using a hybrid reward combining outcome correctness and dense process reward based on evidence information density.

Result: Extensive experiments show Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL baselines across various QA datasets and model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The Actor-Refiner collaboration with fine-grained supervision effectively addresses the credit assignment challenge, and theoretical analysis proves selective correction provides strict performance gains over baselines.

Abstract: Search-integrated reasoning enables language agents to transcend static parametric knowledge by actively querying external sources. However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.

### [50] [Mitigating Conversational Inertia in Multi-Turn Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03664)
*Yang Wan,Zheng Cao,Zhenhao Zhang,Zhengwen Zeng,Shuheng Shen,Changhua Meng,Linchao Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discovers "conversational inertia" in LLMs where models inappropriately imitate their own previous responses in multiturn agent scenarios. It proposes Context Preference Learning to favor low-inertia responses and context management strategies to balance exploration vs exploitation, demonstrating performance gains across multiple agent environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel as few-shot learners, this strength becomes problematic in multiturn agent settings where they erroneously mimic their own prior responses, creating imitation bias that constrains exploration and undermines agent performance.

Method: Through attention analysis, the authors identify conversational inertia (strong diagonal attention to previous responses). They leverage that longer contexts produce stronger inertia to construct preference pairs without environment rewards, then propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate models toward low-inertia responses, plus inference-time context management strategies.

Result: Experiments across eight agentic environments and one deep research scenario show the framework effectively reduces conversational inertia and achieves measurable performance improvements.

Conclusion: Conversational inertia is a fundamental tension in LLM agents; the proposed Context Preference Learning successfully mitigates imitation bias while balancing exploration and exploitation, leading to better agent performance.

Abstract: Large language models excel as few-shot learners when provided with appropriate demonstrations, yet this strength becomes problematic in multiturn agent scenarios, where LLMs erroneously mimic their own previous responses as few-shot examples. Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results across eight agentic environments and one deep research scenario validate that our framework reduces conversational inertia and achieves performance improvements.

Conclusion: 任务导向的动态通信拓扑能有效提升多轮多智能体系统的适应性，为复杂场景下的LLM智能体协作提供新范式

Abstract: Multi-round LLM-based multi-agent systems rely on effective communication structures to support collaboration across rounds. However, most existing methods employ a fixed communication topology during inference, which falls short in many realistic applications where the agents' roles may change \textit{across rounds} due to dynamic adversary, task progression, or time-varying constraints such as communication bandwidth. In this paper, we propose addressing this issue through TodyComm, a \textbf{t}ask-\textbf{o}riented \textbf{dy}namic \textbf{comm}unication algorithm. It produces behavior-driven collaboration topologies that adapt to the dynamics at each round, optimizing the utility for the task through policy gradient. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that under both dynamic adversary and communications budgets, TodyComm delivers superior task effectiveness while retaining token efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Language agents have shown strong promise for task automation. Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient. Across three challenging benchmarks (GAIA, SWE-Bench, Terminal-Bench), AOrchestra achieves 16.28% relative improvement against the strongest baseline when paired with Gemini-3-Flash.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex tasks that are difficult for individual LLMs. A natural strategy is to scale performance by increasing the number of agents; however, we find that such scaling exhibits strong diminishing returns in homogeneous settings, while introducing heterogeneity (e.g., different models, prompts, or tools) continues to yield substantial gains. This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents. Our results provide principled guidelines for building efficient and robust MAS through diversity-aware design.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) enable test-time scaling, with dataset-level accuracy improving as the token budget increases, motivating adaptive reasoning -- spending tokens when they improve reliability and stopping early when additional computation is unlikely to help. However, setting the token budget, as well as the threshold for adaptive reasoning, is a practical challenge that entails a fundamental risk-accuracy trade-off. We re-frame the budget setting problem as risk control, limiting the error rate while minimizing compute. Our framework introduces an upper threshold that stops reasoning when the model is confident (risking incorrect output) and a novel parametric lower threshold that preemptively stops unsolvable instances (risking premature stoppage). Given a target risk and a validation set, we use distribution-free risk control to optimally specify these stopping mechanisms. For scenarios with multiple budget controlling criteria, we incorporate an efficiency loss to select the most computationally efficient exiting mechanism. Empirical results across diverse reasoning tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness of our risk control approach, demonstrating computational efficiency gains from the lower threshold and ensemble stopping mechanisms while adhering to the user-specified risk target.

Abstract: High-quality scientific illustrations are crucial for effectively communicating complex scientific and technical concepts, yet their manual creation remains a well-recognized bottleneck in both academia and industry. We present FigureBench, the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts. It contains 3,300 high-quality scientific text-figure pairs, covering diverse text-to-illustration tasks from scientific papers, surveys, blogs, and textbooks. Moreover, we propose AutoFigure, the first agentic framework that automatically generates high-quality scientific illustrations based on long-form scientific text. Specifically, before rendering the final result, AutoFigure engages in extensive thinking, recombination, and validation to produce a layout that is both structurally sound and aesthetically refined, outputting a scientific illustration that achieves both structural completeness and aesthetic appeal. Leveraging the high-quality data from FigureBench, we conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of AutoFigure against various baseline methods. The results demonstrate that AutoFigure consistently surpasses all baseline methods, producing publication-ready scientific illustrations. The code, dataset and huggingface space are released in https://github.com/ResearAI/AutoFigure.

*Pavel Orlov,Enej Ilievski*

TL;DR: 研究经典孤立系统热化机制，提出有效局域遍历性替代全局遍历性，建立经典本征态热化假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典统计力学热化通常需要全局遍历性假设，但在局域相互作用系统中这一要求可能过于严格，需要新的理论基础。

Method: 通过分析幺正演化算符的谱特性，在算符本征函数基底下提出描述局域观测量统计性质的ansatz。

Result: 证实热化源于有效局域遍历性而非全局遍历性，建立了经典本征态热化假说，连通了经典与量子热化理论。

Conclusion: 该工作为离散谱经典和量子系统的热化提供了统一框架，深化了对统计力学涌现现象的理解。

Abstract: We study the emergence of statistical mechanics in isolated classical systems with local interactions and discrete phase spaces. We establish that thermalization in such systems does not require global ergodicity; instead, it arises from effective local ergodicity, where dynamics in a subsystem may appear pseudorandom. To corroborate that, we analyze the spectrum of the unitary evolution operator and propose an ansatz to describe statistical properties of local observables expanded in the eigenfunction basis - the classical counterpart of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. Our framework provides a unified perspective on thermalization in classical and quantum systems with discrete spectra.

### [57] [Quantum phase transition in transverse-field Ising model on Sierpiński gasket lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02904)
*Tymoteusz Braciszewski,Oliwier Urbański,Piotr Tomczak*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper investigates quantum phase transitions in the transverse-field Ising model on the Sierpiński gasket fractal, revealing unique critical exponents distinct from regular 1D and mean-field systems due to fractal geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how fractal geometry (specifically the Sierpiński gasket) influences quantum phase transitions, as critical behavior in such non-regular structures remains unexplored compared to standard lattices.

Method: Combined finite-size scaling analysis and numerical renormalization group methods, first validated on the exactly solvable 1D chain, then applied to Sierpiński gasket systems with 11 and 15 spins.

Result: Identified a quantum critical point at λ_c ≈ 2.72–2.93 with critical exponents z≈0.84, ν≈1.12, β≈0.30, γ≈2.54. The low z value indicates slowed quantum fluctuations, yielding an effective critical dimension of ~2.43. Renormalization group results (λ_c=2.765, β=0.306) confirmed these findings.

Conclusion: Fractal geometry fundamentally alters quantum critical behavior, producing exponents intermediate between 1D and mean-field universality classes, demonstrating that geometric disorder significantly impacts quantum phase transitions.

Abstract: We study quantum phase transition in the transverse-field Ising model on the Sierpiński gasket. By applying finite-size scaling and numerical renormalization group methods, we determine the critical coupling and the exponents that describe this transition. We first checked our finite-size scaling and the renormalization methods on the exactly solvable one-dimensional chain, where we recovered proper values of critical couplings and exponents. Then, we applied the method to the Sierpiński gasket with 11 and 15 spins. We found a quantum critical point at $λ_c \approx 2.72$ to $2.93$, with critical exponents $z\approx0.84$, $ν\approx 1.12 $, $β\approx 0.30$, and $γ\approx 2.54$. The lower dynamical exponent $z$ indicates that quantum fluctuations slow down due to fractal geometry, yielding an effective critical dimension of about 2.43. The numerical renormalization group method yielded similar results $λ_c = 2.765$, $β= 0.306$, supporting our findings. These exponents differ from those in both the one-dimensional and mean-field cases.

TL;DR: 研究者通过数值模拟一维分数阶哈密顿Potts模型，在稳态热传导条件下观察到了相共存现象，发现界面温度偏离平衡相变温度，违反了局部平衡假设，证实了非平衡相变中稳定亚稳态的存在。

Motivation: 研究非平衡态相共存现象，特别是第一级相变在非平衡条件下的行为，希望在一个简化的一维模型中重现通常需要二维系统才能出现的相共存结构。

Method: 构建一个含分数阶空间导数的一维哈密顿-Potts模型，通过边界热浴施加恒定热流，进行数值模拟研究。

Result: 观察到有序相和无序相通过静止界面稳定共存；界面温度系统性偏离平衡相变温度，违反局部平衡描述；该温度与全局热力学理论预测定量吻合；稳态热流可以稳定和控制亚稳态。

Conclusion: 局部平衡失效和亚稳态稳定化是非平衡第一级相变的内在特征，与空间维度无关；该模型为探索非平衡稳态中热力学描述的基本极限提供了最小可控的数值平台。

Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium phase coexistence associated with a first-order phase transition by numerically studying a one-dimensional Hamiltonian-Potts model with fractional spatial derivatives. The fractional derivative is introduced so as to reproduce the low-wavenumber density of states of the standard two-dimensional model, allowing phase coexistence to occur in a minimal one-dimensional setting under steady heat conduction. By imposing a constant heat flux through boundary heat baths, we observe stable coexistence of ordered and disordered phases separated by a stationary interface. We find that the temperature at the interface systematically deviates from the equilibrium transition temperature, demonstrating a clear violation of the local equilibrium description. This deviation indicates that equilibrium metastable states can be stabilized and controlled by a steady heat current. Furthermore, the interface temperature obtained in our simulations is in quantitative agreement with the prediction of global thermodynamics for non-equilibrium steady states. These results confirm that the breakdown of local equilibrium and the stabilization of metastable states are intrinsic features of non-equilibrium first-order phase transitions, independent of spatial dimensionality. Our study thus provides a minimal and controlled numerical model for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamic descriptions in non-equilibrium steady states.

TL;DR: This paper explores quantum spin chains with hidden free fermionic structures, connecting their underlying algebras to graph-Clifford/quasi-Clifford algebras, introducing a defining representation that matches Hamiltonian terms in specific models, and demonstrating a model-independent framework for anti-symmetric Hamiltonian combinations with reference states and few-body eigenstates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the algebraic structures underlying quantum spin chains that are solvable through hidden free fermionic constructions, and to develop a general framework for analyzing anti-symmetric combinations of commuting Hamiltonians with special eigenstate properties.

Method: Studying algebras associated with hidden free fermionic structures; establishing mathematical connections to graph-Clifford/quasi-Clifford algebras; introducing a "defining representation" concept; analyzing anti-symmetric combinations of commuting Hamiltonians in a model-independent way; constructing reference states and few-body eigenstates using fermionic operators.

Result: The defining representation of these algebras coincides with Hamiltonian terms in the XY model and Fendley's "free fermions in disguise" model; for anti-symmetric combinations of commuting Hamiltonians, there exists a reference state and few-body eigenstates that can be created by fermionic operators; concrete application demonstrated in the "free fermions in disguise" model.

Conclusion: The work establishes a connection between solvable quantum spin chains and graph-Clifford/quasi-Clifford algebras, provides a unified framework for understanding hidden free fermionic structures, and shows that specific Hamiltonian combinations possess a rich structure of exact eigenstates that can be constructed systematically.

Abstract: We study quantum spin chains solvable via hidden free fermionic structures. We study the algebras behind such models, establishing connections to the mathematical literature of the so-called ``graph-Clifford'' or ``quasi-Clifford'' algebras. We also introduce the ``defining representation'' for such algebras, and show that this representation actually coincides with the terms of the Hamiltonian in two relevant models: the XY model and the ``free fermions in disguise'' model of Fendley. Afterwards we study a particular anti-symmetric combination of commuting Hamiltonians; this is performed in a model independent way. We show that for this combination there exists a reference state, and few body eigenstates can be created by the fermionic operators. Concrete application is presented in the case of the ``free fermions in disguise'' model.

Conclusion: 该框架成功描述量子环境作为动态浴时的热力学行为，为半经典系统的非平衡热力学提供理论基础

Abstract: Quantum-Induced Stochastic Dynamics arises from the coupling between a classical system and a quantum environment. Unlike standard thermal reservoirs, this environment acts as a dynamic bath, capable of simultaneously exchanging heat and performing work. We formulate a thermodynamic framework for this semi-classical regime, defining heat, work, and entropy production. We derive a modified Second Law that accounts for non-equilibrium quantum features, such as squeezing. The framework is exemplified by an optomechanical setup, where we characterize the thermodynamics of the non-stationary noise induced by the cavity field.

TL;DR: 研究通过引入笛卡尔协议（三储热池方案）和时间延迟牛顿冷却定律，分析直接与逆向姆潘巴效应，推导出瞬时淬火下效应存在的精确条件，发现最大效应出现在等待时间等于延迟时间时，但相比双储热池方案效应强度更小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清姆潘巴效应（热水比冷水更快冷却）的物理机制，通过新协议分离关键参数（延迟时间、等待时间、温度），提供可量化异常热松弛的透明框架。

Method: 采用时间延迟牛顿冷却定律，设计三储热池的笛卡尔协议进行单步淬火实验，解析推导瞬时淬火下效应存在的温度边界、最优温度点及最大效应强度近似公式，并与双储热池方案对比，扩展至有限速率淬火分析。

Result: 1. 瞬时淬火下获得效应存在的精确温度边界条件；2. 效应最大时存在特定最优温度 ω̃(t_w)，且绝对最大值在 t_w=τ 时达到；3. 笛卡尔协议的最大效应强度小于双储热池方案；4. 有限速率淬火下严格条件无法产生真实效应，但短浴时间尺度下近似效应仍存在。

Conclusion: 建立的框架可统一解析多步热协议中的异常热弛豫现象，揭示参数分离对效应的影响，为其他热协议研究提供可直接应用的解析工具。

Abstract: We investigate the direct and inverse Mpemba effects within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling by introducing and analyzing the Descartes protocol, a three-reservoir thermal scheme in which each sample undergoes a single-step quench at different times. This protocol enables a transparent separation of the roles of the delay time $τ$, the waiting time $t_{\text{w}}$, and the normalized warm temperature $ω$, thus providing a flexible setting to characterize anomalous thermal relaxation. For instantaneous quenches, exact conditions for the existence of the Mpemba effect are obtained as bounds on $ω$ for given $τ$ and $t_{\text{w}}$. Within those bounds, the effect becomes maximal at a specific value $ω=\widetildeω(t_{\text{w}})$, and its magnitude is quantified by the extremal value of the temperature-difference function at this optimum. Accurate and compact approximations for both $\widetildeω(t_{\text{w}})$ and the maximal magnitude $\text{Mp}(t_{\text{w}})$ are derived, showing in particular that the absolute maximum at fixed $τ$ is reached for $t_{\text{w}}=τ$. A comparison with a previously studied two-reservoir protocol reveals that, despite its additional control parameter, the Descartes protocol yields a smaller maximal magnitude of the effect. The analysis is extended to finite-rate quenches, where strict equality of bath conditions prevents a genuine Mpemba effect, although an approximate one survives when the bath time scale is sufficiently short. The developed framework offers a unified and analytically tractable approach that can be readily applied to other multi-step thermal protocols.

TL;DR: 研究弱无序方格晶格中首通渗流的最优路径（测地线）的选定链路时间（SLTs）的统计特性，揭示其与KPZ普适类的关联，包括幂律衰减、长程相关性及Tracy-Widom分布替代中心极限定理的现象。


<details>

Motivation: 探究弱无序系统中测地线的选定链路时间（SLTs）的普适统计行为，特别是其与KPZ普适类的关联，以及路径方向性（对角/轴向）对统计特性的影响。

Method: 基于弱无序方格晶格模型，分析测地线中SLTs的平均值、标准差的幂律衰减行为，研究长程相关性，并比较对角与轴向路径的分布差异。

Result: 发现SLTs的平均值和标准差随端点距离呈KPZ普适类相关的幂律衰减；对角与轴向路径因测地线方向性（有向/无向）导致分布显著不同；SLT和违反中心极限定理，服从KPZ类的Tracy-Widom分布。

Conclusion: SLTs的统计特性（幂律衰减、长程相关性、Tracy-Widom分布）为KPZ普适类提供了新证据，路径方向性是导致分布差异的关键，表明高阶长程相关性的存在。

Abstract: In the context of first-passage percolation (FPP), we investigate the statistical properties of the selected link-times (SLTs) -the random link times comprising the optimal paths (or geodesics) connecting two given points. We focus on weakly disordered square lattices, whose geodesics are known to fall under the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Our analysis reveals universal power-law decays with the end-to-end distance for both the average and standard deviation of the SLTs, along with an intricate pattern of long-range correlations, whose scaling exponents are directly linked to KPZ universality. Crucially, the SLT distributions for diagonal and axial paths exhibit significant differences, which we trace back to the distinct directed and undirected nature, respectively, of the underlying geodesics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the SLT distribution violates the conditions of the central limit theorem. Instead, SLT sums follow the Tracy-Widom distribution characteristic of the KPZ class, which we associate with evidence for the emergence of high-order long-range correlations in the ensemble.

Abstract: Conformal invariance often accompanies criticality in Hermitian systems. However, its fate in non-Hermitian settings is less clear, especially near exceptional points where the Hamiltonian becomes non-diagonalizable. Here we investigate whether a 1+1-dimensional gapless non-Hermitian system can admit a conformal description, focusing on a PT-symmetric free-fermion field theory. Working in the biorthogonal formalism, we identify the conformal structure of this theory by constructing a traceless energy-momentum tensor whose Fourier modes generate a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c=-2$. This yields a non-Hermitian, biorthogonal realization of a logarithmic conformal field theory, in which correlation functions exhibit logarithmic scaling and the spectrum forms Virasoro staggered modules that are characterized by universal indecomposability parameters. We further present a microscopic construction and show how the same conformal data (with finite-size corrections) can be extracted from the lattice model at exceptional-point criticality, thereby supporting the field-theory prediction.

*Luciano Loris Viteritti,Riccardo Rende,Subir Sachdev,Giuseppe Carleo*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A Spatial Attention mechanism is introduced as a minimal inductive bias for Neural-Network Quantum States, enabling highly accurate simulations of strongly correlated quantum systems on unprecedentedly large lattices (up to 42×42 sites). Applied to the triangular-lattice Heisenberg model, it achieves state-of-the-art results, revealing significantly reduced magnetization and providing evidence that the sign problem is intrinsically non-local.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accessing thermodynamic-limit properties of strongly correlated quantum matter requires simulations on very large lattices, which remains challenging for existing numerical methods, especially in frustrated two-dimensional systems where traditional approaches struggle with scalability and optimization stability.

Method: The authors implement a Spatial Attention mechanism as a single learned length scale within the Transformer architecture for Neural-Network Quantum States, integrated into the Variational Monte Carlo framework. This minimal, physically interpretable inductive bias stabilizes large-scale optimization and enables accurate simulations on much larger system sizes than previously possible.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results for the spin-½ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet on clusters up to 42×42 sites, with thermodynamic limit energies systematically better than tensor-network approaches (iPEPS). Key findings include: magnetization M₀=0.148(1) (30% of classical value), revealing that less accurate variational states systematically overestimate magnetic order; extraction of experimentally relevant quantities through controlled finite-size scaling; and wave function analysis suggesting an intrinsically non-local sign structure. The method also outperforms Residual Convolutional Neural Networks for the J₁-J₂ model on a 20×20 square lattice.

Conclusion: The Spatial Attention mechanism provides a general and powerful approach for simulating large-scale quantum many-body systems, enabling access to thermodynamic-limit physics and revealing fundamental properties of frustrated magnets. The work demonstrates that the sign problem cannot be removed by local basis transformations and establishes NQS with attention as a leading method for strongly correlated systems.

Abstract: Accessing the thermodynamic-limit properties of strongly correlated quantum matter requires simulations on very large lattices, a regime that remains challenging for numerical methods, especially in frustrated two-dimensional systems. We introduce the Spatial Attention mechanism, a minimal and physically interpretable inductive bias for Neural-Network Quantum States, implemented as a single learned length scale within the Transformer architecture. This bias stabilizes large-scale optimization and enables access to thermodynamic-limit physics through highly accurate simulations on unprecedented system sizes within the Variational Monte Carlo framework. Applied to the spin-$\tfrac12$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on clusters of up to $42\times42$ sites. The ability to simulate such large systems allows controlled finite-size scaling of energies and order parameters, enabling the extraction of experimentally relevant quantities such as spin-wave velocities and uniform susceptibilities. In turn, we find extrapolated thermodynamic limit energies systematically better than those obtained with tensor-network approaches such as iPEPS. The resulting magnetization is strongly renormalized, $M_0=0.148(1)$ (about $30\%$ of the classical value), revealing that less accurate variational states systematically overestimate magnetic order. Analysis of the optimized wave function further suggests an intrinsically non-local sign structure, indicating that the sign problem cannot be removed by local basis transformations. We finally demonstrate the generality of the method by obtaining state-of-the-art energies for a $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a $20\times20$ square lattice, outperforming Residual Convolutional Neural Networks.

Abstract: We develop an efficient package for the simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance spin echo experiments to study the effects of strong electronic spin correlations on the dynamics of the nuclear spin ensemble. A mean-field model is used to study correlated electronic phases through their hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins. We explore the dynamics of the interacting nuclear ensemble and discuss the key behaviors of the system. In particular, we classify the types of temporal asymmetry that the interaction induces in the system as well as a pulse-dependent shift in the spectral domain. Us- ing these results, we discuss how careful measurement of the pulse-dependent shiftcanbeusedtoextractinformationabouttheanisotropyoftheelectronic interaction and how these results represent a novel tool for the examination of exotic NMR signatures in strongly correlated materials. Finally, we re- view specific aspects of the simulation package developed for our exploration and give explicit examples where package can be used to infer range and anisotropy of electronic correlations. In particular, we discuss its structure, accuracy, and the technical merits of the various approximations used to model the nuclear spin ensemble.

Abstract: Although second harmonic generation (SHG) is a promising and widely used method recently for studying 2D magnetic materials, the quantitative analysis of the full SHG tensor is currently challenging. In this letter, we describe a first-principles-based approach towards quantitative analysis of SHG in insulating magnets through formulation in terms of dynamical effective operators. These operators are computed by solving local many-body cluster models. We benchmark this method on NiI$_2$, a multiferroic 2D van der Waals antiferromagnet, demonstrating quantitative analysis of reported Rotational Anisotropy (RA)-SHG data. SHG is demonstrated to probe local ring-current susceptibilities, which provide sensitivity to short-range chiral spin-spin correlations. The described methods may be easily extended to other non-linear optical responses and materials.

Abstract: We report on the single crystal growth of Eu(Pd$_{1-x}$Au$_x$)$_2$Si$_2$, $0< x\leq 0.2$, from a levitating Eu-rich melt using the Czochralski method. Our structural analysis of the samples confirms the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type structure as well as an increase of the room temperature $a$ and $c$ lattice parameters with increasing $x$. Chemical analysis reveals that, depending on the Au concentration, only about 25-35\% of the amount of Au available in the initial melt is incorporated into the crystal structure, resulting in a decreasing substitution level for increasing $x$. Through Au substitution, chemical pressure is applied and large changes in valence crossover temperatures are already observed for low substitution levels $x$. In contrast to previous studies, we do not find any signs of a first-order transition in samples with $x_{\rm nom}=0.1$ or AFM order for higher $x$. Furthermore, we observe the formation of quarternary side phases for a higher amount of Au in the melt.
  In addition, cubic-mm-sized single crystals of EuPd$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ with $x_{\rm nom}=0.2$ were grown. The analysis of the X-ray fluorescence revealed that the crystals exhibit a slight variation in the Ge content. Such tiny compositional changes can cause changes in the sample properties concerning variations of the crossover temperature or changes of the type of the transition from crossover to magnetic order. Furthermore, we report on a new orthorhombic phase EuPd$_{1.42}$Si$_{1.27}$Ge$_{0.31}$ that orders antiferromagnetically below $17\,\rm K$.

Abstract: Magnetic memory and logic devices, including prospective ones based on skyrmions, inevitably produce heat. Thus, controlling heat flow is essential for their performance. Here we study how non-collinear spin arrangement affects the magnon contribution to thermal conductivity. As a paradigm system, we consider the most basic non-collinear magnet with a spin spiral ground state. Spin noncollinearity leads to anharmonic terms, resulting in magnon fusion and decay processes. These processes determine the magnon lifetime, which can be used to estimate thermal conductivity in a single-mode approximation. However, by solving the full Boltzmann equation numerically, we find a much higher thermal conductivity. This signifies that heat is carried not by individual magnons but by their linear combinations -- relaxons. The thermal conductivity is found to increase with the diminishing spiral pitch, consistent with recent experiments. The results provide the blueprint for calculating magnetic thermal transport in non-collinear magnets.

TL;DR: 首次通过μ-ARPES在Mott绝缘体NiPS₃中观测到强关联效应特征，发现价带边缘存在DFT+U计算未预测的弱色散特征，证实其为Ni-S配体混合多重态结构，揭示二维量子材料需超越平均场理论的量子多体描述


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前双粒子光谱学已在NiPS₃中观测到强关联特征（如原子-配体多重态和自旋-轨道激子），但光电子能谱（ARPES）中从未检测到，需填补单粒子光谱学观测空白

Method: 采用微区角分辨光电子能谱（μ-ARPES）测量NiPS₃，结合NiS₆团簇的精确对角化计算，分析价带边缘特征并与DFT+U计算结果对比

Result: 实验发现价带边缘存在弱色散特征，该特征不被DFT+U计算预测且不受Néel相变影响；团簇计算表明该特征源于d⁷与d⁸L混合多重态的低能末态构型，能量差与观测结果一致

Conclusion: NiPS₃中强关联、低维度和共价键合共同塑造光谱特性，证实ARPES可直接探测局域Ni-S多重态物理，强调二维量子材料需真正的量子多体理论描述

Abstract: We present $μ$-ARPES spectra of the Mott-insulating van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$. Signatures of strong correlations- such as the onset of atomic or atomic-ligand multiplets and spin-orbit-entangled exciton have been observed in this material by various two-particle spectroscopies, but not previously in photoemission. Our measurements reveal a weakly dispersive feature at the valence-band edge that is absent in DFT+$U$ calculations and remains unchanged across the Néel transition. After critically examining and ruling out alternative interpretations, we show that an exact diagonalization of a NiS$_6$ cluster yields low-energy final-state configurations of mixed multiplet $d^7$ and $d^8\underline{L}$ character, whose energy differences are consistent with the observed additional feature. This implies that ARPES directly accesses local Ni-S multiplet physics in NiPS$_3$, revealing a many-body structure beyond mean-field theory. Our results confirm that NiPS$_3$ is an excellent model platform in which strong correlations, reduced dimensionality, and covalent metal-ligand bonding jointly shape both two- and single-particle spectroscopies, underscoring the need for a genuinely quantum many-body description of two-dimensional quantum materials.

Motivation: 石墨烯晶格上Dirac费米子与电子关联的相互作用承载着一个从半金属到Mott绝缘体的基本量子相变，由Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg (GNH)普适类支配。然而，由于数值模拟中严重的有限尺寸效应以及缺乏共形自举基准，其精确临界指数仍存在长期争议，亟需高精度计算来解决这一根本问题。

Abstract: The interplay between Dirac fermions and electronic correlations on the honeycomb lattice hosts a fundamental quantum phase transition from a semimetal to a Mott insulator, governed by the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg (GNH) universality class. Despite its importance, consensus on the precise critical exponents remains elusive due to severe finite-size effects in numerical simulations and the lack of conformal bootstrap benchmarks. Here we try to resolve this long-standing controversy by performing projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations on lattices of unprecedented size, reaching 10,368 sites. By developing a novel projected submatrix update algorithm, we achieve a significant algorithmic speedup that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit with high precision. We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension and the correlation length exponent converge rapidly, while the boson anomalous dimension exhibits a systematic size dependence that we resolve via linear extrapolation. To validate our analysis, we perform parallel large-scale simulations of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice, which belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Ising class. Our results for the $t$-$V$ model, including the first QMC determination of the fermion anomalous dimension, show agreement with conformal bootstrap predictions, thereby corroborating the robustness of our methodology. Our work provides state-of-the-art critical exponents for the honeycomb Hubbard model and establishes a systematic finite-size scaling workflow applicable to a broad class of strongly correlated quantum systems, paving the way for resolving other challenging fermionic quantum critical phenomena.

Abstract: The interplay among orbital-selective Mott physics, Hund's coupling, tunable structural motifs, and Kondo-like scattering establishes a compelling paradigm for understanding and engineering correlated multi-orbital systems, as vividly exemplified by nickelate superconductors. Here, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic properties of trilayer nickelates. In La4Ni3O10, we observe pronounced interorbital hybridization, whereas in Pr4Ni3O10, the flat d_(z^2 ) band becomes markedly incoherent and diminishes in spectral weight. By contrast, the dispersive d_(x^2-y^2 ) bands retain coherence in both compounds. This striking incoherence/coherence dichotomy identifies an orbital-selective Mott phase modulated by the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bonding angle. The depletion of the d_(z^2 ) orbitals further frustrates the interorbital hybridization and influences the density-wave transition in Pr4Ni3O10. Moreover, the density-wave gap is substantially reduced in Pr4Ni3O10, likely due to extra scattering channels provided by the local moments of Pr3+ cations. Our findings elucidate the intricate interplay among lattice, orbital, spin, and electronic degrees of freedom and reveal a feasible structural control parameter for the multi-orbital correlated state in trilayer nickelates, which provide a concrete framework for understanding the emergence of superconductivity under high pressure.

Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-pumped two-dimensional spinless Holstein model within a semiclassical framework, focusing on the melting and recovery of long-range charge-density-wave order. Accurately describing this process requires fully nonadiabatic electron-lattice dynamics, which is computationally demanding due to the need to resolve fast electronic motion over long time scales. By analyzing the structure of the lattice force during nonequilibrium evolution, we show that the force naturally separates into a smooth quasi-adiabatic component and a residual bath-like contribution associated with fast electronic fluctuations. The quasi-adiabatic component depends only on the instantaneous local lattice configuration and can be efficiently learned using machine-learning techniques, while a minimal Langevin description of the bath term captures the essential features of the recovery dynamics. Combining these elements enables efficient and scalable simulations of long-time nonequilibrium dynamics on large lattices, providing a practical route to access driven correlated systems beyond the reach of direct nonadiabatic approaches.

Abstract: Dynamical properties are notoriously difficult to compute in numerical treatments of the Fermi-Hubbard model, especially in two spatial dimensions. However, they are essential in providing us with insight into some of the most important and less well-understood phases of the model, such as the pseudogap and strange metal phases at relatively high temperatures, or unconventional superconductivity at lower temperatures, away from the commensurate filling. Here, we use the numerical linked-cluster expansions to compute spin and charge optical conductivities of the model at different temperatures and strong interaction strengths via the exact real-time-dependent correlation functions of the current operators. We mitigate systematic errors associated with having a limited access to the long-time behavior of the correlators by introducing fits and allowing for non-zero Drude weights when appropriate. We compare our results to available data from optical lattice experiments and find that the Drude contributions can account for the theory-experiment gap in the DC spin conductivity of the model at half filling in the strong-coupling region. Our method helps paint a more complete picture of the conductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model and opens the door to studying dynamical properties of quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit.

Motivation: 传统的两站点DMFT近似无法解析关键光谱特征，需要发展适用于近期量子硬件的大浴离散化VQE方法，将杂化DMFT扩展到超越两站点近似，特别是描述绝缘相。

Result: 四站点模型基态能量相对误差低于0.01%（参数Np≤30）；在中间到强相互作用区，格林函数精度良好；但在弱相互作用区，格林函数与精确解存在明显偏差，尤其在低能谱特征方面，尽管基态能量仍保持高精度。

Conclusion: VQE结合实时演化可有效扩展DMFT超越两站点近似，为近期量子设备模拟强关联材料提供可行路径；但基态能量准确不能保证动力学性质准确，这是应用于关联金属体系的关键挑战。

Abstract: We present a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach for solving the Anderson Impurity Model (AIM) arising in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). Recognizing that the minimal two-site approximation often fails to resolve essential spectral features, we investigate the efficacy of VQE for larger bath discretizations while adhering to near-term hardware constraints. We employ a symmetry-adapted ansatz enforcing conservation of particle number $(N)$, spin projection $(S_z=0)$, and total spin $(S^2=0)$ symmetry, benchmarking the performance against exact diagonalization across different interaction strengths using bath parameters extracted from the DMFT self-consistency loop. For a four-site model, the relative error in the ground state energy remains well below $0.01%$ with a compact parameter set $(N_p \le 30)$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the single-particle Green's function-the central quantity for DMFT-can be accurately extracted from VQE-prepared ground states via real-time evolution in the intermediate to strong interaction regimes. However, in the weak interaction regime, the Green's function exhibits noticeable deviations from the exact benchmark, particularly in resolving low-energy spectral features, despite the ground state energy showing excellent agreement. These findings demonstrate that VQE combined with real-time evolution can effectively extend quantum-classical hybrid DMFT beyond the two-site approximation, particularly for describing insulating phases. While this approach offers a viable pathway for simulating strongly correlated materials on near-term devices, the observation that accurate ground state energy does not guarantee accurate dynamical properties highlights a key challenge for applying such approaches to correlated metals.

Motivation: 为量子霍尔层级构造和任意子超导性建立一个统一的数学框架，该框架需显式包含U(1)电荷守恒并将掺杂过程形式化。

Abstract: We present a unified category-theoretic framework for quantum Hall hierarchy constructions and anyon superconductivity based on modular tensor categories over $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathrm{U}(1))$ and $\mathrm{sRep}(\mathrm{U}(1)^f)$. Our approach explicitly incorporates conserved $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge and formulates doping via a generalized stack-and-condense procedure, in which an auxiliary topological order is stacked onto the parent phase, and the quasiparticles created by doping subsequently condense. Depending on whether this condensation preserves or breaks the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry, the system undergoes a transition to a quantum Hall hierarchy state or to an anyon superconductor. For anyon superconductors, the condensate charge is determined unambiguously by the charged local bosons contained in the condensable algebra. Our framework reproduces all known anyon superconductors obtained from field-theoretic analyses and further predicts novel phases, including a charge-$2e$ anyon superconductor derived from the Laughlin state and charge-$ke$ anyon superconductors arising from bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_k$ Read-Rezayi states. By placing hierarchy transitions and anyon superconductivity within a single mathematical formalism, our work provides a unified understanding of competing and proximate phases near experimentally realizable fractional quantum Hall states.

Abstract: Some recent experiments claim to show that any model in which a quantum state represents mere information about an underlying physical reality of the system must make predictions which contradict those of quantum theory. The present work undertakes to investigate the issue of reality, treading a more fundamental route from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics to the Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics. Motivation for this is a similar approach from the eikonal equation in geometrical optics to the wave equation in electromagnetic theory. We rewrite the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation as a wave equation and seek to generalise de Broglie's wave particle duality by demanding that both particle and light waves have the freedom of being described by any square-integrable function. This generalisation, which allows superposition also for matter wave functions, helps us to obtain the Schrodinger equation, whose solution can be seen to be as much objective as the classical mechanics wave function. Several other equations which one writes in quantum mechanics, including the eigenvalue equations for observables, series expansion of energy states in terms of eigenstates of observables other than energy, etc., can be written in the classical case too. Absence of any collapse of the wave function, entanglement, etc. in the classical realm have their origin in the nonlinearity of the classical wave equation. These considerations indicate that many of the puzzles in quantum mechanics are present also in classical mechanics in a dormant form, which fact shall help to demystify quantum mechanics to a great extent.

Abstract: We investigate the role of quantum monitoring in the dynamical manifestations of Hamiltonian quantum chaos. Specifically, we analyze the generalized spectral form factor, defined as the survival probability of a coherent Gibbs state under continuous energy measurements. We show that quantum monitoring can tailor the signatures of quantum chaos in the dynamics, such as the extension of the ramp in the spectral form factor, by varying the measurement strength and detection efficiency. In particular, a typical quantum trajectory obtained by monitoring with unit efficiency exhibits enhanced quantum chaos relative to the average dynamics and to unitary evolution without measurements.

Conclusion: 揭示了监测量子比特中测量诱导的相变过程，表明相干驱动、测量和退相干的相互作用会产生具有层次结构的动力学相。

Abstract: Quantum jumps, the collapse of a quantum system upon measurement, are among the most striking consequences of observation in quantum mechanics. While recent experiments have revealed the continuous nature of individual jumps, the crossover from coherent dynamics to measurement-dominated behaviour has remained elusive. Here, we tune the measurement strength of a continuously monitored superconducting qubit, and observe that quantum jumps emerge not through a gradual crossover, but via a cascade of three distinct dynamical transitions. The first transition manifests as an exceptional point where coherent oscillations abruptly cease, giving way to jumps towards a stable eigenstate. The second transition marks the onset of dynamical state freezing, where the qubit's dwell time near the eigenstate diverges. A third threshold signals entry into the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger measurement paradoxically suppresses relaxation. Strikingly, we find that decoherence does not blur these transitions but rather fundamentally restructures the dynamical phase diagram, notably inverting their order. These results map measurement-induced transitions in a monitored qubit, revealing that the interplay between coherent driving, measurement, and decoherence gives rise to a hierarchy of distinct dynamical phases.

Abstract: We explore the dynamics of the PXP model when subjected to a periodic drive, and unveil the mechanism through which the interplay between spectral properties and initial states governs the emergence of dynamical revivals and their evolution across the space of driving parameters. For Néel-ordered initial states, revivals follow well-defined trajectories in the parameter space of the driving, primarily determined by a dominant quasi-energy spacing in the Floquet spectrum. Initial states interpolating between Néel and fully polarized configurations exhibit hybrid dynamics, which can be controlled by tuning their overlap with Floquet eigenstates via the driving parameters. This control also allows steering different routes for avoiding Floquet thermalization, showing how both initial state choice and driving protocol shape long-lived dynamics in this driven quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: In this work, we present the integration of Qiskit Nature's quantum chemistry solvers into the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), enabling hybrid quantum-classical workflows for force-driven atomistic simulations. This coupling allows the use of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its adaptive variant (ADAPT-VQE) not only for ground-state energy calculations, but also for geometry optimisation, vibrational frequency analysis, strain evaluation, and molecular dynamics, all managed through ASE's calculator interface. By applying ADAPT-VQE to multi-electron systems such as BeH2, we obtain vibrational and structural properties in close agreement with high-level classical CCSD calculations within the same minimal basis. These results demonstrate that adaptive variational quantum algorithms can deliver stable and chemically meaningful forces within an atomistic modelling workflow, enabling downstream applications such as molecular dynamics and active-learning accelerated simulations.

Abstract: State preparation compilers for quantum computers typically sit at two extremes: general-purpose routines that treat the target as an opaque amplitude vector, and bespoke constructions for a handful of well-known state families. We ask whether a compiler can instead accept simple, structure-aware specifications while providing predictable resource guarantees. We answer this by designing and implementing a quantum state-preparation compiler for regular language states (RLS): uniform superpositions over bitstrings accepted by a regular description, and their complements. Users describe the target state via (i) a finite set of bitstrings, (ii) a regular expression, or (iii) a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), optionally with a complement flag. By translating the input to a DFA, minimizing it, and mapping it to an optimal matrix product state (MPS), the compiler obtains an intermediate representation (IR) that exposes and compresses hidden structure. The efficient DFA representation and minimization offloads expensive linear algebra computation in exchange of simpler automata manipulations. The combination of the regular-language frontend and this IR gives concise specifications not only for RLS but also for their complements that might otherwise require exponentially large state descriptions. This enables state preparation of an RLS or its complement with the same asymptotic resources and compile time. We outline two hardware-aware backends: SeqRLSP, which yields linear-depth, ancilla-free circuits for linear nearest-neighbor architectures via sequential generation, and TreeRLSP, which achieves logarithmic depth on all-to-all connectivity via a tree tensor network. We prove depth and gate-count bounds scaling with the system size and the state's maximal Schmidt rank, and we give explicit compile-time bounds that expose the benefit of our approach. We implement and evaluate the pipeline.

Conclusion: 首次证明连续监测可作为量子混沌的主动调控手段，在特定参数区间能逆转热浴的退相干效应，为实验实现量子信息 scrambling 的精确操控和量子计算性能提升开辟新途径。

Abstract: It is intuitively expected, and supported by earlier studies, that many-body quantum chaos is suppressed, or even destroyed, by dissipative effects induced by continuous monitoring. We show here that this is not always the case. For this purpose, we study the quenched dynamics of a continuously monitored Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, described by the Lindblad formalism, coupled to a thermal environment modeled by another SYK maintained at constant temperature. We find that the combined effect of monitoring and the thermal bath drives the system toward a non-thermal steady state independently of the initial conditions. The corresponding retarded Green's function exhibits two stages of exponential decay, with rates that depend non-monotonously on the thermal bath coupling and the monitoring strength. In the limit of weak coupling, the late time decay of the Green's function, computed analytically, is closely related to that of the thermal bath. Strikingly, we identify a range of parameters in which continuous monitoring, despite being a source of decoherence, induces or enhances quantum chaotic dynamics suppressed by the thermal bath. For instance, in the limit of weak coupling to the thermal bath, the Lyapunov exponent increases sharply when monitoring is turned on. For intermediate values of the thermal bath coupling, the Lyapunov exponent exhibits re-entrant behavior: it vanishes at zero or sufficiently weak monitoring strength, and becomes positive again as the monitoring strength is increased. Our results offer intriguing insights on the mechanisms leading to quantum scrambling which paves the way to its experimental control and consequently to a performance enhancement of quantum information devices.

Conclusion: 建立连接晶体结构、晶格动力学与自旋弛豫的普适实验框架，揭示结构调控SPC的新策略（能量空间重分布），为设计长相干时间分子量子材料提供依据。

Abstract: Electronic spin superposition states enable nanoscale sensing through their sensitivity to the local environment, yet their sensitivity to vibrational motion also limits their coherence times. In molecular spin systems, chemical tunability and atomic-scale resolution are accompanied by a dense, thermally accessible phonon spectrum that introduces efficient spin relaxation pathways. Despite extensive theoretical work, there is little experimental consensus on which vibrational energies dominate spin relaxation or how molecular structure controls spin-phonon coupling (SPC). We present a fully experimental method to quantify SPC coefficients by combining temperature-dependent vibrational spectra from inelastic neutron scattering with spin relaxation rates measured by electron paramagnetic resonance. We apply this framework to two model S = 1/2 systems, copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) and copper(II) octaethylporphyrin (CuOEP). Two distinct relaxation regimes emerge: below 40 K, weakly coupled lattice modes below $50~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ dominate, whereas above 40 K, optical phonons above ~$185~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ become thermally populated and drive relaxation with SPC coefficients nearly three orders of magnitude larger. Structural distortions in CuOEP that break planar symmetry soften the crystal lattice and enhance anharmonic scattering, but also raise the energy of stretching modes at the molecular core where the spins reside. This redistributes vibrational energy toward the molecular periphery and out of plane, ultimately reducing SPC relative to CuPc and enabling room-temperature spin coherence in CuOEP. Although our method does not provide mode-specific SPC coefficients, it quantifies contributions from distinct spectral regions and establishes a broadly applicable, fully experimental link between crystal structure, lattice dynamics, and spin relaxation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum quickest change detection methods assume known post-change states, but real-world scenarios often lack prior knowledge of the altered quantum state, creating a need for universal detection frameworks.

Method: First stage: Uses block POVMs with classical outputs to approximate quantum relative entropy. Second stage: Applies a windowed-CUSUM algorithm (asymptotically optimal in classical settings for unknown distributions) to the classical outputs.

Result: The two-stage approach achieves asymptotic optimality in minimizing the worst-case average detection delay for universal quantum state change detection.

Conclusion: This framework bridges quantum information theory and classical change detection, enabling optimal real-time monitoring of quantum systems with unknown post-change states.

Abstract: This paper investigates the quickest change detection of quantum states in a universal setting: specifically, where the post-change quantum state is not known a priori. We establish the asymptotic optimality of a two-stage approach in terms of worst average delay to detection. The first stage employs block POVMs with classical outputs that preserve quantum relative entropy to arbitrary precision. The second stage leverages a recently proposed windowed-CUSUM algorithm that is known to be asymptotically optimal for quickest change detection with an unknown post-change distribution in the classical setting.

Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for building robust, fault-tolerant quantum computers; however, the decoding process often presents a significant computational bottleneck. Tesseract is a novel Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoder for QEC that employs the A* search algorithm to explore an exponentially large graph of error hypotheses, achieving high decoding speed and accuracy. This paper presents a systematic approach to optimizing the Tesseract decoder through low-level performance enhancements. Based on extensive profiling, we implemented four targeted optimization strategies, including the replacement of inefficient data structures, reorganization of memory layouts to improve cache hit rates, and the use of hardware-accelerated bit-wise operations. We achieved significant decoding speedups across a wide range of code families and configurations, including Color Codes, Bivariate-Bicycle Codes, Surface Codes, and Transversal CNOT Protocols. Our results demonstrate consistent speedups of approximately 2x for most code families, often exceeding 2.5x. Notably, we achieved a peak performance gain of over 5x for the most computationally demanding configurations of Bivariate-Bicycle Codes. These improvements make the Tesseract decoder more efficient and scalable, serving as a practical case study that highlights the importance of high-performance software engineering in QEC and providing a strong foundation for future research.

Conclusion: 建立了界面粗糙度诱导约瑟夫森能量变异的定量直观图景，为约瑟夫森结设计提供直接指导依据

Abstract: As quantum processors scale to large qubit numbers, device-to-device variability emerges as a critical challenge. Superconducting qubits are commonly realized using Al/AlO$_{\text{x}}$/Al Josephson junctions operating in the tunneling regime, where even minor variations in device geometry can lead to substantial performance fluctuations. In this work, we develop a quantitative model for the variability of the Josephson energy $E_{J}$ induced by interface roughness at the Al/AlO$_{\text{x}}$ interfaces. The roughness is modeled as a Gaussian random field characterized by two parameters: the root-mean-square roughness amplitude $σ$ and the transverse correlation length $ξ$. These parameters are extracted from the literature and molecular dynamics simulations. Quantum transport is treated using the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation combined with a local thickness approximation. Numerical simulations over $5,000$ Josephson junctions show that $E_{J}$ follows a log-normal distribution. The mean value of $E_{J}$ increases with $σ$ and decreases slightly with $ξ$, while the variance of $E_{J}$ increases with both $σ$ and $ξ$. These results paint a quantitative and intuitive picture of Josephson energy variability induced by surface roughness, with direct relevance for junction design.

Conclusion: 姆潘巴类加速弛豫可作为实用工具用于快速准确的量子比特初始化，克服了量子信息处理中的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Passive qubit reset is a key primitive for quantum information processing, whereby qubits are initialized by allowing them to relax to their ground state through natural dissipation, without the need for active control or feedback. However, passive reset occurs on timescales that are much longer than those of gate operations and measurements, making it a significant bottleneck for algorithmic execution. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by exploiting the Mpemba effect, originally indicating the faster cooling of hot systems compared to cooler ones. Focusing on the regime where coherence times exceed energy relaxation times ($T_2 > T_1$), we propose a simple protocol based on a single entangling two-qubit gate that converts local single-qubit coherences into fast-decaying global two-qubit coherences. This removes their overlap with the slowest decaying Liouvillian mode and enables a substantially faster relaxation to the ground state. For realistic parameters, we find that our protocol can reduce reset times by up to $50\%$ compared to standard passive reset. We analyze the robustness of the protocol under non-Markovian noise, imperfect coherent control and finite temperature, finding that the accelerated reset persists across a broad range of realistic error sources. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of our protocol on an IQM superconducting quantum processor. Our results demonstrate how Mpemba-like accelerated relaxation can be harnessed as a practical tool for fast and accurate qubit initialization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond conventional heat engines that require two energy reservoirs and enable engines that harness quantum coherence in conserved quantities like spin angular momentum.

Method: Ion-trap implementation using a two-photon Raman transition to convert heat from a thermal energy reservoir into optical work, followed by non-energetic information erasure via a spin reservoir to reset spin states.

Result: A spin-heat engine operating between energy and spin thermal reservoirs rather than two energy reservoirs, with work extraction and angular momentum-costing reset demonstrated in principle.

Conclusion: This represents an important first step toward heat engines beyond the conventional paradigm, paving the way to harness quantum coherence in arbitrary conserved quantities via similar machines.

Abstract: We propose an ion-trap implementation of the Vaccaro, Barnett and Wright et al. spin-heat engine (SHE); a hypothetical engine that operates between energy and spin thermal reservoirs rather than two energy reservoirs. The SHE operates in two steps: first, in the work extraction stage, heat from a thermal energy reservoir is converted into optical work via a two photon Raman transition resonant with close-to energy degenerate spin states; second, the internal spin states are brought back to their initial state via non-energetic information erasure using a spin reservoir. The latter incurs no energy cost, but rather the reset occurs at the cost of angular momentum from a spin bath that acts as the thermal spin reservoir. The SHE represents an important first step toward demonstrating heat engines that operate beyond the conventional paradigm of requiring two thermal reservoirs, paving the way to harness quantum coherence in arbitrary conserved quantities via similar machines.

Abstract: Transport phenomena play a key role in a variety of application domains, and efficient simulation of these dynamics remains an outstanding challenge. While quantum computers offer potential for significant speedups, existing algorithms either lack rigorous theoretical guarantees or demand substantial quantum resources, preventing scalable and efficient validation on realistic quantum hardware. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive framework for simulating classes of transport equations, offering both rigorous theoretical guarantees -- including exponential speedups in specific cases -- and a systematic, hardware-efficient implementation. Central to our approach is the Hamiltonian embedding technique, a white-box approach for end-to-end simulation of sparse Hamiltonians that avoids abstract query models and retains near-optimal asymptotic complexity. Empirical resource estimates indicate that our approach can yield an order-of-magnitude (e.g., $42\times$) reduction in circuit depth given favorable problem structures. We then apply our framework to solve linear and nonlinear transport PDEs, including the first experimental demonstration of a 2D advection equation on a trapped-ion quantum computer.

Abstract: Critical decision-making issues in science, engineering, and industry are based on combinatorial optimization; however, its application is inherently limited by the NP-hard nature of the problem. A specialized paradigm of analogue quantum computing, quantum annealing (QA), has been proposed to solve these problems by encoding optimization problems into physical energy landscapes and solving them by quantum tunnelling systematically through exploration of solution space. This is a critical review that summarizes the current applications of quantum annealing to combinatorial optimization and includes a theoretical background, hardware designs, algorithm implementation strategies, encoding and embedding schemes, protocols to benchmark quantum annealing, areas of implementation, and links with the quantum algorithms implementation with gate-based hardware and classical solvers. We develop a unified framework, relating adiabatic quantum dynamics, Ising and QUBO models, stoquastic and non-stoquastic Hamiltonians, and diabatic transitions to modern flux-qubit annealers (Chimera, Pegasus, Zephyr topologies), and emergent architectures (Lechner-Hauke-Zoller systems, Rydberg atom platforms), and hybrids of quantum and classical computation. Through our analysis, we find that overhead in embedding and encoding is the largest determinant of the scalability and performance (this is not just the number of qubits). Minor embeddings also usually have a physical qubit count per logical variable of between 5 and 12 qubits, which limits effective problem capacity by 80-92% and, due to chain-breaking errors, compromises the quality of solutions.

Abstract: The variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with a parametrized quantum circuit is widely applicable to near-term quantum computing, but its fundamental issues that limit optimization performance have been reported in the literature. For example, VQA optimization often suffers from vanishing gradients called barren plateau (BP) and the presence of local minima in the landscape of the cost function. Numerical studies have shown that the trap in local minima is significantly reduced when the circuit is overparametrized (OP), where the number of parameters exceeds a certain threshold. Theoretical understanding of the BP and OP phenomena has advanced over the past years, however, comprehensive studies of both effects in the same setting are not fully covered in the literature. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive numerical study in VQA, quantitatively evaluating the impacts of BP and OP and their interplay on the optimization of a variational quantum circuit, using concrete implementations of one-dimensional transverse and longitudinal field quantum Ising model. The numerical results are compared with the theoretical diagnostics of BP and OP phenomena. The framework presented in this paper will provide a guiding principle for designing VQA algorithms and ansatzes with theoretical support for behaviors of parameter optimization in practical settings.

Result: On 4,763 labeled channel sequences from 433 tokamak discharges, the model achieved 97.0% accuracy in screening corrupted diagnostic data, matching state-of-the-art deep classical CNNs while using orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: This establishes a practical, physics-grounded paradigm for leveraging quantum processing in constrained environments, offering a scalable path for quantum-enhanced edge computing.

Abstract: The potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in data-intensive science is strictly bottlenecked the difficulty of interfacing high-dimensional, chaotic classical data into resource-limited, noisy quantum processors. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physics-informed Koopman-Quantum hybrid framework, theoretically grounded in a representation-level structural isomorphism we establish between the Koopman operator, which linearizes nonlinear dynamics, and quantum evolution. Based on this theoretical foundation, we design a realizable NISQ-friendly pipeline: the Koopman operator functions as a physics-aware "data distiller," compressing waveforms into compact, "quantum-ready" features, which are subsequently processed by a modular, parallel quantum neural network. We validated this framework on 4,763 labeled channel sequences from 433 discharges of the tokamak system. The results demonstrate that our model achieves 97.0\% accuracy in screening corrupted diagnostic data, matching the performance of state-of-the-art deep classical CNNs while using orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters. This work establishes a practical, physics-grounded paradigm for leveraging quantum processing in constrained environments, offering a scalable path for quantum-enhanced edge computing.

Abstract: Protocols based on the sending-or-not-sending (SNS) principle have been intensively studied in recent years and have been shown to enable the longest transmission distances in quantum key distribution (QKD). In this work, we propose a sending-or-not-sending phase-matching QKD protocol (SNS-PM-QKD) that improves tolerance to phase mismatch, thereby extending the achievable transmission distance. We present a security analysis of SNS-PM-QKD in the asymptotic (infinite-key) regime under collective attacks. The performance of the proposed protocol is compared with that of standard phase-matching QKD, theoretical SNS-type twin-field QKD protocols (SNS-TF-QKD), and an experimental SNS-TF-QKD operated over transmission distances of up to 1002km. Our results show that SNS-PM-QKD achieves greater transmission distances than these existing protocols, highlighting its potential for long-distance quantum communication.

### [95] [A Tunable, Modeless, and Hybridization-free Cross-Kerr Coupler for Miniaturized Superconducting Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03186)
*Gihwan Kim,Andreas Butler,Oskar Painter*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A novel SQUID-based coupling architecture for superconducting quantum circuits replaces traditional capacitive coupling to address design conflicts and error limitations, enabling fast, high-fidelity gates and scalable quantum processor designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capacitive charge-based linear coupling schemes struggle to simultaneously maintain large qubit anharmonicity/coherence while achieving high connectivity and packing density. Additionally, tunable interactions cause dynamical mode hybridization variations that induce non-adiabatic transitions, leakage errors, and gate speed limitations.

Method: Proposes a junction-based coupling architecture using SQUID couplers with small Josephson energies. These couplers provide intrinsic cross-Kerr interactions controlled by external fluxes without relying on mode hybridization. The small Josephson energies maintain interactions at a perturbative scale, limiting undesired higher-order mixing while achieving sufficient cross-Kerr strength from diagonal coupling elements.

Result: Demonstrates that SQUID couplers can implement fast, adiabatic, and high-fidelity controlled-Z gates without extra modes. The operation is robust against junction asymmetry for high-frequency qubits. Unconventional crosstalk from asymmetries and parasitic hybridization is sufficiently small for realistic circuit parameters.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable tiling strategy for a miniaturized superconducting quantum processor based on merged-element transmon qubits, demonstrating the practical utility of junction-based coupling schemes for building large-scale quantum computers.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits typically use capacitive charge-based linear coupling schemes to control interactions between elements such as qubits. While simple and effective, this coupling scheme makes it difficult to satisfy competing circuit design requirements such as maintaining large qubit anharmonicity and coherence along with a high degree of qubit connectivity and packing density. Moreover, tunable interactions using linear coupling elements produce dynamical variations in mode hybridization, which can induce non-adiabatic transitions, resulting in leakage errors and limiting gate speeds. In this work we attempt to address these challenges by proposing a junction-based coupling architecture based on SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) couplers with relatively small Josephson energies. SQUID couplers provide intrinsic cross-Kerr interactions that can be controlled by external fluxes and that do not rely on mode hybridization. The small Josephson energies of the coupler maintain the interaction at a perturbative scale, which limits undesired higher-order mixing between coupled elements while achieving a sufficiently strong cross-Kerr interaction originating from diagonal coupling elements. Based on these properties, we show that a SQUID coupler can be used to implement a fast, adiabatic, and high-fidelity controlled-Z gate without introducing extra modes, and the operation is robust against junction asymmetry for high-frequency qubits. Although unconventional crosstalk may arise due to junction asymmetries and parasitic hybridization with spectator qubits, we show that these effects are sufficiently small for realistic circuit parameters. As an example of the utility of such junction-based coupling schemes, we present a scalable tiling strategy for a miniaturized superconducting quantum processor based on merged-element transmon qubits.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该研究通过向Floquet Clifford电路中引入随机单比特门（"掺杂"）和耗散通道，发现系统的Liouvillian间隙在热力学极限下存在两种截然不同的标度行为：未掺杂时Δ∼γN（随系统尺寸线性增长），完全掺杂时Δ保持有限值。掺杂密度p_h控制两种混沌耗散 regime的 crossover，且空间掺杂结构决定间隙标度，即使每周期重采样Haar旋转仍成立。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究超出Clifford动力学的最小偏离如何引发本征弛豫行为，解决耗散混沌诊断中Liouvillian间隙的起源问题，并揭示空间结构对量子混沌耗散特征的影响。

Method: 构建Floquet两比特Clifford电路（基于iSWAP类门）与有限密度p_h的Haar随机单比特门交替作用，后接去极化通道（强度γ）；通过解析推导强耗散 regime（γ≫1）的间隙下界及有限间隙构造，结合数值计算研究γ→0的扩展行为。

Result: 1. 识别两种Liouvillian间隙标度 regime：未掺杂电路Δ∼γN（尺寸依赖），完全掺杂电路Δ在N→∞时保持有限；2. 掺杂密度p_h主导crossover：p_h→0时保持未掺杂特性，有限p_h下特定结构可进入有限间隙 regime；3. 间隙标度仅取决于空间掺杂结构，与Haar旋转是否每周期重采样无关。

Conclusion: 空间掺杂结构是决定耗散量子混沌中Liouvillian间隙标度的关键因素，揭示了非Clifford成分密度与系统尺寸如何共同调控本征弛豫行为，为最小混沌单元的设计提供理论依据。

Abstract: Quantum chaos is commonly assessed through probe-dependent signatures such as spectral statistics, OTOCs, and entanglement growth, which need not coincide. Recently, a dissipative diagnostic of chaos has been proposed, in which an infinitesimal coupling to a bath yields a finite Liouvillian gap in chaotic systems, marking the onset of intrinsic relaxation. This raises a conceptual question: what is the minimal departure from Clifford dynamics needed for this intrinsically relaxing behavior to emerge? In this work, we investigate the dynamics under the Floquet two-qubit Clifford circuit interleaved with a finite density of Haar-random single-site gates, followed by a depolarizing channel with strength $γ$. For Floquet Clifford circuits built from an \textit{i}SWAP-class two-qubit gate, our analysis identifies two distinct regimes for the Liouvillian gap in the thermodynamic limit, exemplified by the undoped and fully doped extreme cases. In both regimes, the dissipative diagnostic signals chaotic behavior, differing only in how the gap scales with system size. In the undoped circuit, the gap scales as $Δ\sim γN$, whereas in the fully doped circuit it remains finite as $N\to\infty$. We find that the doping density $p_h$ governs the crossover: as $p_h\to 0$, any spatial structure remains undoped-like, whereas for finite $p_h$ certain structures can enter a finite-gap regime. These results are analytically established in the strongly dissipative regime $γ\gg 1$ by deriving lower bounds on the gap as a function of $p_h$ and explicit finite-gap constructions, and their extension toward $γ\to 0$ is supported by numerics. Importantly, our analytic treatment depends only on the spatial doping structure, so the same gap scaling persists even when the Haar rotations are independently resampled each Floquet period.

TL;DR: 针对量子容错计算中软输出评估方法计算开销大、硬件兼容性差的问题，本文提出两种基于早停技术的软输出计算方法：有界簇间隙和簇外间隙，显著降低了计算复杂度并提升了FPGA硬件兼容性。


<details>

Motivation: Meister等人提出的基于聚类的软输出评估方法在并行计算环境中计算复杂度与UF解码器相当甚至更高，且需要全局解码图信息，不适合现有FPGA硬件实现，导致巨大开销。

Method: 引入早停技术，提出两种新型软输出：1)有界簇间隙，通过提前终止计算降低复杂度；2)簇外间隙，通过在已解码簇上进行微小额外生长来量化解码器可靠性，无需修改现有FPGA架构。

Conclusion: 这两种技术提供了更低计算复杂度和更高硬件兼容性，为未来带软输出的实时解码器奠定了关键基础。

Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing, soft outputs from real-time decoders play a crucial role in improving decoding accuracy, post-selecting magic states, and accelerating lattice surgery. A recent paper by Meister et al. [arXiv:2405.07433 (2024)] proposed an efficient method to evaluate soft outputs for cluster-based decoders, including the Union-Find (UF) decoder. However, in parallel computing environments, its computational complexity is comparable to or even surpasses that of the UF decoder itself, resulting in a substantial overhead. Furthermore, this method requires global information about the decoding graph, making it poorly suited for existing hardware implementations of the UF decoder on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). In this paper, to alleviate these issues, we develop more efficient methods for evaluating high-quality soft outputs in cluster-based decoders by introducing several early-stopping techniques. Our central idea is that the precise value of a large soft output is often unnecessary in practice. Based on this insight, we introduce two types of novel soft-outputs: the bounded cluster gap and the extra-cluster gap. The former reduces the computational complexity of Meister's method by terminating the calculation at an early stage. Our numerical simulations show that this method achieves improved scaling with code distance $d$ compared to the original proposal. The latter, the extra-cluster gap, quantifies decoder reliability by performing a small, additional growth of the clusters obtained by the decoder. This approach offers the significant advantage of enabling soft-output computation without modifying the existing architecture of FPGA-implemented UF decoders. These techniques offer lower computational complexity and higher hardware compatibility, laying a crucial foundation for future real-time decoders with soft outputs.

Conclusion: Zak相位在连续体系中不能 universally 作为拓扑标记，D类的非量子化行为揭示了传统拓扑分类在连续模型中的局限性，体边对应需考虑边界细节

Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of a generalized Dirac--Kronig--Penney model, a continuum one-dimensional model for a relativistic quantum chain. By tuning the coupling parameters this model can accommodate five Altland--Zirnbauer--Cartan symmetry classes, three of which (AIII, BDI and D) support non-trivial topological phases in dimension one. We characterize analytically the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian in terms of a spectral function, and numerically compute the Zak phase to probe the bulk topological content of the insulating phases. Our findings reveal that, while the Zak phase is quantized in classes AIII and BDI, it exhibits non-quantized values in class D, challenging its traditional role as a topological marker in continuum settings. We also discuss the bulk-boundary correspondence for a truncated version of the chain, analyzing how the emergence of edge states depends on both the truncation position and the boundary conditions. In classes AIII and BDI, we find that the Zak phase effectively detects edge states as a relative boundary topological index, although the correspondence is highly sensitive to the parameters characterizing the truncation.

Abstract: Quantum generative models offer a novel approach to exploring high-dimensional Hilbert spaces but face significant challenges in scalability and expressibility when applied to multi-modal distributions. In this study, we explore a Hybrid Quantum-Classical U-Net architecture integrated with Adaptive Non-Local Observables (ANO) as a potential solution to these hurdles. By compressing classical data into a dense quantum latent space and utilizing trainable observables, our model aims to extract non-local features that complement classical processing. We also investigate the role of Skip Connections in preserving semantic information during the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results on the full MNIST dataset (digits 0-9) demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating structurally coherent and recognizable images for all digit classes. While hardware constraints still impose limitations on resolution, our findings suggest that hybrid architectures with adaptive measurements provide a feasible pathway for mitigating mode collapse and enhancing generative capabilities in the NISQ era.

Abstract: We report the generation of quantum entanglement between the center-of-mass motion of a levitated nanosphere, coupled by coherent scattering to an optical cavity mode, and the electromagnetic field. Using heterodyne detection, we reconstruct the full set of optical-mechanical correlations and observe a violation of separability bounds between the mechanical degrees of freedom and the propagating optical mode. Thus, we demonstrate the ability to distribute nonclassical correlations beyond the interaction region. Our results are obtained at room temperature and are robust over a broad range of detunings set by the cavity linewidth. These findings establish levitated optomechanical systems as a promising platform for macroscopic quantum optics and for future tests of fundamental physics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate structured artifacts, but using them as dependable optimizers for scientific design requires a mechanism for iterative improvement under black-box evaluation. Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design. These results illustrate both the promise and the pitfalls of memory evaluator-guided LLM optimization for circuit synthesis, highlighting the critical role of prior human-made theoretical theorem to optimally design a custom tool in support of research.

Motivation: Current quantum computers are limited by insufficient qubits and high error rates, preventing practical execution of larger quantum algorithms. Quantum circuit cutting offers a potential solution by enabling large circuits to run on smaller hardware.

Method: The researchers compared different cutting strategies (Pauli measurements, random unitary measurements, and Randomized Clifford measurements) for quantum circuit cutting. They applied this technique to a QAOA algorithm and evaluated performance through simulations.

Result: First, Randomized Clifford measurements demonstrated superior performance compared to both Pauli and random unitary measurements. Second, circuit cutting faced significant challenges in noisy environments, with accuracy deteriorating as the number of sub-circuits increased.

Conclusion: While quantum circuit cutting is a promising approach with optimal measurement strategies like Randomized Clifford, its practical application is currently limited by noise sensitivity that worsens with circuit complexity, highlighting the need for improved error mitigation techniques.

Abstract: Current quantum computers suffer from a limited number of qubits and high error rates, limiting practical applicability. Different techniques exist to mitigate these effects and run larger algorithms. In this work, we analyze one of these techniques called quantum circuit cutting. With circuit cutting, a quantum circuit is decomposed into smaller sub-circuits, each of which can be run on smaller quantum hardware. We compare the performance of quantum circuit cutting with different cutting strategies, and then apply circuit cutting to a QAOA algorithm. Using simulations, we first show that Randomized Clifford measurements outperform both Pauli and random unitary measurements. Second, we show that circuit cutting has trouble providing correct answers in noisy settings, especially as the number of circuits increases.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Open Quantum Brownian Motion (OQBM) as a scaling limit of open quantum walks, deriving a hybrid quantum-classical master equation that reveals non-Gaussian dynamics despite Gaussian limiting distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish Open Quantum Brownian Motion (OQBM) as a rigorous scaling limit of discrete open quantum walks, incorporating both external (position) and internal degrees of freedom of a Brownian particle in a thermal bath, which standard quantum Brownian motion models may not fully capture.

Method: 1. Apply rotating wave approximation (RWA) to the system-bath Hamiltonian for a weakly driven Brownian particle in a harmonic potential. 2. Derive a completely positive Born-Markov master equation for reduced dynamics. 3. Transform to coordinate representation and perform adiabatic elimination of fast variables to obtain a hybrid quantum-classical master equation defining OQBM. 4. Analyze dynamics via initial Gaussian/non-Gaussian distributions and compute moments/cumulants numerically.

Result: 1. OQBM dynamics converge to Gaussian distributions regardless of initial state (Gaussian or non-Gaussian), matching standard OQBM behavior. 2. The third-order cumulant is nonzero, proving the dynamics' intrinsic generator is non-Gaussian. 3. Numerical solutions for Gaussian initial distributions confirm robust behavior across parameter regimes.

Conclusion: OQBM provides a novel framework bridging discrete open quantum walks and continuous quantum Brownian motion, demonstrating that while position distributions become Gaussian in the limit, the underlying dynamics remain fundamentally non-Gaussian due to environmental interactions—a critical insight for quantum thermodynamics and decoherence studies.

Abstract: Open Quantum Brownian Motion (OQBM) was introduced as a scaling limit of discrete-time open quantum walks. This limit defines a new class of quantum Brownian motion, which incorporates both the external and internal degrees of freedom of the Brownian particle. We consider a weakly driven Brownian particle confined in a harmonic potential and dissipatively coupled to a thermal bath. Applying the rotating wave approximation (RWA) to the system-bath interaction Hamiltonian, we derive a completely positive Born-Markov master equation for the reduced dynamics. We express the resulting master equation in the coordinate representation and, utilizing the adiabatic elimination of fast variables, derive a completely positive hybrid quantum-classical master equation that defines OQBM. We illustrate the resulting dynamics using examples of initial Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions of the OQBM walker. Both examples reveal the emergence of Gaussian distributions in the limiting behavior of the OQBM dynamics, which closely matches that of the standard OQBM. With the help of the obtained OQBM master equation, we derive the equations for the $n$-th moments and the cumulants of the position distribution of the open Brownian walker. We subsequently solve these equations numerically for Gaussian initial distributions across various parameter regimes. Notably, we find that the third-order cumulant is nonzero, indicating that the dynamics' intrinsic generator is non-Gaussian.

Abstract: A complex tensor with $n$ binary indices can be identified with a multilinear polynomial in $n$ complex variables. We say it is a Lee-Yang tensor with radius $r$ if the polynomial is nonzero whenever all variables lie in the open disk of radius $r$. In this work we study quantum states and observables which are Lee-Yang tensors when expressed in the computational basis. We first review their basic properties, including closure under tensor contraction and certain quantum operations. We show that quantum states with Lee-Yang radius $r > 1$ can be prepared by quasipolynomial-sized circuits. We also show that every Hermitian operator with Lee-Yang radius $r > 1$ has a unique principal eigenvector. These results suggest that $r = 1$ is a key threshold for quantum states and observables. Finally, we consider a family of two-local Hamiltonians where every interaction term energetically favors a deformed EPR state $|00\rangle + s|11\rangle$ for some $0 \leq s \leq 1$. We numerically investigate this model and find that on all graphs considered the Lee-Yang radius of the ground state is at least $r = 1/\sqrt{s}$ while the spectral gap between the two smallest eigenvalues is at least $1-s^2$. We conjecture that these lower bounds hold more generally; in particular, this would provide an efficient quantum adiabatic algorithm for the quantum Max-Cut problem on uniformly weighted bipartite graphs.

Conclusion: 该工作通过结合变分最优性与解析可处理性，为高精度系统学习和哈密顿量工程提供了系统化、实验验证的解决方案。

Abstract: The effective Hamiltonian serves as the conceptual pivot of quantum engineering, transforming physical complexity into programmable logic; yet, its construction remains compromised by the mathematical non-uniqueness of block diagonalization, which introduces an intrinsic "gauge freedom" that standard methods fail to resolve. We address this by establishing the Least Action Unitary Transformation (LAUT) as the fundamental principle for effective models. By minimizing geometric action, LAUT guarantees dynamical fidelity and inherently enforces the preservation of symmetries--properties frequently violated by conventional Schrieffer-Wolff and Givens rotation techniques. We identify the Bloch-Brandow formalism as the natural perturbative counterpart to this principle, yielding analytic expansions that preserve symmetries to high order. We validate this framework against experimental data from superconducting quantum processors, demonstrating that LAUT quantitatively reproduces interaction rates in driven entangling gates where standard approximations diverge. Furthermore, in tunable coupler architectures, we demonstrate that the LAUT approach captures essential non-rotating-wave contributions that standard models neglect; this inclusion is critical for quantitatively reproducing interaction rates and revealing physical multi-body interactions such as $XZX+YZY$, which are verified to be physical rather than gauge artifacts. By reconciling variational optimality with analytical tractability, this work provides a systematic, experimentally validated route for high-precision system learning and Hamiltonian engineering.

Conclusion: 建立了超越传统临界性的量子计量新范式，为实用化量子精密测量提供了避免临界减速效应的新途径。

Abstract: Critical quantum metrology exploits the dramatic growth of the quantum Fisher information near quantum phase transitions to enhance the precision of parameter estimation. Traditionally, this enhancement is associated with a closing energy gap, which causes the characteristic timescales for adiabatic preparation or relaxation to diverge with increasing system size. Consequently, the apparent growth of the quantum Fisher information largely reflects the increasing evolution time induced by critical slowing down, rather than a genuine gain in metrological performance, thereby severely limiting the practical usefulness of such protocols. Here we show that the relationship between energy-gap variations, quantum Fisher information, and achievable precision is far more subtle in interacting quantum systems: enhanced sensitivity does not require a vanishing gap, and, perhaps more surprisingly, a decreasing quantum Fisher information does not necessarily imply reduced precision once the time is properly taken into account. Building on this insight, we introduce an anti-critical metrology scheme that achieves enhanced precision while the energy gap increases. We illustrate this mechanism using the quantum Rabi model, thereby identifying a route to metrological advantage that avoids the critical slowing down associated with conventional criticality.

Conclusion: QVBF完全表征量子真空测量引擎性能，为设计高效量子引擎提供普适性原理，突破传统热力学对微观机制的依赖

Abstract: Quantum measurements can inject energy into quantum systems, enabling engines whose operation is powered entirely by measurements. We develop a general theory of quantum vacuum measurement engines by introducing the quantum vacuum bending function (QVBF), a quantity that characterizes the lowering of the ground-state energy due to interactions. We show that all thermodynamic observables, including work and efficiency, are governed solely by the shape of the ground-state energy landscape encoded in the QVBF, regardless of microscopic details. We further demonstrate that work fluctuations are defined by the curvature of QVBF modulated by a model-dependent quantity, and are constrained by a generalized quantum fluctuation relation that involves the interplay between quantum Fisher information and the ground-state energy landscape. Exactly solvable models and numerical simulations of single and many-body systems confirm the theory and illustrate how the QVBF alone determines the performance of quantum vacuum measurement engines.

Abstract: Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy captures the chiroptical response of molecules, enabling absolute configuration assignment that is vital for enantioselective synthesis and drug design. The practical use of ECD spectra in predictive modeling remains restricted, as existing approaches offer limited confidence for chiral discrimination. By contrast, theoretical ECD calculations demand substantial computational effort rooted in electronic structure theory, which constrains their scalability to larger chemically diverse molecules. These limitations underscore the need for computational approaches that retain first principles physical rigor while enabling efficient and scalable prediction. Motivated by recent advances in quantum algorithms for chemistry, we introduce a variational quantum framework combined with the quantum equation of motion formalism to compute molecular properties and predict ECD spectra, implemented within a multi GPU or QPU accelerated hybrid quantum/classical workflow. We demonstrate its efficient applicability on 12 clinically relevant chiral drug molecules accessing expanded active spaces. The proposed framework is assessed by comparison with established classical wavefunction based methods, employing Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) for ground-state energy benchmarks and Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CASCI) as the reference method for excited state energies and chiroptical properties within the same active orbital space. Notably, the quantum computed ECD spectra, obtained from chemically relevant active spaces mapped onto quantum circuits of approximately 20 to 24 qubits, exhibit near quantitative agreement with classical reference calculations, accurately reproducing spectral line shapes, Cotton effect signs, and relative peak intensities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend quantum algorithmic speedups for derivative pricing from simplified Black-Scholes models to more practical financial models like CIR and Heston stochastic volatility, addressing a key gap between theoretical quantum advantage and real-world quantitative finance applications.

Method: Leverages the "fast-forwardability" property of underlying SDEs for CIR and Heston models; introduces a quantum Milstein sampler based on a novel quantum algorithm for sampling Lévy areas to enable quantum multi-level Monte Carlo for correlated multi-dimensional processes; performs improved numerical integration analysis and investigates arithmetic-free quantum procedures; critiques quantum PDE solvers with amplitude estimation.

Result: Demonstrates novel quadratic speedups for CIR and Heston models; enables quantum speedups for general multi-dimensional stochastic processes with certain correlations; achieves substantial resource reductions for GBM and CIR pricing; identifies theoretical barriers preventing quantum speedup via PDE solvers for derivative pricing.

Conclusion: The research significantly advances quantum algorithms in quantitative finance by extending speedups to practical models, introducing new sampling techniques, and clarifying limitations of alternative approaches, thereby addressing key challenges and open questions in quantum derivative pricing.

Abstract: This paper explores advancements in quantum algorithms for derivative pricing of exotics, a computational pipeline of fundamental importance in quantitative finance. For such cases, the classical Monte Carlo integration procedure provides the state-of-the-art provable, asymptotic performance: polynomial in problem dimension and quadratic in inverse-precision. While quantum algorithms are known to offer quadratic speedups over classical Monte Carlo methods, end-to-end speedups have been proven only in the simplified setting over the Black-Scholes geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model. This paper extends existing frameworks to demonstrate novel quadratic speedups for more practical models, such as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and a variant of Heston's stochastic volatility model, utilizing a characteristic of the underlying SDEs which we term fast-forwardability. Additionally, for general models that do not possess the fast-forwardable property, we introduce a quantum Milstein sampler, based on a novel quantum algorithm for sampling Lévy areas, which enables quantum multi-level Monte Carlo to achieve quadratic speedups for multi-dimensional stochastic processes exhibiting certain correlation types.
  We also present an improved analysis of numerical integration for derivative pricing, leading to substantial reductions in the resource requirements for pricing GBM and CIR models. Furthermore, we investigate the potential for additional reductions using arithmetic-free quantum procedures. Finally, we critique quantum partial differential equation (PDE) solvers as a method for derivative pricing based on amplitude estimation, identifying theoretical barriers that obstruct achieving a quantum speedup through this approach. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of quantum algorithms in derivative pricing, addressing key challenges and open questions in the field.

Abstract: Distributed quantum sensing leverages quantum correlations among multiple sensors to enhance the precision of parameter estimation beyond classical limits. Most existing approaches target phase estimation and rely on a shared phase reference between the signal and the probe, yet many relevant scenarios deal with regimes where such a reference is absent, making the estimation of force or field amplitudes the main task. We study this phase-insensitive regime for bosonic sensors that undergo identical displacements with common phases randomly varying between experimental runs. We derive analytical bounds on the achievable precision and show that it is determined by first-order normal correlations between modes in the probe state, constrained by their average excitations. These correlations yield a collective sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum limit, with a gain that grows linearly in the total excitation number, revealing a distributed quantum advantage even without a global phase reference. We identify families of multimode states with definite joint parity that saturate this limit and can be probed efficiently via local parity measurements already demonstrated or emerging in several quantum platforms. We further demonstrate that experimentally relevant decoherence channels favor two distinct sensing strategies: splitting of a single-mode nonclassical state among the modes, which is robust to loss and heating, and separable probes, which are instead resilient to dephasing and phase jitter. Our results are relevant to multimode continuous platforms, including trapped-ion, solid-state mechanical, optomechanical, superconducting, and photonic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard optical fluorescence methods for measuring spin ensembles have poor readout fidelity. Microwave resonator-mediated measurements offer an alternative, but a complete analysis of noise sources is missing. The motivation is to develop precise measurement protocols that can reach or surpass the standard quantum limit.

Method: The authors studied dispersive readout of an inhomogeneously broadened spin ensemble coupled to a driven resonator, measured via homodyne detection. They derived analytical conditions to identify when measurement is limited by fundamental spin-projection noise versus technical noise sources.

Result: They found generic analytic conditions determining when homodyne measurement is limited by spin-projection noise. They also proposed a protocol for directly detecting spin squeezing (reduction of intrinsic projection noise due to entanglement).

Conclusion: The proposed protocol provides a method to benchmark entangled states for quantum-enhanced metrology, enabling precise spin polarization measurements in solid-state systems beyond standard quantum limits.

Abstract: We theoretically explore protocols for measuring the spin polarization of an ensemble of solid-state spins, with precision at or below the standard quantum limit. Such measurements in the solid-state are challenging, as standard approaches based on optical fluorescence are often limited by poor readout fidelity. Indirect microwave resonator-mediated measurements provide an attractive alternative, though a full analysis of relevant sources of measurement noise is lacking. In this work we study dispersive readout of an inhomogeneously broadened spin ensemble via coupling to a driven resonator measured via homodyne detection. We derive generic analytic conditions for when the homodyne measurement can be limited by the fundamental spin-projection noise, as opposed to microwave-drive shot noise or resonator phase noise. By studying fluctuations of the measurement record in detail, we also propose an experimental protocol for directly detecting spin squeezing, i.e. a reduction of the spin ensemble's intrinsic projection noise from entanglement. Our protocol provides a method for benchmarking entangled states for quantum-enhanced metrology.

Abstract: Quantum criticality in the presence of strong quenched randomness remains a challenging topic in modern condensed matter theory. We show that the topology and anomaly associated with average symmetry can be used to predict certain nontrivial universal properties. Our focus is on systems subject to average Lieb--Schultz--Mattis constraints, where lattice translation symmetry is preserved only on average, while on-site symmetries remain exact. We argue that in the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the system must exhibit critical correlations of local operators in two distinct ways: (i) for some operator $O_e$ charged under exact symmetries, the first absolute moment correlation $\overline{|\langle O_e(x)O^{\dagger}_e(y)\rangle|}$ decays slowly; and (ii) for some operator $O_a$ charged under average symmetries, the first-moment correlation $\overline{\langle O_a(x)O^{\dagger}_a(y)\rangle}$ decays slowly. We verify these predictions in a few examples: the random-singlet Heisenberg spin chain in one dimension, and the disordered free-fermion critical states in symmetry class BDI in one and two dimensions. Surprisingly, even for these well-studied systems, our anomaly-based argument reveals critical correlations overlooked in previous literature. We also discuss the experimental feasibility of measuring these critical correlations.

Conclusion: UNSO框架成功突破了传统NS迭代的局限性，通过结构简化和系数学习，为矩阵正交化提供了更高效、稳定的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Newton-Schulz (NS) iteration has gained increasing interest for its role in the Muon optimizer and the Stiefel manifold. However, the conventional NS iteration suffers from inefficiency and instability. Although various improvements have been introduced to NS iteration, they fail to deviate from the conventional iterative paradigm, which could increase computation burden largely due to the matrix products along the long dimension repeatedly. To address this, we consolidate the iterative structure into a unified framework, named Unified Newton-Schulz Orthogonalization (UNSO). To do so, we could avoid a polynomial expansion. Instead, we evaluate the role of each matrix power, remove the insignificant terms, and provide a recommended polynomial with learnable coefficients. These learnable coefficients are then optimized, and achieve an outstanding performance with stable convergence. The code of our method is available: https://github.com/greekinRoma/Unified_Newton_Schulz_Orthogonalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning methods in NLP suffer from inefficient parameter reuse across tasks, risk catastrophic forgetting when tasks are dissimilar, and introduce unnecessary new parameters that hinder knowledge sharing among similar tasks.

Method: Sparse Adapter Fusion Method (SAFM) that dynamically fuses old and new adapters through two stages: (1) Decision stage determines whether to incorporate new, reuse existing, or add empty adapters via architecture search prioritizing parameter efficiency; (2) Tuning stage uses layer-wise loss to encourage adapter differentiation and capture task-specific knowledge.

Result: SAFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while utilizing less than 60% of the parameters, demonstrating superior parameter efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: SAFM effectively addresses key challenges in continual learning by enabling dynamic adapter fusion, minimizing parameter consumption, maximizing reuse, and preventing catastrophic forgetting, offering a more efficient solution for NLP applications.

Abstract: Continual learning in natural language processing plays a crucial role in adapting to evolving data and preventing catastrophic forgetting. Despite significant progress, existing methods still face challenges, such as inefficient parameter reuse across tasks, risking catastrophic forgetting when tasks are dissimilar, and the unnecessary introduction of new parameters for each task, which hampers knowledge sharing among similar tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a Sparse Adapter Fusion Method (SAFM), which dynamically fuses old and new adapters to address these challenges. SAFM operates in two stages: the decision stage and the tuning stage. In the decision stage, SAFM determines whether to incorporate a new adapter, reuse an existing one, or add an empty adapter. The architecture search procedure, designed to prioritize reusing or adding empty adapters, minimizes parameter consumption and maximizes reuse. In the tuning stage, SAFM especially facilitates a layer-wise loss to encourage differentiation between adapters, effectively capturing knowledge within the same task. Experimental results consistently show that SAFM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving comparable performance while utilizing less than 60% of the parameters.

Conclusion: ORDER框架有效解决了复合材料连续设计空间和数据稀缺的挑战，为复合材料AI设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown remarkable success in materials discovery and property prediction, particularly for crystalline and polymer systems where material properties and structures are dominated by discrete graph representations. Such graph-central paradigm breaks down on composite materials, which possess continuous and nonlinear design spaces that lack well-defined graph structures. General composite descriptors, e.g., fiber volume and misalignment angle, cannot fully capture the fiber distributions that fundamentally determine microstructural characteristics, necessitating the integration of heterogeneous data sources through multimodal learning. Existing alignment-oriented multimodal frameworks have proven effective on abundant crystal or polymer data under discrete, unique graph-property mapping assumptions, but fail to address the highly continuous composite design space under extreme data scarcity. In this work, we introduce ORDinal-aware imagE-tabulaR alignment (ORDER), a multimodal pretraining framework that establishes ordinality as a core principle for composite material representations. ORDER ensures that materials with similar target properties occupy nearby regions in the latent space, which effectively preserves the continuous nature of composite properties and enables meaningful interpolation between sparsely observed designs. We evaluate ORDER on a public Nanofiber-enforced composite dataset and an internally curated dataset that simulates the construction of carbon fiber T700 with diverse fiber distributions. ORDER achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art multimodal baselines across property prediction, cross-modal retrieval, and microstructure generation tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pre-training can actually slow down fine-tuning optimization even when tasks are well-aligned; excessive pre-training induces a prolonged search phase that hinders convergence, as mathematically demonstrated for LoRA fine-tuning on single-index models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The naive intuition that pre-training always facilitates fine-tuning is mathematically questionable; this paper investigates when and why excessive pre-training might computationally hurt fine-tuning performance, specifically for LoRA fine-tuning.

Method: Mathematical analysis of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on single-index models trained under one-pass SGD, using a summary statistics description of fine-tuning dynamics to characterize convergence rates.

Result: Precise characterization of how convergence rate depends on initial fine-tuning alignment and task non-linearity; discovery that strong pre-training can cause a prolonged search phase that slows down fine-tuning even when pre-training and downstream tasks are well-aligned.

Conclusion: Provides a unified theoretical framework showing how pre-training strength and task difficulty jointly shape the dynamics and limitations of LoRA fine-tuning in a nontrivial tractable model, challenging the simplistic view that more pre-training is always beneficial.

Abstract: Pre-training on a source task is usually expected to facilitate fine-tuning on similar downstream problems. In this work, we mathematically show that this naive intuition is not always true: excessive pre-training can computationally slow down fine-tuning optimization. We study this phenomenon for low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on single-index models trained under one-pass SGD. Leveraging a summary statistics description of the fine-tuning dynamics, we precisely characterize how the convergence rate depends on the initial fine-tuning alignment and the degree of non-linearity of the target task. The key take away is that even when the pre-training and down- stream tasks are well aligned, strong pre-training can induce a prolonged search phase and hinder convergence. Our theory thus provides a unified picture of how pre-training strength and task difficulty jointly shape the dynamics and limitations of LoRA fine-tuning in a nontrivial tractable model.

### [120] [GraphDancer: Training LLMs to Explore and Reason over Graphs via Curriculum Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02518)
*Yuyang Bai,Zhuofeng Li,Ping Nie,Jianwen Xie,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphDancer is a reinforcement learning framework that enables moderate-sized LLMs (3B parameters) to navigate heterogeneous knowledge graphs effectively through a curriculum learning approach, outperforming much larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need external knowledge for factuality, but real-world knowledge is often stored as heterogeneous graphs requiring precise function calls and multi-hop reasoning, which current retrieval methods struggle with.

Method: GraphDancer uses reinforcement learning to teach LLMs graph navigation by interleaving reasoning and function execution, with a graph-aware curriculum that schedules training by structural complexity using an easy-to-hard biased sampler.

Result: Despite using only a 3B backbone, GraphDancer outperforms baselines with 14B parameters or GPT-4o-mini on cross-domain and out-of-distribution tasks, demonstrating robust generalization.

Conclusion: RL-based curriculum learning effectively teaches LLMs transferable graph exploration and reasoning skills, enabling smaller models to surpass larger baselines on complex knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external knowledge to improve factuality, yet many real-world knowledge sources are organized as heterogeneous graphs rather than plain text. Reasoning over such graph-structured knowledge poses two key challenges: (1) navigating structured, schema-defined relations requires precise function calls rather than similarity-based retrieval, and (2) answering complex questions often demands multi-hop evidence aggregation through iterative information seeking. We propose GraphDancer, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that teaches LLMs to navigate graphs by interleaving reasoning and function execution. To make RL effective for moderate-sized LLMs, we introduce a graph-aware curriculum that schedules training by the structural complexity of information-seeking trajectories using an easy-to-hard biased sampler. We evaluate GraphDancer on a multi-domain benchmark by training on one domain only and testing on unseen domains and out-of-distribution question types. Despite using only a 3B backbone, GraphDancer outperforms baselines equipped with either a 14B backbone or GPT-4o-mini, demonstrating robust cross-domain generalization of graph exploration and reasoning skills.

TL;DR: 提出缩放点积注意力(SDPA)的数学等价新形式：将输入向量投影到输入自身决定的公共曲面，揭示其发现时变非线性依赖的本质，实现计算加速并提供语言/时序数据的新解释框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统"查询-键-值"数据库概念难以与数学信号处理标准方法兼容，需建立SDPA与信号处理的理论桥梁

Method: 将SDPA重写为输入向量在输入决定的时变公共曲面上的投影，数学等价但形式不同

Result: 1) 加速前向传播和学习算法 2) 揭示SDPA发现输入中时变/上下文依赖的非线性关系 3) 为语言模型提供新解释：通过曲面确定时变上下文意义

Conclusion: 该重构不仅提升计算效率，更从根本上改变了"自注意力"概念，强有力地支持SDPA在具有时变非线性依赖的时序数据中的应用合理性

Abstract: Scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) is a fundamental component responsible for the success of large-language models and other nonlinear signal processing applications. The rationale for SDPA has been based upon "query, key, value" concepts borrowed from database theory, but these concepts are difficult to reconcile with standard methods in mathematical signal processing. We show that SDPA can be rewritten in a different but mathematically equivalent form as a projection of the input vectors onto a common surface determined by the inputs themselves. Therefore SDPA discovers nonlinear dependencies in the input that are time-dependent and context-dependent. The rewritten form of SDPA permits increased speed of both feedforward and learning algorithms, but more importantly suggests potential extensions. In the context of language, we re-interpret the role of SDPA as finding a time-dependent contextual meaning determined by the surface on which the set of input vectors lies. Input token embeddings are then modified by the local context surface. This interpretation differs substantially from the concept of "self-attention", and provides a strong justification for the use of SDPA for time-series data with time-varying local nonlinear dependencies.

*Pengyue Hou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了在递归合成数据训练中，困惑度(PPL)作为监控指标具有欺骗性，发现了一种名为"语义隧道"的新失效模式：模型在保持语法流畅的同时语义多样性完全崩溃。通过应用MNCIS框架的自适应谱负耦合(ASNC)技术，成功将模型有效秩从3.62提升至5.35，阻止了语义吸引子的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑传统困惑度(PPL)在递归合成数据训练中监控AI稳定性的有效性，探究PPL是否无法捕捉模型的语义退化问题，并寻找能够保持长期语义多样性的解决方案。

Method: 采用严格的滑动窗口协议(N=1500)监测模型行为，识别出"语义隧道"现象；应用Hou(2026)提出的多尺度负耦合信息系统(MNCIS)框架，使用自适应谱负耦合(ASNC)作为拓扑算子来诱导"流形展开"。

Result: 发现基线模型在7代内收敛至"Robert Boulton"奇异点，潜在流形全局有效秩从3.62崩溃至2.22；MNCIS-ASNC方法成功将有效秩扩展至5.35，构建了抵抗语义吸引子的人工流形，保持了训练数据的长尾分布。

Conclusion: PPL无法有效检测生成式AI的语义退化；MNCIS框架通过拓扑操作主动展开流形，是防止递归训练中语义多样性崩溃的有效方法，为AI稳定性监控提供了新范式。

Abstract: The stability of generative artificial intelligence trained on recursive synthetic data is conventionally monitored via Perplexity (PPL). We demonstrate that PPL is a deceptive metric in context-stabilized regimes (L=128). Using a rigorous sliding-window protocol (N=1500), we identify a novel failure mode termed "Semantic Tunneling." While the Baseline model maintains high grammatical fluency (PPL approx. 83.9), it suffers a catastrophic loss of semantic diversity, converging within seven generations to a single, low-entropy narrative attractor: the "Robert Boulton" Singularity. This phenomenon represents a total collapse of the latent manifold (Global Effective Rank 3.62 -> 2.22), where the model discards diverse world knowledge to optimize for statistically safe syntactic templates. To address this, we apply the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS) framework recently established in Hou (2026) [arXiv:2601.11594]. We demonstrate that Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) acts as a topological operator that actively induces "Manifold Unfolding." MNCIS forces the model to expand its effective rank from the anisotropic baseline of 3.62 to a hyper-diverse state of 5.35, effectively constructing an "Artificial Manifold" that resists the gravitational pull of semantic attractors and preserves the long-tail distribution of the training data.

*Lixiang Fan,Bohao Li,Tao Zou,Bowen Du,Junchen Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes IGSTGNN, a novel traffic forecasting framework that explicitly models the spatio-temporal impact of sudden incidents (accidents/weather) through two specialized modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a newly released incident-aligned traffic dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph neural network traffic forecasting methods ignore sudden transportation incidents (accidents, adverse weather) that significantly disrupt traffic patterns. This oversight is a major obstacle to accurate prediction, but the unpredictability of incidents makes pattern extraction from historical data difficult.

Method: The authors propose the Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (IGSTGNN) with two core components: (1) an Incident-Context Spatial Fusion (ICSF) module to capture initial heterogeneous spatial influence of incidents, and (2) a Temporal Incident Impact Decay (TIID) module to model the dynamic dissipation of incident effects over time. They also constructed a large-scale dataset with time-aligned incident records and traffic data.

Result: The IGSTGNN framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the new benchmark dataset. Additionally, the ICSF and TIID modules demonstrate generalizability by improving various existing models when integrated.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling incident impacts is crucial for accurate traffic forecasting. The proposed modular approach effectively captures both immediate and decaying spatio-temporal effects of incidents, offering a generalizable solution that can enhance existing forecasting models and improve intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of deep-learning-based, graph-neural-network-based forecasting methods for modern intelligent transportation systems. However, most existing work focuses exclusively on capturing spatio-temporal dependencies from historical traffic data, while overlooking the fact that suddenly occurring transportation incidents, such as traffic accidents and adverse weather, serve as external disturbances that can substantially alter temporal patterns. We argue that this issue has become a major obstacle to modeling the dynamics of traffic systems and improving prediction accuracy, but the unpredictability of incidents makes it difficult to observe patterns from historical sequences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework named the Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (IGSTGNN). IGSTGNN explicitly models the incident's impact through two core components: an Incident-Context Spatial Fusion (ICSF) module to capture the initial heterogeneous spatial influence, and a Temporal Incident Impact Decay (TIID) module to model the subsequent dynamic dissipation. To facilitate research on the spatio-temporal impact of incidents on traffic flow, a large-scale dataset is constructed and released, featuring incident records that are time-aligned with traffic time series. On this new benchmark, the proposed IGSTGNN framework is demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the generalizability of the ICSF and TIID modules is validated by integrating them into various existing models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential to transform real-world decision-making systems by enabling autonomous agents to learn from experience. Deploying RL in real-world settings, especially in the context of human-robot interaction, requires defining state representations and reward functions, which are critical for learning efficiency and policy performance. Traditional RL approaches often rely on domain expertise and trial-and-error, necessitating extensive human involvement as well as direct interaction with the environment, which can be costly and impractical, especially in complex and safety-critical applications. This work proposes a novel RL framework that leverages off-policy evaluation (OPE) for state space and reward function selection, using only logged interaction data. This approach eliminates the need for real-time access to the environment or human-in-the-loop feedback, greatly reducing the dependency on costly real-time interactions. The proposed approach systematically evaluates multiple candidate state representations and reward functions by training offline RL agents and applying OPE to estimate policy performance. The optimal state space and reward function are selected based on their ability to produce high-performing policies under OPE metrics. Our method is validated on two environments: the Lunar Lander environment by OpenAI Gym, which provides a controlled setting for assessing state space and reward function selection, and a NASA-MATB-II human subjects study environment, which evaluates the approach's real-world applicability to human-robot teaming scenarios. This work enhances the feasibility and scalability of offline RL for real-world environments by automating critical RL design decisions through a data-driven OPE-based evaluation, enabling more reliable, effective, and sustainable RL formulation for complex human-robot interaction settings.

Abstract: The hypersonic unstart phenomenon poses a major challenge to reliable air-breathing propulsion at Mach 5 and above, where strong shock-boundary-layer interactions and rapid pressure fluctuations can destabilize inlet operation. Here, we demonstrate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)- based active flow control strategy to control unstart in a canonical two-dimensional hypersonic inlet at Mach 5 and Reynolds number $5\times 10^6$. The in-house CFD solver enables high-fidelity simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, resolving key flow features, including shock motion, boundary-layer dynamics, and flow separation, that are essential for learning physically consistent control policies suitable for real-time deployment. The DRL controller robustly stabilizes the inlet over a wide range of back pressures representative of varying combustion chamber conditions. It further generalizes to previously unseen scenarios, including different back-pressure levels, Reynolds numbers, and sensor configurations, while operating with noisy measurements, thereby demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization. Control remains robust in the presence of noisy sensor measurements, and a minimal, optimally selected sensor set achieves comparable performance, enabling practical implementation. These results establish a data-driven approach for real-time hypersonic flow control under realistic operational uncertainties.

Motivation: 迁移学习旨在降低深度强化学习的高样本复杂度，但现有方法难以应对源域与目标域间的域偏移问题。策略蒸馏缺乏长期策略知识迁移能力，而自动机方法虽能捕获任务结构却缺少细粒度动作指导。

Method: 上下文感知蒸馏与经验门控迁移（CADENT）框架将基于自动机的策略知识与策略级战术知识融合为一致指导信号，核心创新是经验门控信任机制，可在状态-动作层面动态权衡教师指导与学生经验，实现向目标域的优雅适应。

Conclusion: CADENT通过动态权衡指导信号与自身经验，为目标域自适应知识迁移提供了稳健方法。

Abstract: Transfer learning promises to reduce the high sample complexity of deep reinforcement learning (RL), yet existing methods struggle with domain shift between source and target environments. Policy distillation provides powerful tactical guidance but fails to transfer long-term strategic knowledge, while automaton-based methods capture task structure but lack fine-grained action guidance. This paper introduces Context-Aware Distillation with Experience-gated Transfer (CADENT), a framework that unifies strategic automaton-based knowledge with tactical policy-level knowledge into a coherent guidance signal. CADENT's key innovation is an experience-gated trust mechanism that dynamically weighs teacher guidance against the student's own experience at the state-action level, enabling graceful adaptation to target domain specifics. Across challenging environments, from sparse-reward grid worlds to continuous control tasks, CADENT achieves 40-60\% better sample efficiency than baselines while maintaining superior asymptotic performance, establishing a robust approach for adaptive knowledge transfer in RL.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines AI with human expertise to provide transparent ADHD diagnosis assistance, demonstrating strong potential for clinical application and building trust between computational systems and psychologists.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is challenging to diagnose and requires advanced approaches for reliable and transparent identification and classification. It is characterized by a pattern of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that is more severe and more frequent than in individuals with a comparable level of development. In this paper, an explainable framework based on a fine-tuned hybrid Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called HyExDNN-RNN model is proposed for ADHD detection, multi-class categorization, and decision interpretation. This framework not only detects ADHD, but also provides interpretable insights into the diagnostic process so that psychologists can better understand and trust the results of the diagnosis. We use the Pearson correlation coefficient for optimal feature selection and machine and deep learning models for experimental analysis and comparison. We use a standardized technique for feature reduction, model selection and interpretation to accurately determine the diagnosis rate and ensure the interpretability of the proposed framework. Our framework provided excellent results on binary classification, with HyExDNN-RNN achieving an F1 score of 99% and 94.2% on multi-class categorization. XAI approaches, in particular SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), provided important insights into the importance of features and the decision logic of models. By combining AI with human expertise, we aim to bridge the gap between advanced computational techniques and practical psychological applications. These results demonstrate the potential of our framework to assist in ADHD diagnosis and interpretation.

Conclusion: 多属性轨迹推理方法为多模态审核提供高效框架，有效缓解多任务目标间的干扰问题

Abstract: Safety moderation is pivotal for identifying harmful content. Despite the success of textual safety moderation, its multimodal counterparts remain hindered by a dual sparsity of data and supervision. Conventional reliance on binary labels lead to shortcut learning, which obscures the intrinsic classification boundaries necessary for effective multimodal discrimination. Hence, we propose a novel learning paradigm (UniMod) that transitions from sparse decision-making to dense reasoning traces. By constructing structured trajectories encompassing evidence grounding, modality assessment, risk mapping, policy decision, and response generation, we reformulate monolithic decision tasks into a multi-dimensional boundary learning process. This approach forces the model to ground its decision in explicit safety semantics, preventing the model from converging on superficial shortcuts. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a multi-head scalar reward model (UniRM). UniRM provides multi-dimensional supervision by assigning attribute-level scores to the response generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce specialized optimization strategies to decouple task-specific parameters and rebalance training dynamics, effectively resolving interference between diverse objectives in multi-task learning. Empirical results show UniMod achieves competitive textual moderation performance and sets a new multimodal benchmark using less than 40\% of the training data used by leading baselines. Ablations further validate our multi-attribute trajectory reasoning, offering an effective and efficient framework for multimodal moderation.

Result: FAQ在性能上持续优于先前方法，额外成本可忽略，无需反向传播、数据重建或调优，适合边缘部署。

Conclusion: FAQ是一种高效有效的PTQ方法，通过考虑未来层信息改善量化质量，且无显著计算开销。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a widely used method to compress large language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning. It typically sets quantization hyperparameters (e.g., scaling factors) based on current-layer activations. Although this method is efficient, it suffers from quantization bias and error accumulation, resulting in suboptimal and unstable quantization, especially when the calibration data is biased. To overcome these issues, we propose Future-Aware Quantization (FAQ), which leverages future-layer activations to guide quantization. This allows better identification and preservation of important weights, while reducing sensitivity to calibration noise. We further introduce a window-wise preview mechanism to softly aggregate multiple future-layer activations, mitigating over-reliance on any single layer. To avoid expensive greedy search, we use a pre-searched configuration to minimize overhead. Experiments show that FAQ consistently outperforms prior methods with negligible extra cost, requiring no backward passes, data reconstruction, or tuning, making it well-suited for edge deployment.

Abstract: Recent vision-centric approaches have made significant strides in long-context modeling. Represented by DeepSeek-OCR, these models encode rendered text into continuous vision tokens, achieving high compression rates without sacrificing recognition precision. However, viewing the vision encoder as a lossy channel with finite representational capacity raises a fundamental question: what is the information upper bound of visual tokens? To investigate this limit, we conduct controlled stress tests by progressively increasing the information quantity (character count) within an image. We observe a distinct phase-transition phenomenon characterized by three regimes: a near-perfect Stable Phase, an Instability Phase marked by increased error variance, and a total Collapse Phase. We analyze the mechanical origins of these transitions and identify key factors. Furthermore, we formulate a probabilistic scaling law that unifies average vision token load and visual density into a latent difficulty metric. Extensive experiments across various Vision-Language Models demonstrate the universality of this scaling law, providing critical empirical guidance for optimizing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in visual context compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning for HAR relies heavily on manual data augmentation strategies that lack generalizability and flexibility, especially for low-semantic sensor signals with noise and redundancy.

Method: AutoCL uses a Siamese network architecture with shared backbone parameters and an embedded generator to learn auto-augmentation in latent space. It includes a stop-gradient design and correlation reduction strategy to enhance representation learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on four widely-used HAR datasets demonstrate that AutoCL significantly improves recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed AutoCL method effectively reduces manual augmentation burden and achieves superior performance for wearable-based human activity recognition.

Abstract: For low-semantic sensor signals from human activity recognition (HAR), contrastive learning (CL) is essential to implement novel applications or generic models without manual annotation, which is a high-performance self-supervised learning (SSL) method. However, CL relies heavily on data augmentation for pairwise comparisons. Especially for low semantic data in the HAR area, conducting good performance augmentation strategies in pretext tasks still rely on manual attempts lacking generalizability and flexibility. To reduce the augmentation burden, we propose an end-to-end auto-augmentation contrastive learning (AutoCL) method for wearable-based HAR. AutoCL is based on a Siamese network architecture that shares the parameters of the backbone and with a generator embedded to learn auto-augmentation. AutoCL trains the generator based on the representation in the latent space to overcome the disturbances caused by noise and redundant information in raw sensor data. The architecture empirical study indicates the effectiveness of this design. Furthermore, we propose a stop-gradient design and correlation reduction strategy in AutoCL to enhance encoder representation learning. Extensive experiments based on four wide-used HAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed AutoCL method significantly improves recognition accuracy compared with other SOTA methods.

Result: NAS使代表性L&E算法的崩溃点延迟超过4倍，编辑性能获得72.2%的平均相对提升，仅需增加一行代码且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: NAS为LLM模型顺序编辑中的崩溃问题提供了有效、极简且高效的解决方案，显著提升了编辑稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Model editing has emerged as a practical approach for mitigating factual errors and outdated knowledge in large language models (LLMs). Among existing methods, the Locate-and-Edit (L&E) paradigm is the dominant framework: it locates MLP parameters implicated in expressing a target fact, and then performs a localized update to rewrite that fact. However, long sequences of edits often trigger abrupt model collapse in L&E beyond a critical point. We empirically identify a strong correlation between collapse and explosive growth of edited MLP weight norms, and formally prove that commonly used L&E update rules can induce exponential norm growth across sequential edits in the absence of explicit norm control. To address this issue, we propose Norm-Anchor Scaling NAS, a plug-and-play norm-constrained strategy. Across extensive experiments, NAS delays the collapse point of representative L&E algorithms by more than 4 times and yields a 72.2% average relative gain in editing performance, requiring only a single additional line of code and incurring negligible computational overhead.

*Dayu Wang,Jiaye Yang,Weikang Li,Jiahui Liang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了RL无法扩展LLM推理能力超出预训练低秩偏置流形的假设。提出MRPO几何框架，结合谱正交探索和有效秩正则化重塑推理空间，使4B参数模型在数学任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究质疑RLVR是否真正扩展了LLM推理能力，还是仅对齐了被低秩偏置流形限制的现有潜在能力，认为探索受限于预训练模型的流形。

Method: 提出流形重塑策略优化(MRPO)，分两阶段：(1)谱正交探索(SOE)将策略初始化偏移至偏置流形的零空间；(2)在策略优化目标中集成有效秩正则化项，激励发现并保持高维推理轨迹。

Result: 4B参数的MRPO方法在数学任务上达到最先进性能，显著优于Qwen3-32B等更大模型，并将能力边界扩展到标准GRPO之外。

Conclusion: LLM的潜在推理空间可通过目标几何干预从根本上扩展，挑战了可及性边界假设，证明RL确实能增加超出预训练流形的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, recent studies question whether RL genuinely expands reasoning capacity or merely aligns existing latent capabilities, arguing that exploration remains confined within the pre-trained model's low-rank bias manifold. In this work, we challenge this accessibility boundary hypothesis by demonstrating that the latent reasoning space can be fundamentally expanded through targeted geometric interventions. We propose Manifold-Reshaping Policy Optimization (MRPO), a geometric framework designed to fundamentally restructure the inference space of LLMs. MRPO operates in two stages: first, we employ Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE) to eject the policy initialization into the null space of the bias manifold; second, we integrate an Effective Rank regularization term into the policy optimization objective. This approach incentivizes the discovery and maintenance of high-dimensional reasoning trajectories against the entropy-reducing tendency of standard RL. Empirically, our 4B-parameter method achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical tasks, significantly outperforming larger models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and expanding the capability boundary beyond standard GRPO.

*Xianglong Yan,ChengZhu Bao,Zhiteng Li,Tianao Zhang,Shaoqiu Zhang,Ruobing Xie,Samm Sun,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D²Quant是一种新颖的权重-only训练后量化框架，通过双尺度量化器(DSQ)处理下投影矩阵，并结合偏差感知校正(DAC)来修正激活分布偏移，在亚4比特精度下显著提升了大型语言模型的量化准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能强大，但高计算和内存成本使其在资源受限场景下部署困难。权重-only训练后量化虽能减少内存占用并实现加速，但在亚4比特精度下准确率显著下降，主要由于下投影矩阵的量化瓶颈和权重量化引起的激活偏差缺乏有效校正策略。

Method: 提出D²Quant框架，包含两个核心组件：1)双尺度量化器(DSQ)，专为下投影矩阵设计，通过可吸收的缩放因子在不增加比特预算的前提下大幅提升精度；2)偏差感知校正(DAC)，在LayerNorm中引入均值偏移校正来缓解量化引起的激活分布偏移。

Result: 在多系列大型语言模型和评估指标的广泛实验表明，D²Quant在亚4比特精度的权重-only训练后量化中实现了卓越性能。

Conclusion: D²Quant从权重和激活两个角度有效解决了权重-only量化的核心挑战，为资源受限环境下部署大型语言模型提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance, but their high compute and memory costs make deployment difficult in resource-constrained scenarios. Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) is appealing, as it reduces memory usage and enables practical speedup without low-bit operators or specialized hardware. However, accuracy often degrades significantly in weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision, and our analysis identifies two main causes: (1) down-projection matrices are a well-known quantization bottleneck, but maintaining their fidelity often requires extra bit-width; (2) weight quantization induces activation deviations, but effective correction strategies remain underexplored. To address these issues, we propose D$^2$Quant, a novel weight-only PTQ framework that improves quantization from both the weight and activation perspectives. On the weight side, we design a Dual-Scale Quantizer (DSQ) tailored to down-projection matrices, with an absorbable scaling factor that significantly improves accuracy without increasing the bit budget. On the activation side, we propose Deviation-Aware Correction (DAC), which incorporates a mean-shift correction within LayerNorm to mitigate quantization-induced activation distribution shifts. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics show that D$^2$Quant delivers superior performance for weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/XIANGLONGYAN/D2Quant.

TL;DR: ToolTok通过多步路径规划和可学习工具令牌解决GUI智能体的泛化问题，在少量数据下实现优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI智能体模型在应对不同输入分辨率和宽高比时存在泛化困难，且面临数据稀缺问题。基于坐标的单步视觉定位方法适应性差，而无坐标替代方案又受困于严重的数据不足。

Method: 提出ToolTok新范式，将操作建模为渐进式工具使用序列。设计符合人类交互习惯的工具，使用可学习令牌嵌入表示。引入语义锚定机制为工具提供语义相关概念作为归纳偏置。构建由易到难的三阶段课程学习：令牌定义问答、纯文本引导工具选择和简化视觉路径规划。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ToolTok在4B参数规模下表现优异，可与235B大模型竞争，仅使用其他方法不到1%的训练数据，并展现出强大的未见场景泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToolTok通过创新的多步工具使用框架和高效的小样本学习机制，显著提升了GUI智能体的泛化能力和数据效率，为资源受限场景下的智能体训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing GUI agent models relying on coordinate-based one-step visual grounding struggle with generalizing to varying input resolutions and aspect ratios. Alternatives introduce coordinate-free strategies yet suffer from learning under severe data scarcity. To address the limitations, we propose ToolTok, a novel paradigm of multi-step pathfinding for GUI agents, where operations are modeled as a sequence of progressive tool usage. Specifically, we devise tools aligned with human interaction habits and represent each tool using learnable token embeddings. To enable efficient embedding learning under limited supervision, ToolTok introduces a semantic anchoring mechanism that grounds each tool with semantically related concepts as natural inductive bias. To further enable a pre-trained large language model to progressively acquire tool semantics, we construct an easy-to-hard curriculum consisting of three tasks: token definition question-answering, pure text-guided tool selection, and simplified visual pathfinding. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ToolTok achieves superior performance among models of comparable scale (4B) and remains competitive with a substantially larger model (235B). Notably, these results are obtained using less than 1% of the training data required by other post-training approaches. In addition, ToolTok demonstrates strong generalization across unseen scenarios. Our training & inference code is open-source at https://github.com/ZephinueCode/ToolTok.

TL;DR: 提出HyPAC方法，通过自适应路由输入到不同成本-质量的标注源（如LLM、推理模型、人类专家），在保证标注错误率的前提下实现最低预期成本，在基准测试中降低78.51%标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据标注涉及多个具有不同成本-质量权衡的来源（如快速大语言模型、慢速推理模型和人类专家），需要实现在控制测试实例标注错误率的同时，将输入路由到最具成本效益的标注源。

Method: HyPAC方法通过重要性采样和上置信界校准两个决策阈值，基于不确定性将输入划分为三个区域，并路由到相应的标注源。该方法提供分布无关的标注错误率保证。

Result: 在常见基准测试中，该方法实现了78.51%的标注成本降低，同时严格控制在标注错误率范围内，并达到了最小预期成本。

Conclusion: HyPAC方法能够在无数据分布和预训练模型假设的条件下，以概率近似正确（PAC）保证实现成本最优的自适应标注路由。

Abstract: Data annotation often involves multiple sources with different cost-quality trade-offs, such as fast large language models (LLMs), slow reasoning models, and human experts. In this work, we study the problem of routing inputs to the most cost-efficient annotation source while controlling the labeling error on test instances. We propose \textbf{HyPAC}, a method that adaptively labels inputs to the most cost-efficient annotation source while providing distribution-free guarantees on annotation error. HyPAC calibrates two decision thresholds using importance sampling and upper confidence bounds, partitioning inputs into three regions based on uncertainty and routing each to the appropriate annotation source. We prove that HyPAC achieves the minimum expected cost with a probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee on the annotation error, free of data distribution and pre-trained models. Experiments on common benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, reducing the annotation cost by 78.51\% while tightly controlling the annotation error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer基础模型在时序预测和图像分割等任务中取得显著进展，但仍存在多变量长序列预测中的误差累积问题、图像任务中对分布外样本的脆弱性，这些问题在涉及复杂时序模式和多模态特征的大规模Web数据分析中尤为突出，高维参数空间中的优化困难导致模型容易陷入鞍点。

Method: 提出一种轻量级Transformer架构与新型Escape-Explore优化器(EEO)相结合的方法，该优化器能够增强探索能力和泛化性能，同时有效避免尖锐最小值和鞍点陷阱。

Result: 在代表性Web数据场景下的实验表明，该方法在11个时序基准数据集和Synapse医学图像分割任务上达到与当前最优模型相当的性能，同时展现出更优的泛化能力和稳定性。

Conclusion: 验证了该方法作为通用跨任务基础模型在Web规模数据挖掘和分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models have achieved remarkable progress in tasks such as time-series forecasting and image segmentation. However, they frequently suffer from error accumulation in multivariate long-sequence prediction and exhibit vulnerability to out-of-distribution samples in image-related tasks. Furthermore, these challenges become particularly pronounced in large-scale Web data analysis tasks, which typically involve complex temporal patterns and multimodal features. This complexity substantially increases optimization difficulty, rendering models prone to stagnation at saddle points within high-dimensional parameter spaces. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight Transformer architecture in conjunction with a novel Escape-Explore Optimizer (EEO). The optimizer enhances both exploration and generalization while effectively avoiding sharp minima and saddle-point traps. Experimental results show that, in representative Web data scenarios, our method achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art models across 11 time-series benchmark datasets and the Synapse medical image segmentation task. Moreover, it demonstrates superior generalization and stability, thereby validating its potential as a versatile cross-task foundation model for Web-scale data mining and analysis.

TL;DR: BatCoder是一个自监督强化学习框架，通过代码与文档的互转和语义相似度奖励，实现仅用代码训练即达到SOTA水平的代码生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码任务训练依赖高质量代码-文档对，但这类数据成本高昂且稀缺，尤其在小众编程语言上，严重限制了模型性能。

Method: 采用回译策略：从代码生成文档，再用生成的文档重构原始代码。通过原始代码与重构代码的语义相似度作为隐式奖励，进行强化学习，从而无需配对数据即可联合优化代码生成和文档生成能力。

Result: 7B模型在HumanEval和MBPP上分别达到83.5%和81.0%的pass@1，超越开源基线，且在训练数据量和模型规模上均呈现稳定扩展性。

Conclusion: BatCoder通过自监督方式仅需代码即可训练，大幅扩展了可用训练样本，在代码生成任务上实现高性能且具备良好扩展性。

Abstract: Training LLMs for code-related tasks typically depends on high-quality code-documentation pairs, which are costly to curate and often scarce for niche programming languages. We introduce BatCoder, a self-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly optimize code generation and documentation production. BatCoder employs a back-translation strategy: a documentation is first generated from code, and then the generated documentation is used to reconstruct the original code. The semantic similarity between the original and reconstructed code serves as an implicit reward, enabling reinforcement learning to improve the model's performance both in generating code from documentation and vice versa. This approach allows models to be trained using only code, substantially increasing the available training examples. Evaluated on HumanEval and MBPP with a 7B model, BatCoder achieved 83.5% and 81.0% pass@1, outperforming strong open-source baselines. Moreover, the framework demonstrates consistent scaling with respect to both training corpus size and model capacity.

TL;DR: PSN-RLVR通过扰动策略参数实现LLM推理的轨迹级探索，在数学推理基准测试中超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在LLM推理中存在探索天花板问题：它倾向于重加权现有解法轨迹而非发现新策略，导致在大采样预算下性能受限

Method: 提出PSN-RLVR：在回滚生成前扰动策略参数以实现时间一致的轨迹级探索；使用截断重要性采样(TIS)缓解采样-更新不匹配；设计基于语义多样性和归一化自确定性的轻量级实时自适应噪声调度器；在GRPO上实例化为PSN-GRPO

Result: 在多个数学推理基准和模型家族上持续扩展有效推理能力边界；在大采样预算下获得更高的pass-at-k；优于先前探索导向的RLVR方法；具有正交性可组合获得额外增益

Conclusion: PSN-RLVR通过策略空间扰动有效解决RLVR的探索天花板问题，促进新推理策略发现，在数学推理任务上实现更优性能

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves LLM reasoning, yet growing evidence indicates an exploration ceiling: it often reweights existing solution traces rather than discovering new strategies, limiting gains under large sampling budgets (e.g., pass-at-256). We address this limitation with PSN-RLVR, which perturbs policy parameters before rollout generation to induce temporally consistent, trajectory-level exploration that better preserves long-horizon chain-of-thought coherence than action-space noise. To mitigate the resulting sampling-update mismatch, we incorporate truncated importance sampling (TIS). To avoid expensive KL-based adaptive noise control, we propose a computationally efficient real-time adaptive noise scheduler driven by a lightweight surrogate that combines semantic diversity with normalized self-certainty. Instantiated on GRPO, a widely used RLVR method, PSN-GRPO consistently expands the effective reasoning capability boundary across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and model families, yielding higher pass-at-k under large sampling budgets and outperforming prior exploration-oriented RLVR methods (e.g., Pass-at-k-style training) while remaining orthogonal and thus composable for additional gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型常重复推理错误且经验复用依赖外部检索（引入噪声、增加延迟），需实现高效内部经验学习

Method: 设计轻量级可插拔SEAM模块：1) 参数化存储经验；2) 单前向传播生成实例化经验指导；3) 通过执行器推演和GRPO训练模块效用（保持主模型冻结）；4) 部署后可基于成功轨迹进行监督微调

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，不同执行器均获得持续准确率提升，系统开销低

Conclusion: SEAM通过结构化经验适配机制有效提升模型性能与鲁棒性，为模型经验学习提供新范式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are largely static and often redo reasoning or repeat mistakes. Prior experience reuse typically relies on external retrieval, which is similarity-based, can introduce noise, and adds latency. We introduce SEAM (Structured Experience Adapter Module), a lightweight, executor-specific plug-in that stores experience in its parameters and generates a structured, instance-tailored experience entry in a single forward pass to guide a frozen LLM executor. SEAM is trained for utility via executor rollouts and GRPO while keeping the executor frozen, and it can be further improved after deployment with supervised fine-tuning on logged successful trajectories. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains across executors with low overhead. Extensive ablations and analyses further elucidate the mechanisms underlying SEAM's effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了文本越狱攻击向音频模态的跨模态迁移现象，发现多模态模型中的模态对齐会无意中传播文本漏洞到音频模态（即"对齐诅咒"），且文本转音频的越狱攻击效果优于或与现有音频攻击相当，可作为未来音频红队测试的强基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着端到端多模态模型的发展，音频越狱攻击研究兴起，但文本与音频越狱之间的跨模态迁移仍未被探索。鉴于两种模态的语义相似性和文本越狱方法的成熟度，研究文本到音频的越狱攻击迁移具有重要价值。

Method: 首先分析模态对齐与跨模态越狱迁移的关系；然后在最新多模态模型上，对文本越狱、文本转音频越狱和现有音频越狱进行实证评估；进一步验证跨模型迁移性，并在更严格的纯音频访问威胁模型下测试攻击效果。

Result: 强模态对齐会无意中将文本漏洞传播到音频模态（对齐诅咒）；文本转音频越狱攻击性能与现有音频攻击相当甚至更优，成为音频红队测试的简单而强力的基线；攻击具有强跨模型迁移性；在纯音频访问限制下仍然有效。

Conclusion: 模态对齐在多模态模型中引入了新的安全风险，文本到音频的越狱迁移是一种高效且实用的攻击方式，为未来音频安全红队测试提供了重要基线，并揭示了多模态模型安全对齐需要更细致的考量。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end trained omni-models have significantly improved multimodal understanding. At the same time, safety red-teaming has expanded beyond text to encompass audio-based jailbreak attacks. However, an important bridge between textual and audio jailbreaks remains underexplored. In this work, we study the cross-modality transfer of jailbreak attacks from text to audio, motivated by the semantic similarity between the two modalities and the maturity of textual jailbreak methods. We first analyze the connection between modality alignment and cross-modality jailbreak transfer, showing that strong alignment can inadvertently propagate textual vulnerabilities to the audio modality, which we term the alignment curse. Guided by this analysis, we conduct an empirical evaluation of textual jailbreaks, text-transferred audio jailbreaks, and existing audio-based jailbreaks on recent omni-models. Our results show that text-transferred audio jailbreaks perform comparably to, and often better than, audio-based jailbreaks, establishing them as simple yet powerful baselines for future audio red-teaming. We further demonstrate strong cross-model transferability and show that text-transferred audio attacks remain effective even under a stricter audio-only access threat model.

Motivation: 肺癌居癌症死亡率首位，亟需自动化筛查工具。现有Sybil深度学习模型仅通过观察性指标验证，缺乏对其推理机制的因果验证，临床部署前需确保决策稳健性

Method: 开发模型无关的S(H)NAP审计框架，采用3D扩散桥生成模型系统修改解剖特征，构建经放射科专家验证的生成式干预归因，分离特定对象对风险评分的因果贡献

Result: 完成Sybil首次干预性审计：模型虽能区分恶性/良性肺结节，但存在危险失效模式——对临床无依据的伪影过度敏感，并表现出明显的径向偏见

Conclusion: Sybil在展现专家级行为的同时存在关键缺陷，需解决伪影敏感性和径向偏见问题方可安全投入临床使用

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, driving the development of automated screening tools to alleviate radiologist workload. Standing at the frontier of this effort is Sybil, a deep learning model capable of predicting future risk solely from computed tomography (CT) with high precision. However, despite extensive clinical validation, current assessments rely purely on observational metrics. This correlation-based approach overlooks the model's actual reasoning mechanism, necessitating a shift to causal verification to ensure robust decision-making before clinical deployment. We propose S(H)NAP, a model-agnostic auditing framework that constructs generative interventional attributions validated by expert radiologists. By leveraging realistic 3D diffusion bridge modeling to systematically modify anatomical features, our approach isolates object-specific causal contributions to the risk score. Providing the first interventional audit of Sybil, we demonstrate that while the model often exhibits behavior akin to an expert radiologist, differentiating malignant pulmonary nodules from benign ones, it suffers from critical failure modes, including dangerous sensitivity to clinically unjustified artifacts and a distinct radial bias.

Motivation: 现有关于预测性警务系统（如洛杉矶和巴尔的摩部署的）存在种族偏见和不公平性的讨论较多，但缺乏对预测性警务与传统热点警务的全面比较研究，尤其需探究反馈循环和历史偏见数据对公平性的影响。

Method: 在巴尔的摩开展一项综合性比较模拟研究，通过仿真模型对比预测性警务技术与传统热点警务在公平性和准确性上的表现，重点分析反馈循环对偏见的影响及长期行为趋势。

Result: 1. 预测性警务和热点警务均因反馈循环产生偏见；
2. 短期內预测性警务比热点警务更公平且准确；
3. 预测性警务偏见放大速度更快，长期表现可能更差；
4. 在巴尔的摩部分案例中，系统偏见表现为对白人社区的过度监管（与既往研究结论相反）。

Conclusion: 预测性警务的偏见问题比此前认知更复杂，需针对具体城市进行定制化评估；模拟方法能有效揭示系统不公和长期行为倾向，为优化警务策略提供依据。

Abstract: There are ongoing discussions about predictive policing systems, such as those deployed in Los Angeles, California and Baltimore, Maryland, being unfair, for example, by exhibiting racial bias. Studies found that unfairness may be due to feedback loops and being trained on historically biased recorded data. However, comparative studies on predictive policing systems are few and are not sufficiently comprehensive. In this work, we perform a comprehensive comparative simulation study on the fairness and accuracy of predictive policing technologies in Baltimore. Our results suggest that the situation around bias in predictive policing is more complex than was previously assumed. While predictive policing exhibited bias due to feedback loops as was previously reported, we found that the traditional alternative, hot spots policing, had similar issues. Predictive policing was found to be more fair and accurate than hot spots policing in the short term, although it amplified bias faster, suggesting the potential for worse long-run behavior. In Baltimore, in some cases the bias in these systems tended toward over-policing in White neighborhoods, unlike in previous studies. Overall, this work demonstrates a methodology for city-specific evaluation and behavioral-tendency comparison of predictive policing systems, showing how such simulations can reveal inequities and long-term tendencies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IceBench-S2S, the first comprehensive benchmark for 180-day Arctic sea ice forecasting, using a deep learning framework that compresses spatial features into latent space and models temporal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for Arctic sea ice forecasting are limited to daily subseasonal scales (up to 6 months) or monthly averages, which is insufficient for real-world operational applications like maritime transportation planning and scientific investigations that require seasonal-scale forecasts.

Method: The authors propose IceBench-S2S, a comprehensive benchmark that uses a generalized framework to first compress daily sea ice spatial features into a deep latent space, then models temporally concatenated deep features with various DL backbones to predict sea ice variation over successive 180-day periods, providing a unified training and evaluation pipeline.

Result: The study establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating DL approaches in forecasting Arctic sea ice concentration at seasonal scale, offering a unified pipeline for different backbones and practical guidance for model selection in polar environmental monitoring.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between current DL model capabilities and operational needs by enabling skillful seasonal-scale forecasting, which is crucial for maritime planning and scientific activities in the Arctic region.

Abstract: Arctic sea ice plays a critical role in regulating Earth's climate system, significantly influencing polar ecological stability and human activities in coastal regions. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have facilitated the development of skillful pan-Arctic sea ice forecasting systems, where data-driven approaches showcase tremendous potential to outperform conventional physics-based numerical models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and forecasting lead times. Despite the latest progress made by deep learning (DL) forecasting models, most of their skillful forecasting lead times are confined to daily subseasonal scale and monthly averaged values for up to six months, which drastically hinders their deployment for real-world applications, e.g., maritime routine planning for Arctic transportation and scientific investigation. Extending daily forecasts from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) scale is scientifically crucial for operational applications. To bridge the gap between the forecasting lead time of current DL models and the significant daily S2S scale, we introduce IceBench-S2S, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating DL approaches in mitigating the challenge of forecasting Arctic sea ice concentration in successive 180-day periods. It proposes a generalized framework that first compresses spatial features of daily sea ice data into a deep latent space. The temporally concatenated deep features are subsequently modeled by DL-based forecasting backbones to predict the sea ice variation at S2S scale. IceBench-S2S provides a unified training and evaluation pipeline for different backbones, along with practical guidance for model selection in polar environmental monitoring tasks.

Method: HTCL结合快速局部适应和保守的二阶全局整合，通过识别最佳组内任务序列，并使用海森正则化的泰勒展开进行整合，支持L级分层结构以实现多尺度知识整合。

Result: HTCL作为模型无关的整合层，在多种数据集和基线方法上，平均精度提升7%至25%，并在随机任务排列下将最终精度的标准差降低高达68%。

Conclusion: HTCL能有效增强持续学习性能，减少对任务顺序的敏感性，提供理论保证的多尺度知识整合，适用于各种持续学习场景。

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{Hierarchical Taylor Series-based Continual Learning (HTCL)}$, a framework that couples fast local adaptation with conservative, second-order global consolidation to address the high variance introduced by random task ordering. To address task-order effects, HTCL identifies the best intra-group task sequence and integrates the resulting local updates through a Hessian-regularized Taylor expansion, yielding a consolidation step with theoretical guarantees. The approach naturally extends to an $L$-level hierarchy, enabling multiscale knowledge integration in a manner not supported by conventional single-level CL systems. Across a wide range of datasets and replay and regularization baselines, HTCL acts as a model-agnostic consolidation layer that consistently enhances performance, yielding mean accuracy gains of $7\%$ to $25\%$ while reducing the standard deviation of final accuracy by up to $68\%$ across random task permutations.

*Haichuan Wang,Tao Lin,Lingkai Kong,Ce Li,Hezi Jiang,Milind Tambe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文针对LLM对齐中KL正则化导致基策略偏见继承的问题，将奖励模型优化建模为Stackelberg博弈，提出一种简单的奖励塑形方案，在推理时对齐设置中实现平均奖励持续提升，对比基线的胜率-平局率超过66%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法直接使用用户偏好数据训练的奖励模型并施以KL正则化，会导致LLM继承与用户偏好冲突的基策略偏见。虽然放大奖励可缓解偏见，但会增加奖励劫持风险，需要最优设计KL正则化下的奖励模型。

Method: 将奖励模型优化问题形式化为Stackelberg博弈，设计简单的奖励塑形机制来逼近最优奖励模型，该方法能以极低开销无缝集成到现有对齐框架中。

Result: 在推理时对齐的实验评估中，所提方法持续提升平均奖励，在所有评估设置下对比基线的平均胜率-平局率超过66%。

Conclusion: 该奖励塑形方案有效解决了对齐过程中的偏见继承与奖励劫持权衡问题，为现有对齐方法提供了简洁而有效的改进。

Abstract: Existing alignment methods directly use the reward model learned from user preference data to optimize an LLM policy, subject to KL regularization with respect to the base policy. This practice is suboptimal for maximizing user's utility because the KL regularization may cause the LLM to inherit the bias in the base policy that conflicts with user preferences. While amplifying rewards for preferred outputs can mitigate this bias, it also increases the risk of reward hacking. This tradeoff motivates the problem of optimally designing reward models under KL regularization. We formalize this reward model optimization problem as a Stackelberg game, and show that a simple reward shaping scheme can effectively approximate the optimal reward model. We empirically evaluate our method in inference-time alignment settings and demonstrate that it integrates seamlessly into existing alignment methods with minimal overhead. Our method consistently improves average reward and achieves win-tie rates exceeding 66% against all baselines, averaged across evaluation settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出QuantLRM方法，利用推理微调中权重更新的幅度信号（特别是极值更新）进行大模型量化，通过拟合二次函数计算通道重要性，在四个推理基准上平均提升6.55%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重量化对压缩大语言模型至关重要。受经典幅度剪枝启发，研究推理微调过程中权重更新幅度是否为量化大推理模型提供有效信号，并提出"保护两端"假设：最小和最大的权重更新比中等幅度更重要。

Method: 1) 在权重更新上拟合受限二次函数以保护极值；2) 将平均二次值与通道零更新次数相乘计算通道重要性；3) 对非微调模型采用伪微调策略。

Result: 在AIME-120、FOLIO等四个推理基准上，QuantLRM对监督微调、DPO和强化学习微调模型均实现稳定提升，其中强化学习微调模型平均提升6.55%。

Conclusion: 基于权重更新信号的QuantLRM方法有效验证了"保护两端"假设，优于激活或二阶信息方法，伪微调策略进一步扩展了其适用范围。

Abstract: Weight-only quantization is important for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by the spirit of classical magnitude pruning, we study whether the magnitude of weight updates during reasoning-incentivized fine-tuning can provide valuable signals for quantizing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We hypothesize that the smallest and largest weight updates during fine-tuning are more important than those of intermediate magnitude, a phenomenon we term "protecting both ends". Upon hypothesis validation, we introduce QuantLRM, which stands for weight quantization of LRMs via fine-tuning signals. We fit simple restricted quadratic functions on weight updates to protect both ends. By multiplying the average quadratic values with the count of zero weight updates of channels, we compute channel importance that is more effective than using activation or second-order information. We run QuantLRM to quantize various fine-tuned models (including supervised, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning) over four reasoning benchmarks (AIME-120, FOLIO, temporal sequences, and GPQA-Diamond) and empirically find that QuantLRM delivers a consistent improvement for LRMs quantization, with an average improvement of 6.55% on a reinforcement learning fine-tuned model. Also supporting non-fine-tuned LRMs, QuantLRM gathers effective signals via pseudo-fine-tuning, which greatly enhances its applicability.

TL;DR: 提出一种校准概率聚合框架，通过结合Copula依赖建模和上下文感知共形预测(CACP)，将站点级概率预测转化为可靠的 fleet-level 预测，解决可再生能源高渗透率下电网运行对聚合预测的需求与现有异构站点级预测之间的矛盾


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可再生能源渗透率快速增长对电网聚合层级（fleet/system）可靠概率预测提出迫切需求，但实际中系统运营商往往只能获取来自不同第三方的站点级异构预测，缺乏 fleet-level 模型，且存在跨站点依赖关系复杂和聚合诱导的校准偏差两大挑战

Method: 集成Copula-based依赖建模（捕捉跨站点相关性）与Context-Aware Conformal Prediction (CACP)（修正聚合层级的校准偏差），构建可直接将站点级预测转化为 fleet-level 预测的校准概率聚合框架

Result: 基于MISO/ERCOT/SPP大规模太阳能发电数据集的实验表明：Copula+CACP方法持续实现接近名义覆盖率的预测，且预测区间比未校准聚合基线显著更尖锐

Conclusion: 该框架在无需训练系统级模型的场景下，实现了依赖感知的聚合预测，同时提供有效覆盖率和尖锐的预测区间，为电网运营商利用现有站点级预测生成可靠的 fleet-level 概率预测提供了可行方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of renewable energy penetration has intensified the need for reliable probabilistic forecasts to support grid operations at aggregated (fleet or system) levels. In practice, however, system operators often lack access to fleet-level probabilistic models and instead rely on site-level forecasts produced by heterogeneous third-party providers. Constructing coherent and calibrated fleet-level probabilistic forecasts from such inputs remains challenging due to complex cross-site dependencies and aggregation-induced miscalibration. This paper proposes a calibrated probabilistic aggregation framework that directly converts site-level probabilistic forecasts into reliable fleet-level forecasts in settings where system-level models cannot be trained or maintained. The framework integrates copula-based dependence modeling to capture cross-site correlations with Context-Aware Conformal Prediction (CACP) to correct miscalibration at the aggregated level. This combination enables dependence-aware aggregation while providing valid coverage and maintaining sharp prediction intervals. Experiments on large-scale solar generation datasets from MISO, ERCOT, and SPP demonstrate that the proposed Copula+CACP approach consistently achieves near-nominal coverage with significantly sharper intervals than uncalibrated aggregation baselines.

Method: 将学习任务建模为对Zipf长尾分布的模式渐进覆盖过程，定义有效前沿(k_*)作为知识边界的阈值，证明可约损失由资源依赖的前沿截断尾部分布概率质量决定

Result: 推导出N/D/C的精确缩放律：分别对应容量瓶颈（模型规模）、覆盖瓶颈（数据规模）和优化瓶颈（计算量）；揭示Kaplan与Chinchilla定律是同一约束优化问题在不同活跃瓶颈下的平衡解

Conclusion: 通过Max-Bottleneck原则统一缩放机制，证明不同缩放律本质是同一优化框架下的特例，为神经缩放定律提供直观且普适的理论解释

Abstract: Neural scaling laws govern the prediction power-law improvement of test loss with respect to model capacity ($N$), datasize ($D$), and compute ($C$). However, existing theoretical explanations often rely on specific architectures or complex kernel methods, lacking intuitive universality. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that abstracts general learning tasks as the progressive coverage of patterns from a long-tail (Zipfian) distribution. We introduce the Effective Frontier ($k_\star$), a threshold in the pattern rank space that separates learned knowledge from the unlearned tail. We prove that reducible loss is asymptotically determined by the probability mass of the tail a resource-dependent frontier truncation. Based on our framework, we derive the precise scaling laws for $N$, $D$, and $C$, attributing them to capacity, coverage, and optimization bottlenecks, respectively. Furthermore, we unify these mechanisms via a Max-Bottleneck principle, demonstrating that the Kaplan and Chinchilla scaling laws are not contradictory, but equilibrium solutions to the same constrained optimization problem under different active bottlenecks.

Motivation: 现有高维表征漂移度量（欧氏/余弦距离）假设坐标固定，无法区分数据内在变化与由任意参数化引起的变异，导致变化被系统性高估。

Method: 引入基于Fubini-Study度量的射影几何框架，构建表征轨迹，并比较欧氏、余弦和Fubini-Study距离以分离规范不变的内禀演化。

Result: 证明传统度量在表征存在射影模糊性时系统性高估漂移；Fubini-Study度量在规范变换下保持不变；余弦与Fubini-Study漂移之差可量化规范自由度导致的" churn"。

Conclusion: 建立了评估表征稳定性的几何准则，可区分有意义的结构演化与参数化伪影，将数据分析与几何理论连接，并提供可直接验证的观测指标。

Abstract: High dimensional representation drift is commonly quantified using Euclidean or cosine distances, which presuppose fixed coordinates when comparing representations across time, training or preprocessing stages. While effective in many settings, these measures entangle intrinsic changes in the data with variations induced by arbitrary parametrizations. We introduce a projective geometric view of representation drift grounded in the Fubini Study metric, which identifies representations that differ only by gauge transformations such as global rescalings or sign flips. Applying this framework to empirical high dimensional datasets, we explicitly construct representation trajectories and track their evolution through cumulative geometric drift. Comparing Euclidean, cosine and Fubini Study distances along these trajectories reveals that conventional metrics systematically overestimate change whenever representations carry genuine projective ambiguity. By contrast, the Fubini Study metric isolates intrinsic evolution by remaining invariant under gauge-induced fluctuations. We further show that the difference between cosine and Fubini Study drift defines a computable, monotone quantity that directly captures representation churn attributable to gauge freedom. This separation provides a diagnostic for distinguishing meaningful structural evolution from parametrization artifacts, without introducing model-specific assumptions. Overall, we establish a geometric criterion for assessing representation stability in high-dimensional systems and clarify the limits of angular distances. Embedding representation dynamics in projective space connects data analysis with established geometric programs and yields observables that are directly testable in empirical workflows.

TL;DR: ContextEvolve是一种多智能体框架，通过三个专用智能体（Summarizer、Navigator、Sampler）在仅API访问条件下实现RL级别的搜索效率，在ADRS基准上超越SOTA方法33.3%并减少29%令牌消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型生成的系统代码需要迭代优化才能满足严格正确性和性能要求。测试时强化学习需要参数更新（仅API访问时不可行），而现有免训练进化方法存在上下文利用低效和搜索无方向的问题。

Method: 提出ContextEvolve框架，将优化上下文分解为三个正交维度：Summarizer智能体通过代码到语言抽象压缩语义状态，Navigator智能体从轨迹分析中提取优化方向，Sampler智能体通过优先级示例检索管理经验分布，形成与强化学习的功能同构。

Result: 在ADRS基准测试中，ContextEvolve超越现有最优基线33.3%，同时降低令牌消耗29.0%。

Conclusion: 该框架成功在文本潜在空间中实现了原则性优化，代码已开源（https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ContextEvolve-ACC），为仅API访问场景下的系统算法优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models are transforming systems research by automating the discovery of performance-critical algorithms for computer systems. Despite plausible codes generated by LLMs, producing solutions that meet the stringent correctness and performance requirements of systems demands iterative optimization. Test-time reinforcement learning offers high search efficiency but requires parameter updates infeasible under API-only access, while existing training-free evolutionary methods suffer from inefficient context utilization and undirected search. We introduce ContextEvolve, a multi-agent framework that achieves RL-level search efficiency under strict parameter-blind constraints by decomposing optimization context into three orthogonal dimensions: a Summarizer Agent condenses semantic state via code-to-language abstraction, a Navigator Agent distills optimization direction from trajectory analysis, and a Sampler Agent curates experience distribution through prioritized exemplar retrieval. This orchestration forms a functional isomorphism with RL-mapping to state representation, policy gradient, and experience replay-enabling principled optimization in a textual latent space. On the ADRS benchmark, ContextEvolve outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 33.3% while reducing token consumption by 29.0%.

TL;DR: RAP通过剪枝与RoPE旋转结构对齐的列对，在保持RoPE功能的同时实现低秩压缩，使KV-Cache、注意力参数和计算量减少20-30%，并降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE架构的现代大模型中，低秩分解压缩KV-Cache的方法失效，因为RoPE要求潜在KV状态必须重建到完整维度，重新引入显著的内存和计算开销，成为长上下文推理的瓶颈。

Method: 提出RoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP)，通过剪枝整个与RoPE对齐的列对来保持RoPE的2x2旋转结构，从而恢复低秩分解中B矩阵的权重吸收能力，消除重建需求。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B和Mistral-7B上评估显示，RAP能同时减少KV-Cache、注意力参数和FLOPs达20-30%，同时保持准确率；注意力延迟降至基线的83%（预填充）和77%（解码）。

Conclusion: RAP通过尊重RoPE的旋转结构，成功实现了对RoPE基大模型的有效低秩压缩，在保持精度的同时提供显著的效率提升，使长上下文推理更加实用。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory and compute cost of the KV-Cache. Low-rank factorization compresses KV projections by writing $W \approx A * B$, where A produces latent KV states and B can be absorbed into downstream weights. In modern RoPE-based LLMs, this absorption fails: RoPE forces latent KV states to be reconstructed to full dimension, reintroducing substantial memory and compute overhead. We propose RoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP), which prunes entire RoPE-aligned column pairs to preserve RoPE's 2x2 rotation structure, restore B absorption, and eliminate reconstruction. Our evaluation on LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B shows that RAP enables joint reduction of KV-Cache, attention parameters, and FLOPs by 20-30%, all at once, while maintaining strong accuracy. Notably, RAP reduces attention latency to 83% (prefill) and 77% (decode) of baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how sampling strategies affect safety behaviors in diffusion language models (DLMs) compared to autoregressive (AR) models, and introduces a new framework called Step-Wise Refusal Internal Dynamics (SRI) for detecting harmful content generation with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diffusion language models show promise with parallel decoding and controllable sampling, the role of sampling mechanisms in shaping refusal behavior and jailbreak robustness is poorly understood. The safety implications of different sampling strategies need deeper investigation.

Method: The authors developed an analytical framework for step-wise refusal dynamics to compare AR and diffusion sampling strategies. They introduced the Step-Wise Refusal Internal Dynamics (SRI) signal to capture internal recovery patterns during generation.

Result: The SRI framework reveals that sampling strategy significantly impacts safety behavior independently from learned representations. It enables lightweight inference-time detectors that generalize to unseen attacks while matching or outperforming existing defenses with over 100x lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: The geometric structure of SRI captures internal recovery dynamics and identifies harmful generations as cases of incomplete internal recovery. This approach provides both interpretability and improved safety for both AR and diffusion language models with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) models, offering parallel decoding and controllable sampling dynamics while achieving competitive generation quality at scale. Despite this progress, the role of sampling mechanisms in shaping refusal behavior and jailbreak robustness remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a fundamental analytical framework for step-wise refusal dynamics, enabling comparison between AR and diffusion sampling. Our analysis reveals that the sampling strategy itself plays a central role in safety behavior, as a factor distinct from the underlying learned representations. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce the Step-Wise Refusal Internal Dynamics (SRI) signal, which supports interpretability and improved safety for both AR and DLMs. We demonstrate that the geometric structure of SRI captures internal recovery dynamics, and identifies anomalous behavior in harmful generations as cases of \emph{incomplete internal recovery} that are not observable at the text level. This structure enables lightweight inference-time detectors that generalize to unseen attacks while matching or outperforming existing defenses with over $100\times$ lower inference overhead.

Conclusion: 该方法成功构建了无监督的全局参考系，突破了等距方法的局限性，兼具理论保证和实践有效性，为流形学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: We introduce an unsupervised approach for constructing a global reference system by learning, in the ambient space, vector fields that span the tangent spaces of an unknown data manifold. In contrast to isometric objectives, which implicitly assume manifold flatness, our method learns tangent vector fields whose flows transport all samples to a common, learnable reference point. The resulting arc-lengths along these flows define interpretable intrinsic coordinates tied to a shared global frame. To prevent degenerate collapse, we enforce a non-shrinking constraint and derive a scalable, integration-free objective inspired by flow matching. Within our theoretical framework, we prove that minimizing the proposed objective recovers a global coordinate chart when one exists. Empirically, we obtain correct tangent alignment and coherent global coordinate structure on synthetic manifolds. We also demonstrate the scalability of our method on CIFAR-10, where the learned coordinates achieve competitive downstream classification performance.

Conclusion: HDR-based包含分数为生态运动时序数据在有限标注和严重类别不平衡条件下提供了可量化的新类别发现实用方案

Abstract: Learning behavioral taxonomies from animal-borne sensors is challenging because labels are scarce, classes are highly imbalanced, and behaviors may be absent from the annotated set. We study generalized behavior discovery in short multivariate motion snippets from gulls, where each sample is a sequence with 3-axis IMU acceleration (20 Hz) and GPS speed, spanning nine expert-annotated behavior categories. We propose a semi-supervised discovery pipeline that (i) learns an embedding function from the labeled subset, (ii) performs label-guided clustering over embeddings of both labeled and unlabeled samples to form candidate behavior groups, and (iii) decides whether a discovered group is truly novel using a containment score. Our key contribution is a KDE + HDR (highest-density region) containment score that measures how much a discovered cluster distribution is contained within, or contains, each known-class distribution; the best-match containment score serves as an interpretable novelty statistic. In experiments where an entire behavior is withheld from supervision and appears only in the unlabeled pool, the method recovers a distinct cluster and the containment score flags novelty via low overlap, while a negative-control setting with no novel behavior yields consistently higher overlaps. These results suggest that HDR-based containment provides a practical, quantitative test for generalized class discovery in ecological motion time series under limited annotation and severe class imbalance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在短期任务上表现出色，但扩展到长周期智能体工作流仍面临挑战。核心瓶颈在于缺乏能捕捉真实长距离依赖结构和跨阶段演化动态的训练数据。现有合成方法要么局限于模型分布约束下的单特征场景，要么需要昂贵的人工标注成本，无法提供可扩展、高质量的监督信号。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at short-term tasks, scaling them to long-horizon agentic workflows remains challenging. The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics--existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency, which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling. The resulting trajectories are substantial--averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls--yet remarkably data-efficient: fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on 239 daVinci-Agency samples yields broad improvements across benchmarks, notably achieving a 47% relative gain on Toolathlon. Beyond benchmark performance, our analysis confirms...

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI through causal AI and structural causal models, building on recent advances in network sheaves and cosheaves of causal knowledge.

Method: The authors propose a causal abstraction network (CAN) framework where SCMs are Gaussian, restriction maps are transposes of linear causal abstractions, and edge stalks correspond to node stalks of detailed SCMs. They formulate the problem as edge-specific local Riemannian problems avoiding nonconvex objectives, and solve them with SPECTRAL, an iterative method with closed-form updates for covariance matrices.

Result: Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate competitive performance in causal abstraction learning and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Conclusion: The sheaf-theoretic approach with the SPECTRAL algorithm provides an efficient and effective method for learning consistent causal abstractions, advancing the field of causal AI.

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models (SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves and cosheaves of causal knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we tackle the learning of consistent causal abstraction network (CAN), a sheaf-theoretic framework where (i) SCMs are Gaussian, (ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions (CAs) adhering to the semantic embedding principle, and (iii) edge stalks correspond--up to permutation--to the node stalks of more detailed SCMs. Our problem formulation separates into edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure, solving the local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices. Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretraining large language models requires massive computing resources; for limited datasets, smaller LLMs are preferable per scaling laws. Academic users need efficient pretraining methods on commodity GPU testbeds.

Method: The study tested data parallelism, intra-operator parallelism, and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism (and combinations) on homogeneous/heterogeneous GPU clusters. They evaluated GPT-2 medium/large models using Alpa and Ray, focusing on network latency effects with geographically distributed GPUs.

Result: Alpa's execution plans that jointly optimized intra-operator and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism consistently delivered the best performance for geographically distributed GPUs, particularly with network latencies in the 10's of milliseconds.

Conclusion: Based on experimental insights, the authors propose a systematic approach for selecting pretraining techniques to maximize training performance/minimize execution time while reducing GPU requirements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require enormous computing power to pretrain on massive datasets. When limited datasets are available, smaller-sized LLMs are better choice to pretrain (on user-specified datasets) by following the scaling laws of LLMs. Using pretrained models, vector embeddings can be generated for raw data and stored using vector databases to support modern AI applications and semantic search. In this work, we investigate the performance of pretraining techniques for smaller-sized LLMs on an experimental testbed (with commodity GPUs) available to academic users at no charge. We consider data parallelism, intra-operator parallelism, and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism, and their combinations for pretraining. We set up different GPU clusters with homogeneous and heterogeneous GPU hardware. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of network latency on pretraining performance especially when GPUs are geographically distributed. We used GPT-2 medium and large models and pretrained them using open-source packages, namely, Alpa and Ray. We observed that Alpa's execution plans that collectively optimized intra-operator and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism consistently performed the best when GPUs were geographically distributed. This was especially true when the network latencies were in 10's of milliseconds. Based on the insights gained from the experiments, we propose a systematic approach for selecting the appropriate pretraining technique to achieve high training performance/lower execution time as well as to reduce the number of GPUs used.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于约减的框架来处理带延迟反馈的在线学习，通过将遗憾分解为独立于延迟的学习项和延迟引起的漂移项，为凸优化问题提供了更优的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有带延迟反馈的在线学习研究在凸优化问题上存在局限，需要开发更通用且性能更优的框架来处理一阶和强盗凸优化问题。

Method: 引入连续时间模型，将遗憾分解为延迟无关的学习项和延迟引起的漂移项，设计延迟自适应约减方法，将任意在线线性优化算法转换为能处理轮次依赖延迟的算法。

Result: 强盗凸优化遗憾界提升至O(√(d_tot) + T^(3/4)√k)，延迟相关项从O(min{√(T d_max), (T d_tot)^(1/3)})改进为O(√(d_tot))；强凸情形下延迟相关项从O(d_max ln T)改进为O(min{σ_max ln T, √(d_tot)})。

Conclusion: 该框架统一分析了一阶和强盗反馈场景，显著改进了延迟相关遗憾界，且分析更为简洁，为延迟反馈在线学习提供了更优的理论保证。

Abstract: We develop a reduction-based framework for online learning with delayed feedback that recovers and improves upon existing results for both first-order and bandit convex optimization. Our approach introduces a continuous-time model under which regret decomposes into a delay-independent learning term and a delay-induced drift term, yielding a delay-adaptive reduction that converts any algorithm for online linear optimization into one that handles round-dependent delays. For bandit convex optimization, we significantly improve existing regret bounds, with delay-dependent terms matching state-of-the-art first-order rates. For first-order feedback, we recover state-of-the-art regret bounds via a simpler, unified analysis. Quantitatively, for bandit convex optimization we obtain $O(\sqrt{d_{\text{tot}}} + T^{\frac{3}{4}}\sqrt{k})$ regret, improving the delay-dependent term from $O(\min\{\sqrt{T d_{\text{max}}},(Td_{\text{tot}})^{\frac{1}{3}}\})$ in previous work to $O(\sqrt{d_{\text{tot}}})$. Here, $k$, $T$, $d_{\text{max}}$, and $d_{\text{tot}}$ denote the dimension, time horizon, maximum delay, and total delay, respectively. Under strong convexity, we achieve $O(\min\{σ_{\text{max}} \ln T, \sqrt{d_{\text{tot}}}\} + (T^2\ln T)^{\frac{1}{3}} {k}^{\frac{2}{3}})$, improving the delay-dependent term from $O(d_{\text{max}} \ln T)$ in previous work to $O(\min\{σ_{\text{max}} \ln T, \sqrt{d_{\text{tot}}}\})$, where $σ_{\text{max}}$ denotes the maximum number of outstanding observations and may be considerably smaller than $d_{\text{max}}$.

Motivation: Xenium等平台产生的高分辨率空间转录组数据维度极高，现有表征学习和聚类方法面临重大挑战

Conclusion: 空间正则化NMF方法能有效提升聚类空间连续性和生物一致性，为空间组学分析提供新工具

Abstract: High-resolution spatial transcriptomics platforms, such as Xenium, generate single-cell images that capture both molecular and spatial context, but their extremely high dimensionality poses major challenges for representation learning and clustering. In this study, we analyze data from the Xenium platform, which captures high-resolution images of tumor microarray (TMA) tissues and converts them into cell-by-gene matrices suitable for computational analysis. We benchmark and extend nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for spatial transcriptomics by introducing two spatially regularized variants. First, we propose Spatial NMF (SNMF), a lightweight baseline that enforces local spatial smoothness by diffusing each cell's NMF factor vector over its spatial neighborhood. Second, we introduce Hybrid Spatial NMF (hSNMF), which performs spatially regularized NMF followed by Leiden clustering on a hybrid adjacency that integrates spatial proximity (via a contact-radius graph) and transcriptomic similarity through a tunable mixing parameter alpha. Evaluated on a cholangiocarcinoma dataset, SNMF and hSNMF achieve markedly improved spatial compactness (CHAOS < 0.004, Moran's I > 0.96), greater cluster separability (Silhouette > 0.12, DBI < 1.8), and higher biological coherence (CMC and enrichment) compared to other spatial baselines.

Conclusion: 连续球面注意力是一种有效的通用几何算子，能显著提升原子模型的表达性、稳定性和可靠性

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have become essential for accurate and efficient atomistic modeling. Despite their high accuracy, most existing approaches rely on fixed angular expansions, limiting flexibility in weighting local geometric interactions. We introduce Modular Angular-Radial Attention (MARA), a module that extends spherical attention -- originally developed for SO(3) tasks -- to the molecular domain and SE(3), providing an efficient approximation of equivariant interactions. MARA operates directly on the angular and radial coordinates of neighboring atoms, enabling flexible, geometrically informed, and modular weighting of local environments. Unlike existing attention mechanisms in SE(3)-equivariant architectures, MARA can be integrated in a plug-and-play manner into models such as MACE without architectural modifications. Across molecular benchmarks, MARA improves energy and force predictions, reduces high-error events, and enhances robustness. These results demonstrate that continuous spherical attention is an effective and generalizable geometric operator that increases the expressiveness, stability, and reliability of atomistic models.

TL;DR: FlexRank extracts nested, importance-ordered submodels from pretrained large neural networks via low-rank decomposition, enabling adaptive deployment across computational budgets without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large models (LLMs/ViTs) are expensive training/deployment monoliths with fixed costs, failing to leverage overparametrization for budget-adaptive deployment.

Method: Low-rank weight decomposition with nested, importance-based consolidation to extract progressively capable submodels.

Result: Achieves "train-once, deploy-everywhere" paradigm with graceful cost-performance trade-offs across different computational budgets.

Conclusion: Enables practical deployment of large models by dynamically activating nested components based on available resources, avoiding per-budget retraining.

Abstract: The growing scale of deep neural networks, encompassing large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs), has made training from scratch prohibitively expensive and deployment increasingly costly. These models are often used as computational monoliths with fixed cost, a rigidity that does not leverage overparametrized architectures and largely hinders adaptive deployment across different cost budgets. We argue that importance-ordered nested components can be extracted from pretrained models, and selectively activated on the available computational budget. To this end, our proposed FlexRank method leverages low-rank weight decomposition with nested, importance-based consolidation to extract submodels of increasing capabilities. Our approach enables a "train-once, deploy-everywhere" paradigm that offers a graceful trade-off between cost and performance without training from scratch for each budget - advancing practical deployment of large models.

TL;DR: 在去中心化扩散模型中，生成质量不由采样稳定性决定，而取决于将输入路由到训练数据覆盖当前去噪状态的专家


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化扩散模型（DDMs）中多个独立专家对预测存在分歧，但生成质量的关键影响因素尚未被系统研究

Method: 通过两种DDM系统进行实验：分析不同路由策略（全集成/稀疏Top-2）下的去噪轨迹敏感性，并验证专家-数据对齐（数据簇距离分析、专家预测准确性、专家分歧分析）

Result: 全集成路由稳定性最高但生成质量最差（FID 47.9 vs Top-2路由的22.6），而稀疏路由因优先选择数据簇最接近当前去噪状态的专家，显著提升生成质量

Conclusion: DDMs部署时应放弃稳定性指标，优先设计基于专家-数据对齐的路由策略

Abstract: Decentralized Diffusion Models (DDMs) route denoising through experts trained independently on disjoint data clusters, which can strongly disagree in their predictions. What governs the quality of generations in such systems? We present the first ever systematic investigation of this question. A priori, the expectation is that minimizing denoising trajectory sensitivity -- minimizing how perturbations amplify during sampling -- should govern generation quality. We demonstrate this hypothesis is incorrect: a stability-quality dissociation. Full ensemble routing, which combines all expert predictions at each step, achieves the most stable sampling dynamics and best numerical convergence while producing the worst generation quality (FID 47.9 vs. 22.6 for sparse Top-2 routing). Instead, we identify expert-data alignment as the governing principle: generation quality depends on routing inputs to experts whose training distribution covers the current denoising state. Across two distinct DDM systems, we validate expert-data alignment using (i) data-cluster distance analysis, confirming sparse routing selects experts with data clusters closest to the current denoising state, and (ii) per-expert analysis, showing selected experts produce more accurate predictions than non-selected ones, and (iii) expert disagreement analysis, showing quality degrades when experts disagree. For DDM deployment, our findings establish that routing should prioritize expert-data alignment over numerical stability metrics.

Result: 获得竞争性FID分数，避免小数据集训练不稳定，减少记忆化，促进关键上下文信息利用。

Conclusion: 该掩码策略简单有效，显著改善扩散模型空间一致性，提升训练稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across a wide range of generative tasks. However, they often suffer from spatially inconsistent generation, arguably due to the inherent locality of their denoising mechanisms. This can yield samples that are locally plausible but globally inconsistent. To mitigate this issue, we propose sparsely supervised learning for diffusion models, a simple yet effective masking strategy that can be implemented with only a few lines of code. Interestingly, the experiments show that it is safe to mask up to 98\% of pixels during diffusion model training. Our method delivers competitive FID scores across experiments and, most importantly, avoids training instability on small datasets. Moreover, the masking strategy reduces memorization and promotes the use of essential contextual information during generation.

### [166] [Every Bit Counts: A Theoretical Study of Precision-Expressivity Tradeoffs in Quantized Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02707)
*Sayak Chakrabarti,Toniann Pitassi,Josh Alman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a fine-grained theoretical tradeoff between quantization precision and Transformer expressivity, proving that even a single-bit reduction in precision can cause a sharp threshold where certain functions (like equality comparisons) become impossible to compute, explaining empirical expressivity loss and guiding quantization choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization accelerates Transformer inference but its impact on expressivity is poorly understood; this work aims to characterize the precise tradeoff between numerical precision and the model's ability to represent functions, especially equality-like operations crucial for many tasks.

Method: Combines explicit constructions of finite-precision one-layer softmax Transformers with communication-complexity lower bounds to prove tight "one-bit" thresholds for specific functions (Γ, inspired by equality).

Result: For every precision level p, there exists a function Γ that a one-layer Transformer can compute with p bits but not with p-1 bits, demonstrating a concrete, sharp threshold where expressivity is lost due to quantization.

Conclusion: Quantization-induced expressivity loss is particularly severe for equality-like tasks (exact match, membership); practitioners must select precision based on the required equality-check length, paving the way for task-specific quantization heuristics.

Abstract: Quantization reduces the numerical precision of Transformer computations and is widely used to accelerate inference, yet its effect on expressivity remains poorly characterized. We demonstrate a fine-grained theoretical tradeoff between expressivity and precision: For every p we exhibit a function Γ, inspired by the equality function, and prove that a one-layer softmax Transformer can compute Γ, with p bits of precision, but not with p-1 bits of precision.
  This result concretely explains the widely observed phenomenon of empirical loss of expressivity when quantization is used. Practically, it suggests that tasks requiring equality-like comparisons (exact match, membership, etc.) are especially sensitive to quantization. Dropping even one bit can cross a threshold where the model cannot represent the needed comparison reliably. Thus, it paves the way for developing heuristics that will help practitioners choose how much quantization is possible: the precision should be chosen as a function of the length of equality to be checked for the specific task.
  Our proofs combine explicit finite-precision Transformer constructions with communication-complexity lower bounds, yielding a tight "one-bit" threshold.

Conclusion: 基于置信度的奖励设计为二元分类提供了比监督微调更鲁棒的替代方案，展示了离线强化学习在静态数据集上学习有效决策策略的潜力

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for binary classification tasks such as toxicity detection, factuality verification, and causal inference. However, SFT often performs poorly in real-world settings with label noise, class imbalance, or sparse supervision. We introduce BinaryPPO, an offline reinforcement learning large language model (LLM) framework that reformulates binary classification as a reward maximization problem. Our method leverages a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a confidence-weighted reward function that penalizes uncertain or incorrect predictions, enabling the model to learn robust decision policies from static datasets without online interaction. Across eight domain-specific benchmarks and multiple models with differing architectures, BinaryPPO improves accuracy by 40-60 percentage points, reaching up to 99%, substantially outperforming supervised baselines. We provide an in-depth analysis of the role of reward shaping, advantage scaling, and policy stability in enabling this improvement. Overall, we demonstrate that confidence-based reward design provides a robust alternative to SFT for binary classification. Our code is available at https://github.com/psyonp/BinaryPPO.

TL;DR: MaxRL is a new reinforcement learning framework that better approximates maximum likelihood optimization for sampling-based tasks with binary feedback, outperforming existing methods by up to 20x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods only optimize a lower-order approximation of the likelihood over correct rollouts in sampling-based setups, rather than maximizing the true likelihood, which limits their efficiency and scaling potential.

Method: The authors introduce Maximum Likelihood Reinforcement Learning (MaxRL), which defines a compute-indexed family of sample-based objectives that interpolate between standard RL and exact maximum likelihood as compute increases, using an unbiased policy-gradient estimator that converges to maximum likelihood in the infinite-compute limit.

Result: MaxRL Pareto-dominates existing methods across all tested models and tasks, achieving up to 20x test-time scaling efficiency gains compared to GRPO, and demonstrates superior scaling with additional data and compute resources.

Conclusion: MaxRL provides a promising framework for scaling reinforcement learning training in correctness-based settings by more faithfully approximating maximum likelihood optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is the method of choice to train models in sampling-based setups with binary outcome feedback, such as navigation, code generation, and mathematical problem solving. In such settings, models implicitly induce a likelihood over correct rollouts. However, we observe that reinforcement learning does not maximize this likelihood, and instead optimizes only a lower-order approximation. Inspired by this observation, we introduce Maximum Likelihood Reinforcement Learning (MaxRL), a sampling-based framework to approximate maximum likelihood using reinforcement learning techniques. MaxRL addresses the challenges of non-differentiable sampling by defining a compute-indexed family of sample-based objectives that interpolate between standard reinforcement learning and exact maximum likelihood as additional sampling compute is allocated. The resulting objectives admit a simple, unbiased policy-gradient estimator and converge to maximum likelihood optimization in the infinite-compute limit. Empirically, we show that MaxRL Pareto-dominates existing methods in all models and tasks we tested, achieving up to 20x test-time scaling efficiency gains compared to its GRPO-trained counterpart. We also observe MaxRL to scale better with additional data and compute. Our results suggest MaxRL is a promising framework for scaling RL training in correctness based settings.

TL;DR: This paper provides the first theoretical analysis of steering strength in LLM representation control, revealing non-monotonic effects and deriving qualitative laws that are validated across eleven models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While direction selection for steering LLM latent representations is well-studied, the critical problem of choosing appropriate magnitude (steering strength) lacks theoretical understanding—too little fails to elicit desired behavior while too much causes severe performance degradation.

Method: Theoretical analysis characterizing steering strength's effect on next token probability, concept presence, and cross-entropy, deriving precise qualitative laws, with empirical validation on eleven language models from small GPT to modern architectures.

Result: The analysis reveals surprising non-monotonic effects of steering strength, and the derived theoretical predictions are validated across all eleven tested language models.

Conclusion: The work establishes foundational theoretical understanding of steering strength in LLM control, providing governing qualitative laws that explain its complex effects and demonstrating their broad applicability across model sizes.

Abstract: A popular approach to post-training control of large language models (LLMs) is the steering of intermediate latent representations. Namely, identify a well-chosen direction depending on the task at hand and perturbs representations along this direction at inference time. While many propositions exist to pick this direction, considerably less is understood about how to choose the magnitude of the move, whereas its importance is clear: too little and the intended behavior does not emerge, too much and the model's performance degrades beyond repair. In this work, we propose the first theoretical analysis of steering strength. We characterize its effect on next token probability, presence of a concept, and cross-entropy, deriving precise qualitative laws governing these quantities. Our analysis reveals surprising behaviors, including non-monotonic effects of steering strength. We validate our theoretical predictions empirically on eleven language models, ranging from a small GPT architecture to modern models.

Abstract: We propose a hierarchical entity-centric framework for offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) that combines subgoal decomposition with factored structure to solve long-horizon tasks in domains with multiple entities. Achieving long-horizon goals in complex environments remains a core challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Domains with multiple entities are particularly difficult due to their combinatorial complexity. GCRL facilitates generalization across goals and the use of subgoal structure, but struggles with high-dimensional observations and combinatorial state-spaces, especially under sparse reward. We employ a two-level hierarchy composed of a value-based GCRL agent and a factored subgoal-generating conditional diffusion model. The RL agent and subgoal generator are trained independently and composed post hoc through selective subgoal generation based on the value function, making the approach modular and compatible with existing GCRL algorithms. We introduce new variations to benchmark tasks that highlight the challenges of multi-entity domains, and show that our method consistently boosts performance of the underlying RL agent on image-based long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, achieving over 150% higher success rates on the hardest task in our suite and generalizing to increasing horizons and numbers of entities.

Abstract: Deep Learning models encode rich semantic information in their hidden representations. However, it remains challenging to understand which parts of this information models actually rely on when making predictions. A promising line of post-hoc concept-based explanation methods relies on clustering token representations.

We perform thorough evaluations and show that VQLC improves scalability while maintaining comparable quality of human-understandable explanations.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models generate sequences by iteratively denoising samples corrupted by categorical noise, offering an appealing alternative to autoregressive decoding for structured and symbolic generation. However, standard training targets a likelihood-based objective that primarily matches the data distribution and provides no native mechanism for enforcing hard constraints or optimizing non-differentiable properties at inference time. This work addresses this limitation and introduces Search-Augmented Masked Diffusion (SearchDiff), a training-free neurosymbolic inference framework that integrates informed search directly into the reverse denoising process. At each denoising step, the model predictions define a proposal set that is optimized under a user-specified property satisfaction, yielding a modified reverse transition that steers sampling toward probable and feasible solutions. Experiments in biological design and symbolic reasoning illustrate that SearchDiff substantially improves constraint satisfaction and property adherence, while consistently outperforming discrete diffusion and autoregressive baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard softmax attention entangles global trends, local shocks, and seasonal patterns through global normalization, while recent recurrent models sacrifice long-term, order-independent selection for causal structure.

Method: CAPS combines SO(2) rotations for phase alignment with three additive gating paths (Riemann softmax, prefix-product gates, and a Clock baseline) within a single attention layer, modulated by a learned Clock mechanism for temporal weighting.

Result: Experiments show CAPS surpasses vanilla softmax and linear attention mechanisms and demonstrates competitive performance against seven strong baselines while maintaining linear complexity.

Conclusion: CAPS provides an effective structured attention mechanism for time series forecasting that successfully decouples temporal patterns without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents $\textbf{CAPS}$ (Clock-weighted Aggregation with Prefix-products and Softmax), a structured attention mechanism for time series forecasting that decouples three distinct temporal structures: global trends, local shocks, and seasonal patterns. Standard softmax attention entangles these through global normalization, while recent recurrent models sacrifice long-term, order-independent selection for order-dependent causal structure. CAPS combines SO(2) rotations for phase alignment with three additive gating paths -- Riemann softmax, prefix-product gates, and a Clock baseline -- within a single attention layer. We introduce the Clock mechanism, a learned temporal weighting that modulates these paths through a shared notion of temporal importance. Experiments on long- and short-term forecasting benchmarks surpass vanilla softmax and linear attention mechanisms and demonstrate competitive performance against seven strong baselines with linear complexity.

TL;DR: Proposes a zero-shot TabPFN-based framework for parametric engineering design that generates designs without training, using limited reference samples, achieving <2% performance error while drastically reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep generative models for engineering design suffer from high computational costs, large data requirements, and need extensive retraining when designs change, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: A zero-shot generation framework based on TabPFN that sequentially generates design parameters conditioned on target performance indicators, requiring only limited reference samples and no task-specific training or fine-tuning.

Result: Evaluated on ship hull, aircraft, and airfoil datasets; achieves competitive diversity, robustness to variations, <2% performance error, and significantly reduces computational overhead and data requirements compared to diffusion models while maintaining reliable performance.

Conclusion: Zero-shot, data-efficient generation shows strong potential as a practical tool for engineering design, enabling rapid deployment, flexible adaptation to new settings, and easy integration into real-world workflows.

Abstract: Deep generative models for engineering design often require substantial computational cost, large training datasets, and extensive retraining when design requirements or datasets change, limiting their applicability in real-world engineering design workflow. In this work, we propose a zero-shot generation framework for parametric engineering design based on TabPFN, enabling conditional design generation using only a limited number of reference samples and without any task-specific model training or fine-tuning. The proposed method generates design parameters sequentially conditioned on target performance indicators, providing a flexible alternative to conventional generative models. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on three engineering design datasets, i.e., ship hull design, BlendedNet aircraft, and UIUC airfoil. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive diversity across highly structured parametric design spaces, remains robust to variations in sampling, resolution and parameter dimensionality of geometry generation, and achieves a low performance error (e.g., less than 2% in generated ship hull designs' performance). Compared with diffusion-based generative models, the proposed framework significantly reduces computational overhead and data requirements while preserving reliable generation performance. These results highlight the potential of zero-shot, data-efficient generation as a practical and efficient tool for engineering design, enabling rapid deployment, flexible adaptation to new design settings, and ease of integration into real-world engineering workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了逆动力学模型（IDM）为何能提升半监督模仿学习性能，证明VM-IDM与IDM标注在极限情况下等价（称为IDM基策略），指出IDM的样本效率优势源于假设空间复杂度更低且随机性更小，并基于此提出了改进的LAPO算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IDM基的半监督模仿学习方法虽优于行为克隆，但其理论优势原因尚不明确。本文旨在从统计学习理论角度解释IDM基策略为何更高效，为算法改进提供理论依据。

Method: 首先理论证明VM-IDM与IDM标注在极限情况下学习相同策略；其次从统计学习理论出发，提出IDM样本效率更高的两个原因：真实IDM假设空间复杂度更低且随机性更小；最后通过UVA架构实验验证，并据此改进LAPO算法。

Result: 1) VM-IDM与IDM标注收敛于同一IDM基策略；2) IDM学习更高效因其假设类复杂度更低且随机性更小；3) 基于上述洞见提出了改进版LAPO算法。

Conclusion: IDM基策略的样本效率优势源于其结构特性，该理论认识指导了更优算法设计，改进的LAPO算法验证了理论分析的有效性。

Abstract: Semi-supervised imitation learning (SSIL) consists in learning a policy from a small dataset of action-labeled trajectories and a much larger dataset of action-free trajectories. Some SSIL methods learn an inverse dynamics model (IDM) to predict the action from the current state and the next state. An IDM can act as a policy when paired with a video model (VM-IDM) or as a label generator to perform behavior cloning on action-free data (IDM labeling). In this work, we first show that VM-IDM and IDM labeling learn the same policy in a limit case, which we call the IDM-based policy. We then argue that the previously observed advantage of IDM-based policies over behavior cloning is due to the superior sample efficiency of IDM learning, which we attribute to two causes: (i) the ground-truth IDM tends to be contained in a lower complexity hypothesis class relative to the expert policy, and (ii) the ground-truth IDM is often less stochastic than the expert policy. We argue these claims based on insights from statistical learning theory and novel experiments, including a study of IDM-based policies using recent architectures for unified video-action prediction (UVA). Motivated by these insights, we finally propose an improved version of the existing LAPO algorithm for latent action policy learning.

TL;DR: 针对纵向数据（如电子健康记录）的时序依赖问题，提出PATH框架，通过将整表作为合成单元并微调大语言模型，显著提升时序一致性，相比传统方法分布距离降低60%、状态转移错误减少50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私合成数据研究聚焦于独立同分布行数据，忽略纵向数据集（如电子健康记录）中用户贡献的时序事件复杂性；传统"展平"策略无法保持时序连贯性，即使保留边缘分布。

Method: 提出PATH生成框架：1) 将完整表格作为合成单元；2) 利用私有微调的大语言模型自回归能力建模长程依赖。

Result: 1) 捕获传统方法缺失的长程依赖；2) 分布距离比最优边缘机制降低>60%；3) 状态转移误差减少近50%；4) 保持相近边缘保真度。

Conclusion: PATH通过整表建模和LLM时序生成能力，有效解决纵向数据合成中的时序连贯性问题，为电子健康记录等场景提供高保真隐私保护方案。

Abstract: Research on differentially private synthetic tabular data has largely focused on independent and identically distributed rows where each record corresponds to a unique individual. This perspective neglects the temporal complexity in longitudinal datasets, such as electronic health records, where a user contributes an entire (sub) table of sequential events. While practitioners might attempt to model such data by flattening user histories into high-dimensional vectors for use with standard marginal-based mechanisms, we demonstrate that this strategy is insufficient. Flattening fails to preserve temporal coherence even when it maintains valid marginal distributions. We introduce PATH, a novel generative framework that treats the full table as the unit of synthesis and leverages the autoregressive capabilities of privately fine-tuned large language models. Extensive evaluations show that PATH effectively captures long-range dependencies that traditional methods miss. Empirically, our method reduces the distributional distance to real trajectories by over 60% and reduces state transition errors by nearly 50% compared to leading marginal mechanisms while achieving similar marginal fidelity.

*Meng Ding,Jinhui Xu,Kaiyi Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究从特征学习角度对持续学习中的全数据回放进行了理论分析，发现信噪比(SNR)是影响遗忘的关键因素。即使在全回放条件下，当后续任务的累积噪声主导早期任务信号时仍会发生遗忘，但足够的信号积累可恢复早期任务，且优先学习高信号任务能有效防止灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据回放是缓解持续学习中灾难性遗忘的有效方法，但全数据回放（可访问所有历史数据）的理论有效性尚未得到充分探索，其背后的遗忘机制仍不清楚。

Method: 采用多视角数据模型，从特征学习视角构建全数据回放训练的理论框架，针对M个任务的任务增量二分类场景，分析信噪比对遗忘的影响机制。

Result: 理论分析得出两个关键结论：(1)当后期任务累积噪声超过早期任务信号时，全回放仍会发生遗忘；(2)充足信号积累可使数据回放恢复早期任务，即使初始学习效果差。创新性地发现任务排序的重要性：优先学习高信号任务不仅有助于低信号任务学习，还能防止灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了信噪比决定全回放场景下的遗忘动态，表明仅凭全数据访问无法消除灾难性遗忘；基于信号强度的策略性任务排序是提升持续学习性能的新途径。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to train models on a sequence of tasks while retaining performance on previously learned ones. A core challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where new learning interferes with past knowledge. Among various mitigation strategies, data-replay methods, where past samples are periodically revisited, are considered simple yet effective, especially when memory constraints are relaxed. However, the theoretical effectiveness of full data replay, where all past data is accessible during training, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing full data-replay training in continual learning from a feature learning perspective. Adopting a multi-view data model, we identify the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a critical factor affecting forgetting. Focusing on task-incremental binary classification across $M$ tasks, our analysis verifies two key conclusions: (1) forgetting can still occur under full replay when the cumulative noise from later tasks dominates the signal from earlier ones; and (2) with sufficient signal accumulation, data replay can recover earlier tasks-even if their initial learning was poor. Notably, we uncover a novel insight into task ordering: prioritizing higher-signal tasks not only facilitates learning of lower-signal tasks but also helps prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our theoretical findings through synthetic and real-world experiments that visualize the interplay between signal learning and noise memorization across varying SNRs and task correlation regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出CTAF（跨时序注意力融合），一种自监督模块，用于处理EEG与外周生理信号在情感建模中的时序异步问题，在K-EmoCon数据集上实现了少标签下的高性能融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态情感建模方法大多忽略EEG与外周生理信号的时序异步性，或依赖昂贵的时序扭曲技术。这促使作者开发一种能直接建模模态间对应关系、并反映中枢与自主神经系统耦合的高效融合方法。

Method: 提出Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF)：自监督模块，学习模态间的软双向对齐；采用时序感知的交叉注意力机制；轻量级融合门控；对齐正则化的对比学习目标，支持可选的弱监督。

Result: 在K-EmoCon数据集上的留一法交叉验证显示：匹配对的余弦间隔更高；1秒内跨模态标记检索性能更好；在三分类准确率和宏观F1上达到基线水平；仅需少量标注（标签高效）。

Conclusion: CTAF是迈向标签高效、可泛化的时序异步EEG-外周生理信号融合的重要一步，有效建模了心理生理时间序列中中枢与自主神经系统的耦合关系。

Abstract: We study multimodal affect modeling when EEG and peripheral physiology are asynchronous, which most fusion methods ignore or handle with costly warping. We propose Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF), a self-supervised module that learns soft bidirectional alignments between modalities and builds a robust clip embedding using time-aware cross attention, a lightweight fusion gate, and alignment-regularized contrastive objectives with optional weak supervision. On the K-EmoCon dataset, under leave-one-out cross-validation evaluation, CTAF yields higher cosine margins for matched pairs and better cross-modal token retrieval within one second, and it is competitive with the baseline on three-bin accuracy and macro-F1 while using few labels. Our contributions are a time-aware fusion mechanism that directly models correspondence, an alignment-driven self-supervised objective tailored to EEG and physiology, and an evaluation protocol that measures alignment quality itself. Our approach accounts for the coupling between the central and autonomic nervous systems in psychophysiological time series. These results indicate that CTAF is a strong step toward label-efficient, generalizable EEG-peripheral fusion under temporal asynchrony.

Motivation: Develop physics foundation models for science and engineering that provide real-time solutions to PDEs while preserving structure and accuracy when adapting to unseen geometries.

Method: General-Geometry Neural Whitney Forms (Geo-NeW): a data-driven FEM that jointly learns differential operators and compatible reduced finite element spaces using Finite Element Exterior Calculus, with geometry incorporated via transformer encoding and as basis for FE spaces. Novel constitutive model parameterization ensures solution existence and uniqueness.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on steady-state PDE benchmarks and significant improvement over conventional baselines on out-of-distribution geometries.

Conclusion: The approach provides a powerful inductive bias by explicitly connecting geometry and boundary conditions to solutions, improving generalization for neural PDE learning.

Abstract: We aim to develop physics foundation models for science and engineering that provide real-time solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) which preserve structure and accuracy under adaptation to unseen geometries. To this end, we introduce General-Geometry Neural Whitney Forms (Geo-NeW): a data-driven finite element method. We jointly learn a differential operator and compatible reduced finite element spaces defined on the underlying geometry. The resulting model is solved to generate predictions, while exactly preserving physical conservation laws through Finite Element Exterior Calculus. Geometry enters the model as a discretized mesh both through a transformer-based encoding and as the basis for the learned finite element spaces. This explicitly connects the underlying geometry and imposed boundary conditions to the solution, providing a powerful inductive bias for learning neural PDEs, which we demonstrate improves generalization to unseen domains. We provide a novel parameterization of the constitutive model ensuring the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several steady-state PDE benchmarks, and provides a significant improvement over conventional baselines on out-of-distribution geometries.

Abstract: Flow matching learns a velocity field that transports a base distribution to data. We study how small latent perturbations propagate through these flows and show that Jacobian-vector products (JVPs) provide a practical lens on dependency structure in the generated features. We derive closed-form expressions for the optimal drift and its Jacobian in Gaussian and mixture-of-Gaussian settings, revealing that even globally nonlinear flows admit local affine structure. In low-dimensional synthetic benchmarks, numerical JVPs recover the analytical Jacobians. In image domains, composing the flow with an attribute classifier yields an attribute-level JVP estimator that recovers empirical correlations on MNIST and CelebA. Conditioning on small classifier-Jacobian norms reduces correlations in a way consistent with a hypothesized common-cause structure, while we emphasize that this conditioning is not a formal do intervention.

TL;DR: AgentOWL is a novel method that jointly learns abstract world models and hierarchical neural options to enable sample-efficient skill acquisition in AI agents, outperforming existing methods on Object-Centric Atari games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building AI agents that can compose new skills from existing ones is a long-standing challenge. Existing model-free hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, requiring large amounts of data to learn sequences of skills (hierarchical neural options).

Method: The paper proposes AgentOWL (Option and World model Learning Agent), which simultaneously learns an abstract world model (that abstracts across both states and time) and a set of hierarchical neural options in a sample-efficient manner.

Result: On a subset of Object-Centric Atari games, AgentOWL demonstrates superior performance by learning more skills while using significantly less data compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Jointly learning abstract world models and hierarchical options is an effective approach for sample-efficient skill acquisition, enabling agents to learn more capabilities with less data than traditional hierarchical reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: Building agents that can perform new skills by composing existing skills is a long-standing goal of AI agent research. Towards this end, we investigate how to efficiently acquire a sequence of skills, formalized as hierarchical neural options. However, existing model-free hierarchical reinforcement algorithms need a lot of data. We propose a novel method, which we call AgentOWL (Option and World model Learning Agent), that jointly learns -- in a sample efficient way -- an abstract world model (abstracting across both states and time) and a set of hierarchical neural options. We show, on a subset of Object-Centric Atari games, that our method can learn more skills using much less data than baseline methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper frames Membership Inference Attack (MIA) evaluation as a causal inference problem to address computational cost and statistical validity issues. It defines memorization as causal effect, identifies biases in one-run and zero-run methods, proposes causal estimators with theoretical guarantees, and demonstrates reliable privacy evaluation without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MIA evaluation requires computationally expensive repeated retraining for large models, while alternative one-run and zero-run methods lack clear statistical validity, making reliable privacy assessment challenging for modern AI systems.

Method: The authors formulate MIA evaluation as a causal inference problem, defining memorization as the causal effect of data inclusion. They identify bias sources (interference in one-run, confounding in zero-run), derive causal analogues of standard MIA metrics, and propose practical estimators for all three regimes with non-asymptotic consistency guarantees.

Result: Experiments on real-world data show the proposed approach enables reliable memorization measurement without retraining, maintains effectiveness under distribution shift, and provides valid privacy evaluation even when standard methods are impractical.

Conclusion: This causal framework establishes a principled statistical foundation for privacy evaluation in modern AI systems, enabling computationally feasible and statistically valid assessment of training data memorization.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely used to quantify training data memorization and assess privacy risks. Standard evaluation requires repeated retraining, which is computationally costly for large models. One-run methods (single training with randomized data inclusion) and zero-run methods (post hoc evaluation) are often used instead, though their statistical validity remains unclear. To address this gap, we frame MIA evaluation as a causal inference problem, defining memorization as the causal effect of including a data point in the training set. This novel formulation reveals and formalizes key sources of bias in existing protocols: one-run methods suffer from interference between jointly included points, while zero-run evaluations popular for LLMs are confounded by non-random membership assignment. We derive causal analogues of standard MIA metrics and propose practical estimators for multi-run, one-run, and zero-run regimes with non-asymptotic consistency guarantees. Experiments on real-world data show that our approach enables reliable memorization measurement even when retraining is impractical and under distribution shift, providing a principled foundation for privacy evaluation in modern AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矢量图形(SVG)在灵活性、尺寸效率和易编辑性方面优势明显，但因数值参数被低效编码为长token序列，导致训练慢、精度低、泛化差，研究不足

Method: 提出连续数值建模(CNM)，将数字视为连续值；在200万光栅-SVG样本上训练多模态Transformer；通过感知反馈的强化学习微调

Result: 训练速度提升超过30%，同时相比替代方法保持更高的感知保真度

Conclusion: CNM是高质量矢量生成的实用高效方法，具有更广泛应用潜力

Abstract: For certain image generation tasks, vector graphics such as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) offer clear benefits such as increased flexibility, size efficiency, and editing ease, but remain less explored than raster-based approaches. A core challenge is that the numerical, geometric parameters, which make up a large proportion of SVGs, are inefficiently encoded as long sequences of tokens. This slows training, reduces accuracy, and hurts generalization. To address these problems, we propose Continuous Number Modeling (CNM), an approach that directly models numbers as first-class, continuous values rather than discrete tokens. This formulation restores the mathematical elegance of the representation by aligning the model's inputs with the data's continuous nature, removing discretization artifacts introduced by token-based encoding. We then train a multimodal transformer on 2 million raster-to-SVG samples, followed by fine-tuning via reinforcement learning using perceptual feedback to further improve visual quality. Our approach improves training speed by over 30% while maintaining higher perceptual fidelity compared to alternative approaches. This work establishes CNM as a practical and efficient approach for high-quality vector generation, with potential for broader applications. We make our code available http://github.com/mikeogezi/CNM.

*Yingchuan Zhang,Terry Ma,Wenxuan Zhong,Ping Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PACER, a training-free framework that enables LLM reasoning traces to collaboratively revise each other via a consensus packet, outperforming standard majority voting on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard aggregation methods for LLM reasoning trajectories evaluate traces in isolation, creating a "blind spot" where hallucinated paths with misleadingly high confidence suppress correct solutions through voting, especially on difficult problems.

Method: PACER (Packet-Conditioned Revision) is an inference-only framework that: (1) screens generated traces, (2) constructs a consensus packet with candidate answers, confidence scores, and reasoning summaries, (3) conditions traces to perform targeted self-review to identify logical divergence points, and (4) applies confidence-weighted voting on revised trajectories.

Result: On challenging math benchmarks (AIME and BRUMO), PACER matches or exceeds 256-sample majority voting accuracy and significantly outperforms raw ensemble baselines by transforming consensus into collaborative logical refinement.

Conclusion: Enabling reasoning traces to "peer-review" each other through structured coordination effectively resolves near-miss errors from overconfident hallucinations, demonstrating that collaborative refinement at test-time improves LLM reasoning beyond isolated evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve higher accuracy on challenging reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute through multiple trajectory sampling. However, standard aggregation methods like majority voting or individual confidence-based filtering face a fundamental "blind spot": they evaluate each trace in isolation. As problems scale in difficulty, models often generate hallucinated paths that exhibit misleadingly high confidence, causing the true solution to be suppressed by a narrow margin in traditional voting. We ask: can we enable traces to "peer-review" each other to resolve these near-miss errors?
  We introduce Packet-Conditioned Revision (PACER), a training-free, inference-only framework that enables reasoning traces to revise their conclusions through a structured coordination step. After a preliminary screening of generated traces, PACER constructs a compact consensus packet containing (i) unique candidate answers, (ii) their aggregated confidence scores, and (iii) representative reasoning summaries for each candidate answer. Individual traces then perform a targeted self-review conditioned on this packet, allowing them to identify specific logical junctions where they diverged from the broader consensus and pivot if their original reasoning is found to be flawed. Final predictions are obtained via confidence-weighted voting over these revised trajectories. On challenging competitive math benchmarks such as AIME and BRUMO, PACER matches or exceeds the accuracy of 256-sample majority voting, significantly outperforming raw ensemble baselines by transforming simple consensus into a collaborative logical refinement process.

Motivation: 多元时间序列的因果发现面临多滞后交互、瞬时依赖及动态图组合爆炸的挑战，现有方法在稳定性和结构恢复精度上存在不足。

Method: 两阶段可微框架：阶段一通过节点级预测预筛选边生成滞后/瞬时边掩码；阶段二通过似然优化、稀疏约束及瞬时块无环性强化精炼掩码。

Result: 在合成与基准动力系统数据上，SC3D相比现有时序基线显著提升滞后和瞬时因果结构恢复的稳定性与准确性。

Conclusion: SC3D通过可微优化有效平衡组合搜索与结构约束，为复杂时序因果发现提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Discovering causal structures from multivariate time series is a key problem because interactions span across multiple lags and possibly involve instantaneous dependencies. Additionally, the search space of the dynamic graphs is combinatorial in nature. In this study, we propose \textit{Stable Causal Dynamic Differentiable Discovery (SC3D)}, a two-stage differentiable framework that jointly learns lag-specific adjacency matrices and, if present, an instantaneous directed acyclic graph (DAG). In Stage 1, SC3D performs edge preselection through node-wise prediction to obtain masks for lagged and instantaneous edges, whereas Stage 2 refines these masks by optimizing a likelihood with sparsity along with enforcing acyclicity on the instantaneous block. Numerical results across synthetic and benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate that SC3D achieves improved stability and more accurate recovery of both lagged and instantaneous causal structures compared to existing temporal baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer在处理结构化数据的多跳关系推理任务时存在局限，理论分析表明其需要Ω(k)层才能完成k跳推理，计算开销大且效率不足。

Method: 提出关系感知稀疏注意力机制RASA，通过边类型嵌入向注意力分数注入关系结构信息，并引入稀疏掩码将注意力限制在图邻接位置，实现显式关系路由并降低搜索空间复杂度。

Result: 在MetaQA（1/2/3跳）和WebQuestionsSP数据集上的实验表明，RASA性能优于标准Transformer且能以更低成本达到GPT-4水平，3跳推理任务上提升7.1分，优势随推理深度增加而扩大。

Conclusion: 最小化的结构修改（边嵌入+稀疏注意力）能显著增强Transformer的多跳推理能力，实验验证有效；但缺乏形式化学习保证，主要贡献为经验性验证。

Abstract: Transformers achieve remarkable performance across many domains, yet struggle with tasks requiring multi-hop relational reasoning over structured data. We analyze this limitation through circuit complexity: standard transformers are $\mathsf{TC}^0$-complete and require $Ω(k)$ layers for $k$-hop reasoning. We introduce RASA (Relation-Aware Sparse Attention), a minimal modification adding: (1) edge-type embeddings that inject relational structure into attention scores, and (2) sparse masking that restricts attention to graph-adjacent positions. While RASA has the same asymptotic depth requirements, sparse masking reduces the attention search space from $O(2^{n^2})$ to $O(2^m)$ patterns, and edge biases provide explicit relation routing. Empirically, on MetaQA (1/2/3-hop) and WebQuestionsSP, RASA outperforms standard transformers and matches GPT-4 at lower cost, with advantages growing with reasoning depth (+7.1 points on 3-hop). We do not claim formal learnability guarantees; the contribution is empirical validation that minimal structural modifications substantially improve multi-hop reasoning.

TL;DR: GeLDA is a semantics-aware generative data augmentation framework that uses conditional diffusion models in foundation model latent spaces to address data scarcity, achieving 6.13% improvement in zero-shot speech emotion recognition and 74.7% tail-class accuracy (SOTA) on ImageNet-LT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning underperforms in data-scarce settings, and foundation models still struggle with limited labeled data during downstream fine-tuning, hindering their effectiveness in low-resource domains.

Method: GeLDA leverages conditional diffusion models to synthesize samples in a low-dimensional, task-relevant latent space induced by foundation models, conditioning generation on auxiliary semantic feature vectors that capture class/subdomain relationships.

Result: In zero-shot language-specific speech emotion recognition, GeLDA improves Whisper-large baseline's unweighted average recall by 6.13%; in long-tailed image classification, it achieves 74.7% tail-class accuracy on ImageNet-LT, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: GeLDA enables efficient, high-quality data generation in foundation model latent spaces, effectively addressing data scarcity in downstream tasks and demonstrating strong generalization across both speech and vision domains.

Abstract: Despite strong performance in data-rich regimes, deep learning often underperforms in the data-scarce settings common in practice. While foundation models (FMs) trained on massive datasets demonstrate strong generalization by extracting general-purpose features, they can still suffer from scarce labeled data during downstream fine-tuning. To address this, we propose GeLDA, a semantics-aware generative latent data augmentation framework that leverages conditional diffusion models to synthesize samples in an FM-induced latent space. Because this space is low-dimensional and concentrates task-relevant information compared to the input space, GeLDA enables efficient, high-quality data generation. GeLDA conditions generation on auxiliary feature vectors that capture semantic relationships among classes or subdomains, facilitating data augmentation in low-resource domains. We validate GeLDA in two large-scale recognition tasks: (a) in zero-shot language-specific speech emotion recognition, GeLDA improves the Whisper-large baseline's unweighted average recall by 6.13%; and (b) in long-tailed image classification, it achieves 74.7% tail-class accuracy on ImageNet-LT, setting a new state-of-the-art result.

Abstract: Expressive policies based on flow-matching have been successfully applied in reinforcement learning (RL) more recently due to their ability to model complex action distributions from offline data. These algorithms build on standard policy gradients, which assume that there is no unmeasured confounding in the data. However, this condition does not necessarily hold for pixel-based demonstrations when a mismatch exists between the demonstrator's and the learner's sensory capabilities, leading to implicit confounding biases in offline data. We address the challenge by investigating the problem of confounded observations in offline RL from a causal perspective. We develop a novel causal offline RL objective that optimizes policies' worst-case performance that may arise due to confounding biases. Based on this new objective, we introduce a practical implementation that learns expressive flow-matching policies from confounded demonstrations, employing a deep discriminator to assess the discrepancy between the target policy and the nominal behavioral policy. Experiments across 25 pixel-based tasks demonstrate that our proposed confounding-robust augmentation procedure achieves a success rate 120\% that of confounding-unaware, state-of-the-art offline RL methods.

Conclusion: ZS‑SVD 提供了一种高效、后训练的 SVD 压缩方案，通过全局奇异分量选择与零和约束，自动实现异质秩分配，显著降低模型开销，同时保持或提升模型质量，代码已开源。

Abstract: Advances in large language models have driven strong performance across many tasks, but their memory and compute costs still hinder deployment. SVD-based compression reduces storage and can speed up inference via low-rank factors, yet performance depends on how rank is allocated under a global compression ratio. Prior methods often use homogeneous ranks for similarly sized matrices, despite large differences in loss sensitivity, or rely on expensive iterative pre-truncation optimization to determine per matrix ranks. We propose \textbf{Zero Sum SVD} (\textbf{ZS-SVD}), a post-training method that performs \emph{global} singular component selection using activation whitening and first-order calibration loss estimates in whitened coordinates. \textbf{ZS-SVD} prunes components across the whole model with a \textbf{zero sum} rule that keeps the cumulative predicted loss change near zero, automatically yielding heterogeneous ranks without solving a rank allocation optimization. Motivated by evidence that gradients near pretrained solutions exhibit low rank structure, we also introduce an optional lightweight correction that applies a \textbf{single} projected gradient update after truncation, followed by re-truncation. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures show consistent gains across diverse benchmarks and compression ratios. Code is available at https://github.com/mint-vu/Zero-Sum-SVD

### [191] [Recurrent Equivariant Constraint Modulation: Learning Per-Layer Symmetry Relaxation from Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02853)
*Stefanos Pertigkiozoglou,Mircea Petrache,Shubhendu Trivedi,Kostas Daniilidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes RECM, a learned layer-wise relaxation mechanism for equivariant neural networks that automatically adapts to each layer's symmetry gap, improving performance without manual tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strict equivariance constraints can hinder learning through complex optimization dynamics, and existing relaxation methods require costly, task-dependent manual tuning of target relaxation levels per layer.

Method: Recurrent Equivariant Constraint Modulation (RECM): a layer-wise mechanism that learns appropriate relaxation levels solely from training signals and symmetry properties of each layer's input-target distribution, without prior task knowledge.

Result: Theoretically, RECM provably converges to relaxation levels upper-bounded by each layer's symmetry gap, enabling full equivariance for symmetric layers and flexibility for approximate ones. Empirically, RECM outperforms prior methods across diverse equivariant tasks including molecular conformer generation on GEOM-Drugs.

Conclusion: RECM automatically discovers optimal per-layer equivariance relaxation, outperforming manually-tuned baselines by adapting to the true symmetry level of each layer's data distribution.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks exploit underlying task symmetries to improve generalization, but strict equivariance constraints can induce more complex optimization dynamics that can hinder learning. Prior work addresses these limitations by relaxing strict equivariance during training, but typically relies on prespecified, explicit, or implicit target levels of relaxation for each network layer, which are task-dependent and costly to tune. We propose Recurrent Equivariant Constraint Modulation (RECM), a layer-wise constraint modulation mechanism that learns appropriate relaxation levels solely from the training signal and the symmetry properties of each layer's input-target distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge about the task-dependent target relaxation level. We demonstrate that under the proposed RECM update, the relaxation level of each layer provably converges to a value upper-bounded by its symmetry gap, namely the degree to which its input-target distribution deviates from exact symmetry. Consequently, layers processing symmetric distributions recover full equivariance, while those with approximate symmetries retain sufficient flexibility to learn non-symmetric solutions when warranted by the data. Empirically, RECM outperforms prior methods across diverse exact and approximate equivariant tasks, including the challenging molecular conformer generation on the GEOM-Drugs dataset.

Motivation: 许多机器学习问题涉及对数期望指数损失函数，当求和项数量巨大时计算代价昂贵。现有优化算法存在不收敛、数值不稳定和收敛速度慢等根本性限制。

Method: 针对熵风险最小化的对偶形式（极小-极小问题），提出SCENT算法，使用基于负指数函数Bregman散度的随机近端镜像下降更新，忠实捕捉目标函数几何结构。

Conclusion: SCENT算法有效解决了组合熵风险最小化现有方法的根本局限，在提供理论保证的同时，在实际应用中展现出显著性能提升。

Abstract: This paper studies optimization for a family of problems termed $\textbf{compositional entropic risk minimization}$, in which each data's loss is formulated as a Log-Expectation-Exponential (Log-E-Exp) function. The Log-E-Exp formulation serves as an abstraction of the Log-Sum-Exponential (LogSumExp) function when the explicit summation inside the logarithm is taken over a gigantic number of items and is therefore expensive to evaluate. While entropic risk objectives of this form arise in many machine learning problems, existing optimization algorithms suffer from several fundamental limitations including non-convergence, numerical instability, and slow convergence rates. To address these limitations, we propose a geometry-aware stochastic algorithm, termed $\textbf{SCENT}$, for the dual formulation of entropic risk minimization cast as a min--min optimization problem. The key to our design is a $\textbf{stochastic proximal mirror descent (SPMD)}$ update for the dual variable, equipped with a Bregman divergence induced by a negative exponential function that faithfully captures the geometry of the objective. Our main contributions are threefold: (i) we establish an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate of the proposed SCENT algorithm for convex problems; (ii) we theoretically characterize the advantages of SPMD over standard SGD update for optimizing the dual variable; and (iii) we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of SCENT on extreme classification, partial AUC maximization, contrastive learning and distributionally robust optimization, where it consistently outperforms existing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出Mixture of Concept Bottleneck Experts (M-CBEs)框架，通过引入多专家混合结构和灵活函数形式，解决传统概念瓶颈模型预测器固定导致的准确性与适应性局限，在准确率-可解释性权衡中提供更优解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)将任务预测器固定为单一线性或布尔表达式，限制了预测精度和适应多样化用户需求的能力，亟需突破这一设计约束。

Method: 提出M-CBEs框架，从专家数量和专家函数形式两个维度泛化CBMs：1) 线性M-CBE学习有限线性表达式集合；2) 符号M-CBE通过符号回归在用户指定算子词汇下从数据中自动发现专家函数。

Result: 实验表明，通过调整混合规模（专家数量）和函数形式，该框架能有效探索准确率-可解释性权衡空间，适应不同用户和任务需求。

Conclusion: M-CBEs揭示了CBMs设计中未充分探索的区域，为构建兼顾高精度与强适应性的可解释模型提供了鲁棒框架。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) promote interpretability by grounding predictions in human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs typically fix their task predictor to a single linear or Boolean expression, limiting both predictive accuracy and adaptability to diverse user needs. We propose Mixture of Concept Bottleneck Experts (M-CBEs), a framework that generalizes existing CBMs along two dimensions: the number of experts and the functional form of each expert, exposing an underexplored region of the design space. We investigate this region by instantiating two novel models: Linear M-CBE, which learns a finite set of linear expressions, and Symbolic M-CBE, which leverages symbolic regression to discover expert functions from data under user-specified operator vocabularies. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that varying the mixture size and functional form provides a robust framework for navigating the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, adapting to different user and task needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型汤仅适用于监督学习，无法利用无标签数据或适应任务迁移/鲁棒性需求；自监督学习（SSL）缺乏构建多样化模型汤的方法

Method: 1. 基于基础模型（stock）通过不同SSL算法（如MAE、MoCoV3、MMCR）或不同数据源（如带噪声数据）训练多个模型（ingredients）<br>2. 将多个模型的参数平均融合（soup）生成新模型<br>3. 在带噪声测试数据上"Self-Souping"后，再在无噪声训练数据上微调

Result: 1. 在ImageNet-C和LAION-C上鲁棒性分别提升+3.5%和+7%<br>2. 首次证明模型汤的"ingredients"可使用不同SSL超参数甚至不同SSL算法<br>3. 混合MAE/MoCoV3/MMCR的模型汤性能超越任一单一SSL模型

Conclusion: Self-Soupervision突破了监督学习的限制，使SSL能构建多样化模型汤，显著提升模型鲁棒性；算法多样性是构建高效模型汤的关键新维度

Abstract: Model soups are strange and strangely effective combinations of parameters. They take a model (the stock), fine-tune it into multiple models (the ingredients), and then mix their parameters back into one model (the soup) to improve predictions. While all known soups require supervised learning, and optimize the same loss on labeled data, our recipes for Self-\emph{Soup}ervision generalize soups to self-supervised learning (SSL). Our Self-Souping lets us flavor ingredients on new data sources, e.g. from unlabeled data from a task for transfer or from a shift for robustness. We show that Self-Souping on corrupted test data, then fine-tuning back on uncorrupted train data, boosts robustness by +3.5\% (ImageNet-C) and +7\% (LAION-C). Self-\emph{Soup}ervision also unlocks countless SSL algorithms to cook the diverse ingredients needed for more robust soups. We show for the first time that ingredients can differ in their SSL hyperparameters -- and more surprisingly, in their SSL algorithms. We cook soups of MAE, MoCoV3, and MMCR ingredients that are more accurate than any one single SSL ingredient.

*Zesen Wang,Mikael Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSGD-AC challenges the belief that decentralized training is inferior by intentionally preserving structured consensus errors that act as implicit regularizers, guiding optimization toward flatter minima and outperforming centralized SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overturn the conventional view that consensus errors in decentralized training harm convergence/generalization, proposing these errors can be beneficial structured perturbations rather than random noise.

Method: Introducing Decentralized SGD with Adaptive Consensus (DSGD-AC) using a time-dependent scaling mechanism to preserve non-vanishing consensus errors, with theoretical proof that errors align with the dominant Hessian subspace.

Result: DSGD-AC consistently exceeds standard DSGD and centralized SGD in test accuracy and solution flatness across image classification and machine translation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Consensus errors serve as a useful implicit regularizer that promotes flatter minima, enabling superior decentralized learning and reframing algorithm design perspectives.

Abstract: Decentralized training is often regarded as inferior to centralized training because the consensus errors between workers are thought to undermine convergence and generalization, even with homogeneous data distributions. This work challenges this view by introducing decentralized SGD with Adaptive Consensus (DSGD-AC), which intentionally preserves non-vanishing consensus errors through a time-dependent scaling mechanism. We prove that these errors are not random noise but systematically align with the dominant Hessian subspace, acting as structured perturbations that guide optimization toward flatter minima. Across image classification and machine translation benchmarks, DSGD-AC consistently surpasses both standard DSGD and centralized SGD in test accuracy and solution flatness. Together, these results establish consensus errors as a useful implicit regularizer and open a new perspective on the design of decentralized learning algorithms.

*Zeyu Fang,Zuyuan Zhang,Mahdi Imani,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MC-ETM, a model-based offline RL method using energy-based transition models with manifold-constrained negative sampling to mitigate distribution shift errors, enabling safer policy optimization via energy-based truncation and pessimistic penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-based offline RL suffers from severe value overestimation due to compounding model errors when policy improvement generates out-of-distribution state-action rollouts, especially under sparse data coverage.

Method: Trains conditional energy-based transition models using a manifold projection-diffusion sampler to learn latent state manifolds; generates near-manifold hard negatives via latent perturbation and Langevin dynamics; uses energy as a reliability signal for rollout truncation and pessimistic Q-value penalties during policy optimization.

Result: Improves multi-step dynamics fidelity and achieves higher normalized returns on standard offline control benchmarks, particularly in scenarios with irregular dynamics and sparse data coverage.

Conclusion: MC-ETM effectively separates in-support evaluation error from truncation risk via a hybrid pessimistic MDP framework, providing conservative performance guarantees while outperforming existing methods in distribution-shifted environments.

Abstract: Model-based offline reinforcement learning is brittle under distribution shift: policy improvement drives rollouts into state--action regions weakly supported by the dataset, where compounding model error yields severe value overestimation. We propose Manifold-Constrained Energy-based Transition Models (MC-ETM), which train conditional energy-based transition models using a manifold projection--diffusion negative sampler. MC-ETM learns a latent manifold of next states and generates near-manifold hard negatives by perturbing latent codes and running Langevin dynamics in latent space with the learned conditional energy, sharpening the energy landscape around the dataset support and improving sensitivity to subtle out-of-distribution deviations. For policy optimization, the learned energy provides a single reliability signal: rollouts are truncated when the minimum energy over sampled next states exceeds a threshold, and Bellman backups are stabilized via pessimistic penalties based on Q-value-level dispersion across energy-guided samples. We formalize MC-ETM through a hybrid pessimistic MDP formulation and derive a conservative performance bound separating in-support evaluation error from truncation risk. Empirically, MC-ETM improves multi-step dynamics fidelity and yields higher normalized returns on standard offline control benchmarks, particularly under irregular dynamics and sparse data coverage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models trained on different data subsets produce similar outputs due to shared Gaussian statistics. We use Random Matrix Theory to show how finite datasets cause overshrinkage toward the mean and reveal three factors behind cross-split variations, validated on UNet/DiT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why diffusion models trained on different data subsets produce consistent outputs, and quantifying how finite dataset size affects the stability and reproducibility of generated samples.

Method: Develop a Random Matrix Theory (RMT) framework analyzing linear diffusion models. Derive self-consistent relations for noise renormalization and variance formulas. Extend deterministic-equivalence to fractional matrix powers for full trajectory analysis.

Result: Show that sampling variability renormalizes noise levels, causing overshrinkage of low-variance directions toward dataset mean. Identify three factors for cross-split disagreement: anisotropy, inhomogeneity, and dataset size scaling. Theory matches linear models and predicts behavior of UNet/DiT in non-memorization regime.

Conclusion: Provides a principled baseline for reproducibility in diffusion training, linking data spectral properties to output stability. Helps understand where and how samples deviate across training splits.

Abstract: Diffusion models trained on different, non-overlapping subsets of a dataset often produce strikingly similar outputs when given the same noise seed. We trace this consistency to a simple linear effect: the shared Gaussian statistics across splits already predict much of the generated images. To formalize this, we develop a random matrix theory (RMT) framework that quantifies how finite datasets shape the expectation and variance of the learned denoiser and sampling map in the linear setting. For expectations, sampling variability acts as a renormalization of the noise level through a self-consistent relation $σ^2 \mapsto κ(σ^2)$, explaining why limited data overshrink low-variance directions and pull samples toward the dataset mean. For fluctuations, our variance formulas reveal three key factors behind cross-split disagreement: \textit{anisotropy} across eigenmodes, \textit{inhomogeneity} across inputs, and overall scaling with dataset size. Extending deterministic-equivalence tools to fractional matrix powers further allows us to analyze entire sampling trajectories. The theory sharply predicts the behavior of linear diffusion models, and we validate its predictions on UNet and DiT architectures in their non-memorization regime, identifying where and how samples deviates across training data split. This provides a principled baseline for reproducibility in diffusion training, linking spectral properties of data to the stability of generative outputs.

### [198] [Notes on the Reward Representation of Posterior Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02912)
*Pedro A. Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies when KL-regularized reinforcement learning updates can be interpreted as literal Bayesian inference, revealing that rewards are ambiguous up to context-specific baselines while behavioral changes are driven by relative incentive signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern control and RL often metaphorically treat decision-making as inference (updating a baseline distribution with signals). The paper asks when this can be made literal—i.e., when KL-regularized updates exactly equal Bayesian posteriors in a fixed probabilistic model.

Method: Studies the special case where KL-regularized soft updates are precisely Bayesian posteriors within a single fixed model, treating the update variable as a genuine information channel transmitting evidence.

Result: Posterior updates determine relative, context-dependent incentive signals that shift behavior but cannot uniquely determine absolute rewards, which remain ambiguous up to context-specific baselines. A reusable continuation value across update directions imposes coherence constraints linking reward descriptions for different conditioning orders.

Conclusion: When KL-regularized updates are literal Bayesian posteriors, behavioral change is driven purely by evidence reweighting, revealing fundamental ambiguity in reward specification and coherence requirements for consistent value functions across different update directions.

Abstract: Many ideas in modern control and reinforcement learning treat decision-making as inference: start from a baseline distribution and update it when a signal arrives. We ask when this can be made literal rather than metaphorical. We study the special case where a KL-regularized soft update is exactly a Bayesian posterior inside a single fixed probabilistic model, so the update variable is a genuine channel through which information is transmitted. In this regime, behavioral change is driven only by evidence carried by that channel: the update must be explainable as an evidence reweighing of the baseline. This yields a sharp identification result: posterior updates determine the relative, context-dependent incentive signal that shifts behavior, but they do not uniquely determine absolute rewards, which remain ambiguous up to context-specific baselines. Requiring one reusable continuation value across different update directions adds a further coherence constraint linking the reward descriptions associated with different conditioning orders.

Abstract: Advances in wearable computing and AI have increased interest in leveraging PPG for health monitoring over the past decade. One of the biggest challenges in developing health algorithms based on such biosignals is the sparsity of clinical labels, which makes biosignals temporally distant from lab draws less reliable for supervision. To address this problem, we introduce a simple training strategy that learns a biomarker-specific decay of sample weight over the time gap between a segment and its ground truth label and uses this weight in the loss with a regularizer to prevent trivial solutions. On smartwatch PPG from 450 participants across 10 biomarkers, the approach improves over baselines. In the subject-wise setting, the proposed approach averages 0.715 AUPRC, compared to 0.674 for a fine-tuned self-supervised baseline and 0.626 for a feature-based Random Forest. A comparison of four decay families shows that a simple linear decay function is most robust on average. Beyond accuracy, the learned decay rates summarize how quickly each biomarker's PPG evidence becomes stale, providing an interpretable view of temporal sensitivity.

Conclusion: ALGD通过增广拉格朗日方法有效解决扩散安全强化学习的稳定性问题，为在线安全强化学习提供新范式

Abstract: Diffusion policy sampling enables reinforcement learning (RL) to represent multimodal action distributions beyond suboptimal unimodal Gaussian policies. However, existing diffusion-based RL methods primarily focus on offline settings for reward maximization, with limited consideration of safety in online settings. To address this gap, we propose Augmented Lagrangian-Guided Diffusion (ALGD), a novel algorithm for off-policy safe RL. By revisiting optimization theory and energy-based model, we show that the instability of primal-dual methods arises from the non-convex Lagrangian landscape. In diffusion-based safe RL, the Lagrangian can be interpreted as an energy function guiding the denoising dynamics. Counterintuitively, direct usage destabilizes both policy generation and training. ALGD resolves this issue by introducing an augmented Lagrangian that locally convexifies the energy landscape, yielding a stabilized policy generation and training process without altering the distribution of the optimal policy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that ALGD is both theoretically grounded and empirically effective, achieving strong and stable performance across diverse environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes SDA2E, a sparse dual adversarial attention autoencoder with a similarity-guided active learning framework for detecting rare anomalies in imbalanced datasets. The method uses three novel strategies (normal-like expansion, anomaly-like prioritization, and hybrid) to reduce labeling needs by up to 80% while achieving superior ranking performance on 52 datasets including cybersecurity APT detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting rare anomalies like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in highly imbalanced datasets remains a fundamental challenge. While active learning can minimize labeling effort, conventional approaches fail to exploit the intrinsic geometric structure of the feature space for effective model refinement.

Method: The authors introduce SDA2E (Sparse Dual Adversarial Attention-based AutoEncoder) to learn compact latent representations. They propose a similarity-guided active learning framework with three strategies: normal-like expansion to enrich training with normal-similar points, anomaly-like prioritization to focus on anomaly-similar points, and a hybrid strategy. A new similarity measure SIM_NM1 is designed for sparse binary embeddings.

Result: Evaluated across 52 imbalanced datasets (including DARPA Transparent Computing scenarios) against 15 state-of-the-art methods, SDA2E achieved superior ranking performance (nDCG up to 1.0) while reducing required labeled data by up to 80% compared to passive training, with statistically significant improvements confirmed.

Conclusion: The work establishes a robust, efficient, and statistically validated framework for anomaly detection that is particularly suited to cybersecurity applications such as APT detection, demonstrating that strategic similarity-guided active learning can dramatically reduce labeling costs while improving detection performance.

Abstract: Detecting rare and diverse anomalies in highly imbalanced datasets-such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in cybersecurity-remains a fundamental challenge for machine learning systems. Active learning offers a promising direction by strategically querying an oracle to minimize labeling effort, yet conventional approaches often fail to exploit the intrinsic geometric structure of the feature space for model refinement. In this paper, we introduce SDA2E, a Sparse Dual Adversarial Attention-based AutoEncoder designed to learn compact and discriminative latent representations from imbalanced, high-dimensional data. We further propose a similarity-guided active learning framework that integrates three novel strategies to refine decision boundaries efficiently: mormal-like expansion, which enriches the training set with points similar to labeled normals to improve reconstruction fidelity; anomaly-like prioritization, which boosts ranking accuracy by focusing on points resembling known anomalies; and a hybrid strategy that combines both for balanced model refinement and ranking. A key component of our framework is a new similarity measure, Normalized Matching 1s (SIM_NM1), tailored for sparse binary embeddings. We evaluate SDA2E extensively across 52 imbalanced datasets, including multiple DARPA Transparent Computing scenarios, and benchmark it against 15 state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Results demonstrate that SDA2E consistently achieves superior ranking performance (nDCG up to 1.0 in several cases) while reducing the required labeled data by up to 80% compared to passive training. Statistical tests confirm the significance of these improvements. Our work establishes a robust, efficient, and statistically validated framework for anomaly detection that is particularly suited to cybersecurity applications such as APT detection.

TL;DR: 提出Distance Marching，一种基于距离场建模的时间无条件生成模型，通过聚焦更近目标的损失函数改进去噪方向，在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上FID提升13.5%，且仅需60%采样步数即可超越flow matching。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间无条件生成模型缺乏时间条件，导致同一噪声输入对应多个噪声级别和去噪方向，干扰监督信号。

Method: 受距离场建模启发，提出Distance Marching，设计聚焦更近目标的损失函数，使去噪方向更好指向数据流形，并提供两种推理方法。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上FID consistently提升13.5%；类别条件ImageNet生成中无需时间输入即超越flow matching；仅需60%采样步数即达到flow matching最终性能，平均FID降低13.6%；距离预测支持采样早停和OOD检测。

Conclusion: 距离场建模可为生成建模提供规范性视角。

Abstract: Time-unconditional generative models learn time-independent denoising vector fields. But without time conditioning, the same noisy input may correspond to multiple noise levels and different denoising directions, which interferes with the supervision signal. Inspired by distance field modeling, we propose Distance Marching, a new time-unconditional approach with two principled inference methods. Crucially, we design losses that focus on closer targets. This yields denoising directions better directed toward the data manifold. Across architectures, Distance Marching consistently improves FID by 13.5% on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet over recent time-unconditional baselines. For class-conditional ImageNet generation, despite removing time input, Distance Marching surpasses flow matching using our losses and inference methods. It achieves lower FID than flow matching's final performance using 60% of the sampling steps and 13.6% lower FID on average across backbone sizes. Moreover, our distance prediction is also helpful for early stopping during sampling and for OOD detection. We hope distance field modeling can serve as a principled lens for generative modeling.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neuro-symbolic anomaly detection framework that combines Graph Autoencoders with rare pattern mining to identify APT-like activities, demonstrating substantial performance improvements on DARPA datasets by boosting anomaly scores for rare behavioral signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, long-term cyberattacks that are difficult to detect because they operate stealthily and blend into normal system behavior.

Method: A neuro-symbolic framework that constructs process behavioral graphs using k-NN, learns normal relational structure with a Graph Autoencoder (GAE), identifies anomalies through reconstruction deviations, and integrates rare pattern mining to discover infrequent behavioral co-occurrences for boosting anomaly scores.

Result: Evaluated on DARPA Transparent Computing datasets, rare-pattern boosting yields substantial gains in anomaly ranking quality over baseline GAE, consistently outperforms individual context-based detectors, and achieves performance competitive with ensemble aggregation methods.

Conclusion: Coupling graph-based representation learning with classical pattern mining improves both effectiveness and interpretability in provenance-based security anomaly detection.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, long-term cyberattacks that are difficult to detect because they operate stealthily and often blend into normal system behavior. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic anomaly detection framework that combines a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with rare pattern mining to identify APT-like activities in system-level provenance data. Our approach first constructs a process behavioral graph using k-Nearest Neighbors based on feature similarity, then learns normal relational structure using a Graph Autoencoder. Anomaly candidates are identified through deviations between observed and reconstructed graph structure. To further improve detection, we integrate an rare pattern mining module that discovers infrequent behavioral co-occurrences and uses them to boost anomaly scores for processes exhibiting rare signatures. We evaluate the proposed method on the DARPA Transparent Computing datasets and show that rare-pattern boosting yields substantial gains in anomaly ranking quality over the baseline GAE. Compared with existing unsupervised approaches on the same benchmark, our single unified model consistently outperforms individual context-based detectors and achieves performance competitive with ensemble aggregation methods that require multiple separate detectors. These results highlight the value of coupling graph-based representation learning with classical pattern mining to improve both effectiveness and interpretability in provenance-based security anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 该数据集为创伤脓毒症早期预警提供关键资源，推动开发更精准的临床决策支持工具

Abstract: Sepsis is a major public health concern due to its high morbidity, mortality, and cost. Its clinical outcome can be substantially improved through early detection and timely intervention. By leveraging publicly available datasets, machine learning (ML) has driven advances in both research and clinical practice. However, existing public datasets consider ICU patients (Intensive Care Unit) as a uniform group and neglect the potential challenges presented by critically ill trauma patients in whom injury-related inflammation and organ dysfunction can overlap with the clinical features of sepsis. We propose that a targeted identification of post-traumatic sepsis is necessary in order to develop methods for early detection. Therefore, we introduce a publicly available standardized post-trauma sepsis onset dataset extracted, relabeled using standardized post-trauma clinical facts, and validated from MIMIC-III. Furthermore, we frame early detection of post-trauma sepsis onset according to clinical workflow in ICUs in a daily basis resulting in a new rare event detection problem. We then establish a general benchmark through comprehensive experiments, which shows the necessity of further advancements using this new dataset. The data code is available at https://github.com/ML4UWHealth/SepsisOnset_TraumaCohort.git.

Conclusion: vsPAIR是一种能够同时提供可解释性和结构化不确定性估计的逆问题求解器。

Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to many scientific and engineering disciplines; they arise when one seeks to reconstruct hidden, underlying quantities from noisy measurements. Many applications demand not just point estimates but interpretable uncertainty. Providing fast inference alongside uncertainty estimates remains challenging yet desirable in numerous applications.
  We propose the Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoder (vsPAIR) to address this challenge. The architecture pairs a standard VAE encoding observations with a sparse VAE encoding quantities of interest, connected through a learned latent mapping. The variational structure enables uncertainty estimation, the paired architecture encourages interpretability by anchoring QoI representations to clean data, and sparse encodings provide structure by concentrating information into identifiable factors rather than diffusing across all dimensions. We also propose modifications to existing sparse VAE methods: a hard-concrete spike-and-slab relaxation for differentiable training and a beta hyperprior for adaptive sparsity levels. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture, we conduct experiments on blind inpainting and computed tomography, demonstrating that vsPAIR is a capable inverse problem solver that can provide interpretable and structured uncertainty estimates.

TL;DR: A training-free KV cache quantization framework called Quant VideoGen (QVG) reduces memory usage by 7x with minimal latency overhead while improving video generation quality by leveraging spatiotemporal redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache memory in autoregressive video diffusion models grows rapidly with generation history, exceeding 30GB and preventing deployment on standard hardware. More critically, memory constraints limit effective working memory, degrading long-term consistency in video identity, layout, and motion.

Method: QVG uses two key techniques: (1) Semantic Aware Smoothing to exploit video spatiotemporal redundancy and produce quantization-friendly low-magnitude residuals, and (2) Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse-to-fine multi-stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling flexible quality-memory tradeoffs.

Result: On LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG reduces KV cache memory by up to 7.0x with less than 4% latency overhead, establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, and consistently outperforms existing baselines in generation quality.

Conclusion: QVG successfully addresses the KV cache memory bottleneck in autoregressive video generation through training-free quantization, enabling deployment on widely available hardware while maintaining superior generation quality and long-term consistency.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autoregressive video diffusion, an emerging system algorithm bottleneck limits both deployability and generation capability: KV cache memory. In autoregressive video generation models, the KV cache grows with generation history and quickly dominates GPU memory, often exceeding 30 GB, preventing deployment on widely available hardware. More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals. It further introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse to fine multi stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling a smooth quality memory trade off. Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end to end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality.

Result: 在墨尔本7个真实场景中，相比现有DRL和基准方法，显著减少受阻出行者数量；模型在不同设置下方差极小，鲁棒性强

Conclusion: 该框架实现了更公平的交通信号系统，为复杂城市交通条件提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Coordinating traffic signals along multimodal corridors is challenging because many multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches remain vehicle-centric and struggle with high-dimensional discrete action spaces. We propose MA2B-DDQN, a human-centric multi-agent action-branching double Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework that explicitly optimizes traveler-level equity. Our key contribution is an action-branching discrete control formulation that decomposes corridor control into (i) local, per-intersection actions that allocate green time between the next two phases and (ii) a single global action that selects the total duration of those phases. This decomposition enables scalable coordination under discrete control while reducing the effective complexity of joint decision-making. We also design a human-centric reward that penalizes the number of delayed individuals in the corridor, accounting for pedestrians, vehicle occupants, and transit passengers. Extensive evaluations across seven realistic traffic scenarios in Melbourne, Australia, demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of impacted travelers, outperforming existing DRL and baseline methods. Experiments confirm the robustness of our model, showing minimal variance across diverse settings. This framework not only advocates for a fairer traffic signal system but also provides a scalable solution adaptable to varied urban traffic conditions.

Motivation: 经典差分隐私梯度下降(DP-SGD)无法利用量子梯度估计的独特性质，在量子机器学习中面临隐私保护挑战，需要开发适配QML特性的隐私机制

Method: 引入差分隐私参数平移规则(Q-ShiftDP)，结合精心校准的高斯噪声与量子内在噪声，为量子梯度计算提供形式化的隐私和效用保证

Result: 在基准数据集实验中，Q-ShiftDP在量子机器学习任务上持续优于经典差分隐私方法，实现了更好的隐私-效用权衡

Conclusion: 该工作是首个专为QML设计的隐私机制，通过利用量子噪声特性，为量子计算环境下的数据隐私保护提供了新方向

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) promises significant computational advantages, but preserving training data privacy remains challenging. Classical approaches like differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) add noise to gradients but fail to exploit the unique properties of quantum gradient estimation. In this work, we introduce the Differentially Private Parameter-Shift Rule (Q-ShiftDP), the first privacy mechanism tailored to QML. By leveraging the inherent boundedness and stochasticity of quantum gradients computed via the parameter-shift rule, Q-ShiftDP enables tighter sensitivity analysis and reduces noise requirements. We combine carefully calibrated Gaussian noise with intrinsic quantum noise to provide formal privacy and utility guarantees, and show that harnessing quantum noise further improves the privacy-utility trade-off. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Q-ShiftDP consistently outperforms classical DP methods in QML.

Abstract: Constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces a fundamental tension between exploration and safety-constrained optimization. Existing leading approaches, such as Lagrangian methods, typically rely on global penalties or centralized critics that react to violations after they occur, often suppressing exploration and leading to over-conservatism. We propose Co2PO, a novel MARL communication-augmented framework that enables coordination-driven safety through selective, risk-aware communication. Co2PO introduces a shared blackboard architecture for broadcasting positional intent and yield signals, governed by a learned hazard predictor that proactively forecasts potential violations over an extended temporal horizon. By integrating these forecasts into a constrained optimization objective, Co2PO allows agents to anticipate and navigate collective hazards without the performance trade-offs inherent in traditional reactive constraints. We evaluate Co2PO across a suite of complex multi-agent safety benchmarks, where it achieves higher returns compared to leading constrained baselines while converging to cost-compliant policies at deployment. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of risk-triggered communication, adaptive gating, and shared memory components.

Conclusion: 本工作首次为记忆化、相干性与遗忘之间的权衡提供了原则性理论解释，描绘了梯度基遗忘的稳定性边界，该边界依赖于批处理策略、数据混合方式以及数据/模型对齐程度。

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the ability to erase the effect of specific training samples without retraining from scratch, is critical for privacy, regulation, and efficiency. However, most progress in unlearning has been empirical, with little theoretical understanding of when and why unlearning works. We tackle this gap by framing unlearning through the lens of asymptotic linear stability to capture the interaction between optimization dynamics and data geometry. The key quantity in our analysis is data coherence which is the cross sample alignment of loss surface directions near the optimum. We decompose coherence along three axes: within the retain set, within the forget set, and between them, and prove tight stability thresholds that separate convergence from divergence. To further link data properties to forgettability, we study a two layer ReLU CNN under a signal plus noise model and show that stronger memorization makes forgetting easier: when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is lower, cross sample alignment is weaker, reducing coherence and making unlearning easier; conversely, high SNR, highly aligned models resist unlearning. For empirical verification, we show that Hessian tests and CNN heatmaps align closely with the predicted boundary, mapping the stability frontier of gradient based unlearning as a function of batching, mixing, and data/model alignment. Our analysis is grounded in random matrix theory tools and provides the first principled account of the trade offs between memorization, coherence, and unlearning.

Conclusion: 诊断条件监督可作为反馈型证明器的互补训练信号，APRIL数据集为定理证明领域的容错学习提供了关键基础设施

Abstract: As neural theorem provers become increasingly agentic, the ability to interpret and act on compiler feedback is critical. However, existing Lean datasets consist almost exclusively of correct proofs, offering little supervision for understanding and repairing failures. We study Lean proof repair as a supervised learning problem: given an erroneous proof and compiler feedback, predict both a corrected proof and a natural-language diagnosis grounded in the same feedback. We introduce APRIL (Automated Proof Repair in Lean), a dataset of 260,000 supervised tuples pairing systematically generated proof failures with compiler diagnostics and aligned repair and explanation targets. Training language models on APRIL substantially improves repair accuracy and feedback-conditioned reasoning; in our single-shot repair evaluation setting, a finetuned 4B-parameter model outperforms the strongest open-source baseline. We view diagnostic-conditioned supervision as a complementary training signal for feedback-using provers. Our dataset is available at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/uw-math-ai/APRIL}{this link}.

TL;DR: This paper extends gradient noise scale (GNS) based adaptive batch size strategies to non-Euclidean optimizers (signSGD and specSGD) by deriving noise scales from their dual norm geometries, achieving up to 66% reduction in training steps for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern ML systems rely on brittle, manually-tuned batch size heuristics. While GNS-based adaptive strategies exist, they assume Euclidean geometry, which doesn't match popular non-Euclidean optimizers like signSGD and specSGD, creating a fundamental mismatch.

Method: Derive gradient noise scales for signSGD and specSGD from their dual norm geometries (ℓ∞ and S∞ respectively), and propose an efficient variance estimation procedure that leverages local mini-batch gradients across different ranks in distributed data-parallel training.

Result: The non-Euclidean GNS adaptive batch size strategies match the validation loss of constant-batch baselines while reducing training steps by up to 66% for Signum and Muon optimizers on a 160 million parameter Llama model.

Conclusion: The work successfully extends adaptive batch size tuning to non-Euclidean optimizers, providing a principled and efficient alternative to heuristic tuning that significantly accelerates training without sacrificing model quality.

Abstract: To maximize hardware utilization, modern machine learning systems typically employ large constant or manually tuned batch size schedules, relying on heuristics that are brittle and costly to tune. Existing adaptive strategies based on gradient noise scale (GNS) offer a principled alternative. However, their assumption of SGD's Euclidean geometry creates a fundamental mismatch with popular optimizers based on generalized norms, such as signSGD / Signum ($\ell_\infty$) and stochastic spectral descent (specSGD) / Muon ($\mathcal{S}_\infty$). In this work, we derive gradient noise scales for signSGD and specSGD that naturally emerge from the geometry of their respective dual norms. To practically estimate these non-Euclidean metrics, we propose an efficient variance estimation procedure that leverages the local mini-batch gradients on different ranks in distributed data-parallel systems. Our experiments demonstrate that adaptive batch size strategies using non-Euclidean GNS enable us to match the validation loss of constant-batch baselines while reducing training steps by up to 66% for Signum and Muon on a 160 million parameter Llama model.

Motivation: 异常检测虽广泛应用，但缺乏标记异常样本严重阻碍了新任务上的有效部署，使得算法和超参数选择异常困难。

Method: 在FoMo-0D基础上引入混合合成先验和自进化课程训练，仅使用合成标记数据集预训练，通过将训练数据作为上下文输入进行零样本推理。

Conclusion: OUTFORMER通过上下文学习消除了对标记异常样本和额外训练的需求，实现了真正的即插即用异常检测部署。

Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) is widely used in practice; but its effective deployment on new tasks is hindered by lack of labeled outliers, which makes algorithm and hyperparameter selection notoriously hard. Foundation models (FMs) have transformed ML, and OD is no exception: Shen et. al. (2025) introduced FoMo-0D, the first FM for OD, achieving remarkable performance against numerous baselines. This work introduces OUTFORMER, which advances FoMo-0D with (1) a mixture of synthetic priors and (2) self-evolving curriculum training. OUTFORMER is pretrained solely on synthetic labeled datasets and infers test labels of a new task by using its training data as in-context input. Inference is fast and zero-shot, requiring merely forward pass and no labeled outliers. Thanks to in-context learning, it requires zero additional work-no OD model training or bespoke model selection-enabling truly plug-and-play deployment. OUTFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the prominent AdBench, as well as two new large-scale OD benchmarks that we introduce, comprising over 1,500 datasets, while maintaining speedy inference.

Motivation: 联邦学习微调大语言模型面临通信和计算开销大的挑战，现有参数高效微调方法虽降低成本但牺牲性能，需要兼顾效率和性能的解决方案。

Method: FedKRSO让客户端在服务器生成的共享随机低维子空间内更新模型，每轮只发送子空间上的模型更新累加器而非完整参数，实现高效聚合。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，FedKRSO在多种联邦场景下实现了与全参数微调接近的性能，同时大幅降低了通信和内存开销。

Conclusion: FedKRSO为资源受限边缘设备上的联邦大语言模型微调提供了可行路径，理论上可收敛，实验上验证了高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is essential to adapt general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to domain-specific tasks. As a privacy-preserving framework to leverage decentralized data for collaborative model training, Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity in LLM fine-tuning, but remains challenging due to the high cost of transmitting full model parameters and computing full gradients on resource-constrained clients. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used in FL to reduce communication and memory costs, they often sacrifice model performance compared to FFT. This paper proposes FedKRSO (Federated $K$-Seed Random Subspace Optimization), a novel method that enables communication and memory efficient FFT of LLMs in federated settings. In FedKRSO, clients update the model within a shared set of random low-dimension subspaces generated by the server to save memory usage. Furthermore, instead of transmitting full model parameters in each FL round, clients send only the model update accumulators along the subspaces to the server, enabling efficient global model aggregation and dissemination. By using these strategies, FedKRSO can substantially reduce communication and memory overhead while overcoming the performance limitations of PEFT, closely approximating the performance of federated FFT. The convergence properties of FedKRSO are analyzed rigorously under general FL settings. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark across diverse FL scenarios demonstrate that FedKRSO achieves both superior performance and low communication and memory overhead, paving the way towards on federated LLM fine-tuning at the resource-constrained edge.

TL;DR: ProCAD是一个主动澄清的文本到CAD生成框架，通过澄清智能体在代码生成前解决规格问题，性能显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到CAD系统难以处理用户描述不完整或矛盾的情况，导致模型虚构尺寸。需要一种在代码合成前主动解决规格问题的方法。

Method: 提出ProCAD框架，包含主动澄清智能体（审计提示并针对性提问）和CAD编码智能体（生成CadQuery代码）。编码智能体在高质量数据集上微调，澄清智能体通过智能体监督微调训练。

Result: 主动澄清显著提升了对模糊提示的鲁棒性且交互开销低。ProCAD相比Claude Sonnet 4.5，平均Chamfer距离降低79.9%，无效比率从4.8%降至0.9%。

Conclusion: ProCAD为文本到CAD生成提供了鲁棒性解决方案，代码和数据将公开可用。

Abstract: Large language models have recently enabled text-to-CAD systems that synthesize parametric CAD programs (e.g., CadQuery) from natural language prompts. In practice, however, geometric descriptions can be under-specified or internally inconsistent: critical dimensions may be missing and constraints may conflict. Existing fine-tuned models tend to reactively follow user instructions and hallucinate dimensions when the text is ambiguous. To address this, we propose a proactive agentic framework for text-to-CadQuery generation, named ProCAD, that resolves specification issues before code synthesis. Our framework pairs a proactive clarifying agent, which audits the prompt and asks targeted clarification questions only when necessary to produce a self-consistent specification, with a CAD coding agent that translates the specification into an executable CadQuery program. We fine-tune the coding agent on a curated high-quality text-to-CadQuery dataset and train the clarifying agent via agentic SFT on clarification trajectories. Experiments show that proactive clarification significantly improves robustness to ambiguous prompts while keeping interaction overhead low. ProCAD outperforms frontier closed-source models, including Claude Sonnet 4.5, reducing the mean Chamfer distance by 79.9 percent and lowering the invalidity ratio from 4.8 percent to 0.9 percent. Our code and datasets will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 量化样本训练价值并优化预算分配是提升LLM后训练效率的核心，为强化学习资源分配提供了新范式

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key approach for enhancing LLM reasoning.However, standard frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) typically employ a uniform rollout budget, leading to resource inefficiency. Moreover, existing adaptive methods often rely on instance-level metrics, such as task pass rates, failing to capture the model's dynamic learning state. To address these limitations, we propose CoBA-RL, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to adaptively allocate rollout budgets based on the model's evolving capability. Specifically, CoBA-RL utilizes a Capability-Oriented Value function to map tasks to their potential training gains and employs a heap-based greedy strategy to efficiently self-calibrate the distribution of computational resources to samples with high training value. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively orchestrates the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, delivering consistent generalization improvements across multiple challenging benchmarks. These findings underscore that quantifying sample training value and optimizing budget allocation are pivotal for advancing LLM post-training efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出FlashSinkhorn，一种面向大规模熵最优传输问题的IO感知GPU求解器。通过将稳定化对数域Sinkhorn迭代重构为类似Transformer注意力的行向LogSumExp归约形式，实现了FlashAttention风格的算子融合与分块计算，在A100 GPU上相比现有最优方法获得高达32倍前向传播加速和161倍端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 熵最优传输(EOT)在现代机器学习中应用广泛，但GPU求解器难以扩展到大规模问题。现有张量化实现因密集的n×m交互导致二次方HBM带宽开销，而在线计算后端虽避免存储密集矩阵，却仍依赖通用分块归约内核，算子融合能力有限，无法充分利用GPU内存层次结构。

Method: 针对平方欧氏代价，FlashSinkhorn将稳定化对数域Sinkhorn更新重写为带偏置的点积分数的行向LogSumExp归约，其计算模式与Transformer注意力归一化完全相同。基于此，设计融合Triton内核，采用FlashAttention式分块策略，将数据分块流式传输至片上SRAM，在单次遍历中完成对偶势能更新，显著降低每次迭代的HBM IO。同时提供用于传输矩阵应用的流式内核，支持可扩展的一阶和二阶优化算法。

Result: 在A100 GPU上的实验表明，FlashSinkhorn在点云最优传输任务中相比现有最先进的在线计算基线，前向传播速度提升高达32倍，端到端性能提升高达161倍，并在基于最优传输的下游任务中展现出更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: FlashSinkhorn通过算法重构与硬件感知的算子设计，有效解决了大规模最优传输计算的IO瓶颈问题，为机器学习应用提供了高效、可扩展的OT求解基础架构。

Abstract: Entropic optimal transport (EOT) via Sinkhorn iterations is widely used in modern machine learning, yet GPU solvers remain inefficient at scale. Tensorized implementations suffer quadratic HBM traffic from dense $n\times m$ interactions, while existing online backends avoid storing dense matrices but still rely on generic tiled map-reduce reduction kernels with limited fusion. We present \textbf{FlashSinkhorn}, an IO-aware EOT solver for squared Euclidean cost that rewrites stabilized log-domain Sinkhorn updates as row-wise LogSumExp reductions of biased dot-product scores, the same normalization as transformer attention. This enables FlashAttention-style fusion and tiling: fused Triton kernels stream tiles through on-chip SRAM and update dual potentials in a single pass, substantially reducing HBM IO per iteration while retaining linear-memory operations. We further provide streaming kernels for transport application, enabling scalable first- and second-order optimization. On A100 GPUs, FlashSinkhorn achieves up to $32\times$ forward-pass and $161\times$ end-to-end speedups over state-of-the-art online baselines on point-cloud OT, improves scalability on OT-based downstream tasks. For reproducibility, we release an open-source implementation at https://github.com/ot-triton-lab/ot_triton.

TL;DR: A unified geometry-aware neural architecture framework that interleaves geometric updates (projections/exponential maps) as discretizations of manifold dynamical systems, establishing universal approximation for constrained neural ODEs and enabling data-driven projection learning via diffusion when constraints are unknown, with experiments on S^2, SO(3), and S^{d-1} showing exact feasibility and strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving geometric structure is critical in learning tasks involving manifold-valued data. Current methods often fail to maintain geometric constraints throughout network layers, leading to potentially invalid or suboptimal representations that violate underlying geometric properties essential for accurate modeling.

Method: Proposes a unified class of geometry-aware architectures that interleave geometric updates between layers. These include projection layers and intrinsic exponential map operations, both derived as discretizations of projected dynamical systems on manifolds (with or without boundary). For unknown constraint sets, learns projections via small-time heat-kernel limits, enabling diffusion/flow-matching as data-based projections.

Result: Establishes universal approximation results for constrained neural ODEs within the framework. Proves a separate universal approximation property for architectures enforcing geometry only at output, enabling direct comparison with interleaved designs. Experiments on dynamics over S² and SO(3), and diffusion on S^{d-1}-valued features demonstrate exact feasibility for analytic updates and strong performance for learned projections.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully integrates geometric structure preservation into neural network architectures through interleaved updates, with strong theoretical guarantees and empirical performance across various manifolds, demonstrating both the feasibility of analytic updates and the effectiveness of data-driven projection learning.

Abstract: The Homotopy paradigm, a general principle for solving challenging problems, appears across diverse domains such as robust optimization, global optimization, polynomial root-finding, and sampling. Practical solvers for these problems typically follow a predictor-corrector (PC) structure, but rely on hand-crafted heuristics for step sizes and iteration termination, which are often suboptimal and task-specific. To address this, we unify these problems under a single framework, which enables the design of a general neural solver. Building on this unified view, we propose Neural Predictor-Corrector (NPC), which replaces hand-crafted heuristics with automatically learned policies. NPC formulates policy selection as a sequential decision-making problem and leverages reinforcement learning to automatically discover efficient strategies. To further enhance generalization, we introduce an amortized training mechanism, enabling one-time offline training for a class of problems and efficient online inference on new instances. Experiments on four representative homotopy problems demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively to unseen instances. It consistently outperforms classical and specialized baselines in efficiency while demonstrating superior stability across tasks, highlighting the value of unifying homotopy methods into a single neural framework.

TL;DR: TextME is a text-only framework for expanding multimodal representations to new modalities without paired datasets, using LLM embedding space as anchor to enable zero-shot cross-modal transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale paired datasets are costly and infeasible for expert domains like medical imaging and molecular analysis, limiting multimodal representation expansion.

Method: Projects diverse modalities into LLM embedding space as unified anchor, exploiting geometric structure of pretrained contrastive encoders for zero-shot cross-modal transfer using only text descriptions.

Result: Validated consistent modality gaps across multiple domains (image, video, audio, 3D, X-ray, molecular); text-only training preserves substantial pretrained encoder performance; enables emergent cross-modal retrieval between unseen modality pairs.

Conclusion: Text-only training provides a practical alternative to paired supervision for modality expansion.

Abstract: Expanding multimodal representations to novel modalities is constrained by reliance on large-scale paired datasets (e.g., text-image, text-audio, text-3D, text-molecule), which are costly and often infeasible in domains requiring expert annotation such as medical imaging and molecular analysis. We introduce TextME, the first text-only modality expansion framework, to the best of our knowledge, projecting diverse modalities into LLM embedding space as a unified anchor. Our approach exploits the geometric structure of pretrained contrastive encoders to enable zero-shot cross-modal transfer using only text descriptions, without paired supervision. We empirically validate that such consistent modality gaps exist across image, video, audio, 3D, X-ray, and molecular domains, demonstrating that text-only training can preserve substantial performance of pretrained encoders. We further show that our framework enables emergent cross-modal retrieval between modality pairs not explicitly aligned during training (e.g., audio-to-image, 3D-to-image). These results establish text-only training as a practical alternative to paired supervision for modality expansion.

Conclusion: C-GRPO成功将MBR解码的训练目标蒸馏到策略中，消除了推理时的高计算成本，为高效文本生成提供了无需参考的新范式

Abstract: Many strong decoding methods for text generation follow a sample-and-rerank paradigm: they draw multiple candidates, score each under a utility (reward) function using consensus across samples, and return the best one. Although effective, these methods incur high computational costs during inference due to repeated sampling and scoring. Prior attempts to amortize inference-time computation typically rely on gold references, teacher labels, or curated preference data, increasing dataset construction effort and the demand for high-fidelity reward models. We propose Consensus Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), which distills Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding into training by formulating the consensus utility as a group-relative objective within GRPO. C-GRPO requires only a utility function and policy samples, without gold references or explicit preference labels. Under ideal conditions, we show that the objective function of C-GRPO is directionally aligned with the gradient of the expected-utility objective underlying MBR decoding, leading to a convergence guarantee. Experiments on machine translation (WMT 2024) and text summarization (XSum) demonstrate that C-GRPO successfully achieves performance comparable to MBR decoding without the associated inference-time overhead, while outperforming reference-free baseline methods.

Abstract: Bayesian deep learning (BDL) provides a principled framework for reliable uncertainty quantification by combining deep neural networks with Bayesian inference. A central challenge in BDL lies in the design of informative prior distributions that scale effectively to high-dimensional data. Recent functional variational inference (VI) approaches address this issue by imposing priors directly in function space; however, most existing methods rely on Gaussian process (GP) priors, whose expressiveness and generalisation capabilities become limited in high-dimensional regimes. In this work, we propose VLM-FS-EB, a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework, leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs) to generates semantically meaningful context points. These synthetic samples are then used VLMs for embeddings to construct expressive functional priors. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various baselines, and experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves predictive performance and yields more reliable uncertainty estimates, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection tasks and data-scarce regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练后量化(PTQ)虽能压缩大模型以适应内存受限设备，但导致模型静态化且难以微调。标准微调依赖反向传播和高精度权重，无法应用于离散不可微的量化参数空间；现有进化策略(ES)虽无需反向传播，但在量化空间中仍因梯度消失或不准确而失败。

Method: 提出Quantized Evolution Strategies (QES)：1) 集成累积误差反馈机制保留高精度梯度信号；2) 采用无状态种子重放技术将内存消耗降至低精度推理水平，实现量化空间内的全参数微调。

Result: 在算术推理任务上显著优于最先进的零阶微调方法，首次实现量化模型直接微调，性能大幅提升。

Conclusion: QES开辟了在量化空间内完全扩展大语言模型的新可能，为资源受限设备上的模型优化提供了可行范式。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on memory-constrained devices, yet it renders models static and difficult to fine-tune. Standard fine-tuning paradigms, including Reinforcement Learning (RL), fundamentally rely on backpropagation and high-precision weights to compute gradients. Thus they cannot be used on quantized models, where the parameter space is discrete and non-differentiable. While Evolution Strategies (ES) offer a backpropagation-free alternative, optimization of the quantized parameters can still fail due to vanishing or inaccurate gradient. This paper introduces Quantized Evolution Strategies (QES), an optimization paradigm that performs full-parameter fine-tuning directly in the quantized space. QES is based on two innovations: (1) it integrates accumulated error feedback to preserve high-precision gradient signals, and (2) it utilizes a stateless seed replay to reduce memory usage to low-precision inference levels. QES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zeroth-order fine-tuning method on arithmetic reasoning tasks, making direct fine-tuning for quantized models possible. It therefore opens up the possibility for scaling up LLMs entirely in the quantized space. The source code is available at https://github.com/dibbla/Quantized-Evolution-Strategies .

*Timothee Leleu,Sudeera Gunathilaka,Federico Ghimenti,Surya Ganguli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS), a method that extracts hierarchical concept representations from LLM-generated programs and uses contrastive learning to guide algorithm discovery, improving efficiency and interpretability on combinatorics problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLM-assisted algorithm discovery shows promise, it's unclear how to maximally exploit the LLM's internal representation of program space to improve performance beyond using just algorithm lineage.

Method: CCTS extracts hierarchical concept trees from generated programs, learns a contrastive concept model that reweights parent selection using likelihood-ratio scores between high- and low-performing solutions, biasing search toward useful concept combinations while avoiding misleading ones.

Result: CCTS improves search efficiency over fitness-based baselines, produces interpretable task-specific concept trees across Erdős-type combinatorics problems, with gains primarily driven by learning which concepts to avoid, validated in synthetic environments.

Conclusion: Explicit concept hierarchy guidance via CCTS provides a more effective and interpretable approach to LLM-assisted algorithm discovery compared to lineage-based methods.

Abstract: Large language Model (LLM)-assisted algorithm discovery is an iterative, black-box optimization process over programs to approximatively solve a target task, where an LLM proposes candidate programs and an external evaluator provides task feedback. Despite intense recent research on the topic and promising results, how can the LLM internal representation of the space of possible programs be maximally exploited to improve performance is an open question. Here, we introduce Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS), which extracts a hierarchical concept representation from the generated programs and learns a contrastive concept model that guides parent selection. By reweighting parents using a likelihood-ratio score between high- and low-performing solutions, CCTS biases search toward useful concept combinations and away from misleading ones, providing guidance through an explicit concept hierarchy rather than the algorithm lineage constructed by the LLM. We show that CCTS improves search efficiency over fitness-based baselines and produces interpretable, task-specific concept trees across a benchmark of open Erdős-type combinatorics problems. Our analysis indicates that the gains are driven largely by learning which concepts to avoid. We further validate these findings in a controlled synthetic algorithm-discovery environment, which reproduces qualitatively the search dynamics observed with the LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统中，基础设施传感器或车辆上报的观测数据常因通信中断、传感器遮挡或联网车辆渗透率不足而不完整。可靠的交通密度重建对协同感知、预测路由和车路协同通信优化等关键应用至关重要，而现有矩阵补全方法在中高缺失率下表现不佳。

Method: 提出SATORIS-N框架，基于交通密度矩阵在不同日期具有低秩性和稳定奇异向量子空间的特性，设计显式融入先验奇异子空间信息的子空间感知SDP核范数模型。该凸优化公式同时强制低秩性和子空间对齐，保证全局最优解。同时研究了一种轻量级隐式子空间对齐策略，通过拼接连续日期的矩阵来鼓励时空奇异方向对齐。

Result: 在北京和上海两个真实数据集上的实验表明，SATORIS-N在中高遮挡率下持续优于SoftImpute、IterativeSVD、统计方法乃至深度学习基线。显式SDP方法在大比例数据缺失时表现出显著更强的鲁棒性，而隐式策略仅在低缺失率时提供 modest 提升。

Conclusion: SATORIS-N框架通过显式利用子空间先验信息，为智能交通系统提供了可靠的交通密度重建方案，特别适用于高缺失率场景。该方法可推广到其他奇异子空间随时间缓慢演化的时空设置，为自动驾驶导航的安全性和效率提供了关键技术支持。

Abstract: Traffic-density matrices from different days exhibit both low rank and stable correlations in their singular-vector subspaces. Leveraging this, we introduce SATORIS-N, a framework for imputing partially observed traffic-density by informed subspace priors from neighboring days. Our contribution is a subspace-aware semidefinite programming (SDP)} formulation of nuclear norm that explicitly informs the reconstruction with prior singular-subspace information. This convex formulation jointly enforces low rank and subspace alignment, providing a single global optimum and substantially improving accuracy under medium and high occlusion. We also study a lightweight implicit subspace-alignment} strategy in which matrices from consecutive days are concatenated to encourage alignment of spatial or temporal singular directions. Although this heuristic offers modest gains when missing rates are low, the explicit SDP approach is markedly more robust when large fractions of entries are missing. Across two real-world datasets (Beijing and Shanghai), SATORIS-N consistently outperforms standard matrix-completion methods such as SoftImpute, IterativeSVD, statistical, and even deep learning baselines at high occlusion levels. The framework generalizes to other spatiotemporal settings in which singular subspaces evolve slowly over time. In the context of intelligent vehicles and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems, accurate traffic-density
  reconstruction enables critical applications including cooperative perception, predictive routing, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication optimization. When infrastructure sensors or vehicle-reported observations are incomplete - due to communication dropouts, sensor occlusions, or sparse connected vehicle penetration-reliable imputation becomes essential for safe and efficient autonomous navigation.

Motivation: 在稀疏终端奖励场景下，GRPO算法的组内采样常获得相同奖励，导致相对优势计算失效、策略更新停滞，严重影响大语言模型对齐效果。

Method: 提出SAGE框架：为每个prompt自生成紧凑提示h（如计划或分解），在(x,h)条件下生成解法τ；保持终端奖励R(x,τ)不变，仅通过提示增加组内结果多样性来防止优势崩溃；测试时移除提示部署无特权策略；自提示采样形成自适应课程学习。

Result: 在6个基准测试、3个大语言模型上，SAGE平均性能显著超越GRPO：Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct提升+2.0，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct提升+1.2，Qwen3-4B-Instruct提升+1.3。

Conclusion: SAGE通过训练时注入自生成提示有效解决了稀疏奖励下GRPO的优势崩溃问题，无需测试时特权信息，实现了更稳定的策略优化和性能提升。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has recently emerged as a practical recipe for aligning large language models with verifiable objectives. However, under sparse terminal rewards, GRPO often stalls because rollouts within a group frequently receive identical rewards, causing relative advantages to collapse and updates to vanish. We propose self-hint aligned GRPO with privileged supervision (SAGE), an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that injects privileged hints during training to reshape the rollout distribution under the same terminal verifier reward. For each prompt $x$, the model samples a compact hint $h$ (e.g., a plan or decomposition) and then generates a solution $τ$ conditioned on $(x,h)$. Crucially, the task reward $R(x,τ)$ is unchanged; hints only increase within-group outcome diversity under finite sampling, preventing GRPO advantages from collapsing under sparse rewards. At test time, we set $h=\varnothing$ and deploy the no-hint policy without any privileged information. Moreover, sampling diverse self-hints serves as an adaptive curriculum that tracks the learner's bottlenecks more effectively than fixed hints from an initial policy or a stronger external model. Experiments over 6 benchmarks with 3 LLMs show that SAGE consistently outperforms GRPO, on average +2.0 on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, +1.2 on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +1.3 on Qwen3-4B-Instruct.

Conclusion: MemCast通过经验条件化推理和层次化记忆机制，为时间序列预测提供了具有持续进化能力的新范式，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a critical role in decision-making for many real-world applications. Recently, LLM-based forecasters have made promising advancements. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods often lack explicit experience accumulation and continual evolution. In this work, we propose MemCast, a learning-to-memory framework that reformulates TSF as an experience-conditioned reasoning task. Specifically, we learn experience from the training set and organize it into a hierarchical memory. This is achieved by summarizing prediction results into historical patterns, distilling inference trajectories into reasoning wisdom, and inducing extracted temporal features into general laws. Furthermore, during inference, we leverage historical patterns to guide the reasoning process and utilize reasoning wisdom to select better trajectories, while general laws serve as criteria for reflective iteration. Additionally, to enable continual evolution, we design a dynamic confidence adaptation strategy that updates the confidence of individual entries without leaking the test set distribution. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that MemCast consistently outperforms previous methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: PRM成功桥接行为经济学与强化学习，为需要快速策略适应的真实世界应用提供了新范式，在机器人、金融和自适应教育等领域具有广阔应用前景

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from slow convergence due to sparse reward signals, particularly in complex environments where feedback is delayed or infrequent. This paper introduces the Psychological Regret Model (PRM), a novel approach that accelerates learning by incorporating regret-based feedback signals after each decision step. Rather than waiting for terminal rewards, PRM computes a regret signal based on the difference between the expected value of the optimal action and the value of the action taken in each state. This transforms sparse rewards into dense feedback signals through a step-wise scoring framework, enabling faster convergence. We demonstrate that PRM achieves stable performance approximately 36\% faster than traditional Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in benchmark environments such as Lunar Lander. Our results indicate that PRM is particularly effective in continuous control tasks and environments with delayed feedback, making it suitable for real-world applications such as robotics, finance, and adaptive education where rapid policy adaptation is critical. The approach formalizes human-inspired counterfactual thinking as a computable regret signal, bridging behavioral economics and reinforcement learning.

### [232] [DynSplit-KV: Dynamic Semantic Splitting for KVCache Compression in Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03184)
*Jiancai Ye,Jun Liu,Qingchen Li,Tianlang Zhao,Hanbin Zhang,Jiayi Pan,Ningyi Xu,Guohao Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DynSplit-KV, a dynamic KV cache compression method that uses importance-aware delimiter selection and uniform mapping to achieve better accuracy and efficiency than rigid splitting methods, with 2.2x speedup and 2.6x memory reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache memory footprint is a bottleneck in long-context LLM inference. Current rigid splitting compression methods cause significant accuracy degradation (5.5-55.1%) because they don't adapt to scenario-dependent semantic boundaries.

Method: DynSplit-KV dynamically identifies semantic delimiters using an importance-aware strategy, then uniformly maps variable-length semantic blocks to fixed-length format to reduce overhead.

Result: Achieves 49.9% accuracy improvement over baseline, 4.9x inference overhead reduction, 2.2x speedup vs FlashAttention, and 2.6x peak memory reduction in long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: Dynamic semantic splitting is essential for effective KV cache compression, and DynSplit-KV successfully balances accuracy and efficiency by addressing both delimiter selection and block length variability challenges.

Abstract: Although Key-Value (KV) Cache is essential for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference, its growing memory footprint in long-context scenarios poses a significant bottleneck, making KVCache compression crucial. Current compression methods rely on rigid splitting strategies, such as fixed intervals or pre-defined delimiters. We observe that rigid splitting suffers from significant accuracy degradation (ranging from 5.5% to 55.1%) across different scenarios, owing to the scenario-dependent nature of the semantic boundaries. This highlights the necessity of dynamic semantic splitting to match semantics. To achieve this, we face two challenges. (1) Improper delimiter selection misaligns semantics with the KVCache, resulting in 28.6% accuracy loss. (2) Variable-length blocks after splitting introduce over 73.1% additional inference overhead. To address the above challenges, we propose DynSplit-KV, a KVCache compression method that dynamically identifies delimiters for splitting. We propose: (1) a dynamic importance-aware delimiter selection strategy, improving accuracy by 49.9%. (2) A uniform mapping strategy that transforms variable-length semantic blocks into a fixed-length format, reducing inference overhead by 4.9x. Experiments show that DynSplit-KV achieves the highest accuracy, 2.2x speedup compared with FlashAttention and 2.6x peak memory reduction in long-context scenarios.

*Wenquan Lu,Hai Huang,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes prompt augmentation to overcome entropy collapse in GRPO training for LLM math reasoning, enabling stable long-horizon training and achieving SOTA results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse during reinforcement post-training, forcing short training horizons (5-20 epochs) and limiting sustained exploration. Prior work also relies on a single, fixed reasoning prompt, reducing diversity.

Method: Introduces prompt augmentation - a training strategy that instructs the model to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates and formats. This increases rollout diversity and enables stable training without KL regularization, allowing tolerance of low-entropy regimes.

Result: A Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model trained with prompt augmentation on MATH Level 3-5 dataset achieves 44.5 per-benchmark accuracy and 51.3 per-question accuracy on AIME24, AMC, MATH500, Minerva, and OlympiadBench, reaching state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Prompt augmentation effectively mitigates entropy collapse, enabling stable scaling of training duration and significant improvement in mathematical reasoning capabilities without requiring KL regularization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms such as group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated strong potential for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, prior work has consistently observed an entropy collapse phenomenon during reinforcement post-training, characterized by a monotonic decrease in policy entropy that ultimately leads to training instability and collapse. As a result, most existing approaches restrict training to short horizons (typically 5-20 epochs), limiting sustained exploration and hindering further policy improvement. In addition, nearly all prior work relies on a single, fixed reasoning prompt or template during training. In this work, we introduce prompt augmentation, a training strategy that instructs the model to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates and formats, thereby increasing rollout diversity. We show that, without a KL regularization term, prompt augmentation enables stable scaling of training duration under a fixed dataset and allows the model to tolerate low-entropy regimes without premature collapse. Empirically, a Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model trained with prompt augmentation on the MATH Level 3-5 dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 44.5 per-benchmark accuracy and 51.3 per-question accuracy on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, Minerva, and OlympiadBench.

*Jing-Cheng Pang,Liang Lu,Xian Tang,Kun Jiang,Sijie Wu,Kai Zhang,Xubin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLPT is a framework that improves reinforcement learning for LLMs by constraining policy optimization to a dynamic set of promising tokens, reducing action space and improving training stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL approaches for LLMs operate over the full vocabulary space, including many contextually irrelevant tokens that distract the policy from focusing on truly reasonable decisions during optimization.

Method: RLPT leverages semantic priors from the base model to identify a dynamic set of promising tokens and constrains policy optimization exclusively to this refined subset via masking, decoupling strategic decision-making from token generation.

Result: The method reduces gradient variance, stabilizes training, and improves sample efficiency. It outperforms standard RL baselines on math, coding, and telecom reasoning tasks, and works effectively across model sizes (4B and 8B) and RL algorithms (GRPO and DAPO).

Conclusion: Constraining RL optimization to promising tokens effectively mitigates action space issues in LLM alignment, leading to better performance and training stability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key paradigm for aligning and optimizing large language models (LLMs). Standard approaches treat the LLM as the policy and apply RL directly over the full vocabulary space. However, this formulation includes the massive tail of contextually irrelevant tokens in the action space, which could distract the policy from focusing on decision-making among the truly reasonable tokens. In this work, we verify that valid reasoning paths could inherently concentrate within a low-rank subspace. Based on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Promising Tokens (RLPT), a framework that mitigates the action space issue by decoupling strategic decision-making from token generation. Specifically, RLPT leverages the semantic priors of the base model to identify a dynamic set of \emph{promising tokens} and constrains policy optimization exclusively to this refined subset via masking. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that RLPT effectively reduces gradient variance, stabilizes the training process, and improves sample efficiency. Experiment results on math, coding, and telecom reasoning show that RLPT outperforms standard RL baselines and integrates effectively across various model sizes (4B and 8B) and RL algorithms (GRPO and DAPO).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLOPE is an MBRL framework that replaces scalar reward prediction with optimistic potential landscape estimation to solve sparse reward problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MBRL fails in sparse reward settings because regressing ground-truth scalar rewards creates flat, gradient-free landscapes that lack directional guidance for planning.

Method: SLOPE uses optimistic distributional regression to construct informative potential landscapes by estimating high-confidence upper bounds, amplifying rare success signals to provide exploration gradients.

Result: Evaluated on 30+ tasks across 5 benchmarks, SLOPE consistently outperforms leading baselines across fully sparse, semi-sparse, and dense reward settings.

Conclusion: Shifting from scalar reward prediction to potential landscape modeling with optimistic estimates effectively addresses the sparse reward challenge in MBRL.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) achieves high sample efficiency by simulating future trajectories with learned dynamics and reward models. However, its effectiveness is severely compromised in sparse reward settings. The core limitation lies in the standard paradigm of regressing ground-truth scalar rewards: in sparse environments, this yields a flat, gradient-free landscape that fails to provide directional guidance for planning. To address this challenge, we propose Shaping Landscapes with Optimistic Potential Estimates (SLOPE), a novel framework that shifts reward modeling from predicting scalars to constructing informative potential landscapes. SLOPE employs optimistic distributional regression to estimate high-confidence upper bounds, which amplifies rare success signals and ensures sufficient exploration gradients. Evaluations on 30+ tasks across 5 benchmarks demonstrate that SLOPE consistently outperforms leading baselines in fully sparse, semi-sparse, and dense rewards.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel sampling method called LiDAR that computes expected future reward in diffusion models without neural backpropagation, achieving 9.5x speedup over gradient guidance while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models generate samples that often misalign with human intent, and existing gradient guidance methods are computationally expensive due to sequential neural backpropagation when approximating expected future reward (EFR).

Method: Proposes a new EFR formulation using only marginal samples from pre-trained diffusion models, which detaches neural dependency between intermediate state x_t and EFR for closed-form computation. Introduces lookahead sampling to collect marginal samples efficiently, and uses an accurate solver to guide particles toward high-reward lookahead samples.

Result: LiDAR achieves substantial performance improvements with just 3 samples and 3-step lookahead, showing steep gains as lookahead accuracy and sample count increase. It matches the latest gradient guidance method's GenEval performance for SDXL with a 9.5x speedup.

Conclusion: LiDAR sampling eliminates the computational bottleneck of gradient guidance methods while maintaining comparable performance, offering a highly efficient test-time scaling solution for improving human-aligned generation in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative performance; however, generated samples often fail to fully align with human intent. This paper studies a test-time scaling method that enables sampling from regions with higher human-aligned reward values. Existing gradient guidance methods approximate the expected future reward (EFR) at an intermediate particle $\mathbf{x}_t$ using a Taylor approximation, but this approximation at each time step incurs high computational cost due to sequential neural backpropagation. We show that the EFR at any $\mathbf{x}_t$ can be computed using only marginal samples from a pre-trained diffusion model. The proposed EFR formulation detaches the neural dependency between $\mathbf{x}_t$ and the EFR, enabling closed-form guidance computation without neural backpropagation. To further improve efficiency, we introduce lookahead sampling to collect marginal samples. For final sample generation, we use an accurate solver that guides particles toward high-reward lookahead samples. We refer to this sampling scheme as LiDAR sampling. LiDAR achieves substantial performance improvements using only three samples with a 3-step lookahead solver, exhibiting steep performance gains as lookahead accuracy and sample count increase; notably, it reaches the same GenEval performance as the latest gradient guidance method for SDXL with a 9.5x speedup.

Motivation: 理解局部相互作用如何产生全局大脑组织需要能够跨多尺度表示信息的模型。将通用图自监督学习应用于脑连接组数据时，可能存在与连接组拓扑特性的根本性错配问题，这促使作者构建可控基准测试来系统评估。

Result: 研究发现，基于不变性的SSL模型与基准的拓扑特性存在根本性错配，被经典拓扑感知启发式方法灾难性超越。SSL目标函数对拓扑扰动的追求使其学会忽略经典方法所利用的社区结构。

Conclusion: 该研究暴露了将通用图SSL应用于类连接组数据的根本性陷阱，强调神经AI研究需要新的拓扑感知SSL目标，这些目标应明确奖励结构保持（如模块性或模体）。

Abstract: Understanding how local interactions give rise to global brain organization requires models that can represent information across multiple scales. We introduce a hierarchical self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that jointly learns node-, edge-, and graph-level embeddings, inspired by multimodal neuroimaging. We construct a controllable synthetic benchmark mimicking the topological properties of connectomes. Our four-stage evaluation protocol reveals a critical failure: the invariance-based SSL model is fundamentally misaligned with the benchmark's topological properties and is catastrophically outperformed by classical, topology-aware heuristics. Ablations confirm an objective mismatch: SSL objectives designed to be invariant to topological perturbations learn to ignore the very community structure that classical methods exploit. Our results expose a fundamental pitfall in applying generic graph SSL to connectome-like data. We present this framework as a cautionary case study, highlighting the need for new, topology-aware SSL objectives for neuro-AI research that explicitly reward the preservation of structure (e.g., modularity or motifs).

TL;DR: The paper proposes Spectral Evolution Search (SES), a gradient-free evolutionary search method that optimizes initial noise for visual generative models within a low-frequency subspace, addressing spectral bias to achieve better efficiency and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time scaling methods that optimize high-dimensional initial noise are severely inefficient because many search directions have negligible impact on final generation, due to a spectral bias where model sensitivity to perturbations diminishes rapidly with increasing frequency.

Method: The authors propose Spectral Evolution Search (SES), a plug-and-play framework that performs gradient-free evolutionary search in a low-frequency subspace. They also derive a theoretical Spectral Scaling Prediction from perturbation propagation dynamics to explain frequency-dependent perturbation effects.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that SES significantly advances the Pareto frontier of generation quality versus computational cost, consistently outperforming strong baselines under equivalent computational budgets.

Conclusion: By exploiting spectral bias and searching in a low-frequency subspace, SES provides an efficient and effective approach for inference-time alignment of visual generative models, achieving superior quality-cost tradeoffs.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling offers a versatile paradigm for aligning visual generative models with downstream objectives without parameter updates. However, existing approaches that optimize the high-dimensional initial noise suffer from severe inefficiency, as many search directions exert negligible influence on the final generation. We show that this inefficiency is closely related to a spectral bias in generative dynamics: model sensitivity to initial perturbations diminishes rapidly as frequency increases. Building on this insight, we propose Spectral Evolution Search (SES), a plug-and-play framework for initial noise optimization that executes gradient-free evolutionary search within a low-frequency subspace. Theoretically, we derive the Spectral Scaling Prediction from perturbation propagation dynamics, which explains the systematic differences in the impact of perturbations across frequencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SES significantly advances the Pareto frontier of generation quality versus computational cost, consistently outperforming strong baselines under equivalent budgets.

Conclusion: GraDE框架有效平衡了计算可行性与发现能力，为神经架构分析提供了新范式。

Abstract: Finding frequently occurring subgraph patterns or network motifs in neural architectures is crucial for optimizing efficiency, accelerating design, and uncovering structural insights. However, as the subgraph size increases, enumeration-based methods are perfectly accurate but computationally prohibitive, while sampling-based methods are computationally tractable but suffer from a severe decline in discovery capability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes GraDE, a diffusion-guided search framework that ensures both computational feasibility and discovery capability. The key innovation is the Graph Diffusion Estimator (GraDE), which is the first to introduce graph diffusion models to identify frequent subgraphs by scoring their typicality within the learned distribution. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the estimator achieves superior ranking accuracy, with up to 114\% improvement compared to sampling-based baselines. Benefiting from this, the proposed framework successfully discovers large-scale frequent patterns, achieving up to 30$\times$ higher median frequency than sampling-based methods.

Abstract: Detecting toxicity in multimodal data remains a significant challenge, as harmful meanings often lurk beneath seemingly benign individual modalities: only emerging when modalities are combined and semantic associations are activated. To address this, we propose a novel detection framework based on Toxicity Association Graphs (TAGs), which systematically model semantic associations between innocuous entities and latent toxic implications. Leveraging TAGs, we introduce the first quantifiable metric for hidden toxicity, the Multimodal Toxicity Covertness (MTC), which measures the degree of concealment in toxic multimodal expressions. By integrating our detection framework with the MTC metric, our approach enables precise identification of covert toxicity while preserving full interpretability of the decision-making process, significantly enhancing transparency in multimodal toxicity detection. To validate our method, we construct the Covert Toxic Dataset, the first benchmark specifically designed to capture high-covertness toxic multimodal instances. This dataset encodes nuanced cross-modal associations and serves as a rigorous testbed for evaluating both the proposed metric and detection framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across both low- and high-covertness toxicity regimes, while delivering clear, interpretable, and auditable detection outcomes. Together, our contributions advance the state of the art in explainable multimodal toxicity detection and lay the foundation for future context-aware and interpretable approaches. Content Warning: This paper contains examples of toxic multimodal content that may be offensive or disturbing to some readers. Reader discretion is advised.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop effective data synthesis techniques that autonomously synthesize multimodal training data for enhancing MLLMs in solving complex real-world tasks. To this end, we propose Collective Adversarial Data Synthesis (CADS), a novel and general approach to synthesize high-quality, diverse and challenging multimodal data for MLLMs. The core idea of CADS is to leverage collective intelligence to ensure high-quality and diverse generation, while exploring adversarial learning to synthesize challenging samples for effectively driving model improvement. Specifically, CADS operates with two cyclic phases, i.e., Collective Adversarial Data Generation (CAD-Generate) and Collective Adversarial Data Judgment (CAD-Judge). CAD-Generate leverages collective knowledge to jointly generate new and diverse multimodal data, while CAD-Judge collaboratively assesses the quality of synthesized data. In addition, CADS introduces an Adversarial Context Optimization mechanism to optimize the generation context to encourage challenging and high-value data generation. With CADS, we construct MMSynthetic-20K and train our model R1-SyntheticVL, which demonstrates superior performance on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: 通过适当正则化投影算子，PRQ算法实现了在函数逼近下的稳定收敛，为强化学习中的这一基础问题提供了理论可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), Q-learning is a fundamental algorithm whose convergence is guaranteed in the tabular setting. However, this convergence guarantee does not hold under linear function approximation. To overcome this limitation, a significant line of research has introduced regularization techniques to ensure stable convergence under function approximation. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, periodic regularized Q-learning (PRQ). We first introduce regularization at the level of the projection operator and explicitly construct a regularized projected value iteration (RP-VI), subsequently extending it to a sample-based RL algorithm. By appropriately regularizing the projection operator, the resulting projected value iteration becomes a contraction. By extending this regularized projection into the stochastic setting, we establish the PRQ algorithm and provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that proves finite-time convergence guarantees for PRQ under linear function approximation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ARM（激活引导的旋转感知合并）的模型合并方法，通过将合并视为迭代优化过程，利用早期SFT检查点即可超越完全收敛的SFT模型性能，在1.7B到14B参数规模的模型上验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模不断扩大，需要高效的适应技术。现有模型合并技术通常作为事后优化或专注于缓解任务干扰，未能捕捉监督微调（SFT）的动态优化优势，因此需要一种能体现迭代优化过程的合并方法。

Method: 提出Streaming Merging新范式，将合并视为迭代优化过程。核心是ARM策略：将合并系数视为学习率，从激活子空间推导旋转向量，近似梯度下降动态；通过对齐语义子空间保持高维参数演化的几何结构；仅使用早期SFT检查点进行迭代合并。

Result: ARM在1.7B至14B参数规模的模型上，在数学、代码等多个领域超越了完全收敛的SFT模型性能，证明了该方法的可扩展性和轻量级特性。

Conclusion: ARM能够超越收敛的检查点，提供了一种可扩展且轻量级的模型适应框架，为高效模型更新开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The escalating scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient adaptation techniques. Model merging has gained prominence for its efficiency and controllability. However, existing merging techniques typically serve as post-hoc refinements or focus on mitigating task interference, often failing to capture the dynamic optimization benefits of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose Streaming Merging, an innovative model updating paradigm that conceptualizes merging as an iterative optimization process. Central to this paradigm is \textbf{ARM} (\textbf{A}ctivation-guided \textbf{R}otation-aware \textbf{M}erging), a strategy designed to approximate gradient descent dynamics. By treating merging coefficients as learning rates and deriving rotation vectors from activation subspaces, ARM effectively steers parameter updates along data-driven trajectories. Unlike conventional linear interpolation, ARM aligns semantic subspaces to preserve the geometric structure of high-dimensional parameter evolution. Remarkably, ARM requires only early SFT checkpoints and, through iterative merging, surpasses the fully converged SFT model. Experimental results across model scales (1.7B to 14B) and diverse domains (e.g., math, code) demonstrate that ARM can transcend converged checkpoints. Extensive experiments show that ARM provides a scalable and lightweight framework for efficient model adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出EGSPO框架，通过三阶段训练和熵门控梯度分配机制，在token级别动态混合SFT和RL，在数学推理基准测试上显著超越基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合训练方法仅在样本级别结合监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)，无法在token级别精细控制学习信号，导致探索不足或知识遗忘问题。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) SFT专家学习建立可靠初始策略；2) RL rollout生成并计算每个token的预测熵；3) EGSPO熵门控机制，高熵token采用完整PPO更新促进探索，低熵token采用衰减PPO更新降低方差并保留知识，两分支均使用优势函数防止强化置信错误。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试上，相比CHORD phi基线，AIME提升3.8个百分点，MATH提升2.9个百分点，仅增加3.4%计算开销。

Conclusion: EGSPO通过token级别的熵门控梯度调制，有效平衡了探索与知识保留，为混合训练提供了更精细的优化策略，实现了性能与效率的良好权衡。

Abstract: Hybrid training methods for large language models combine supervised fine tuning (SFT) on expert demonstrations with reinforcement learning (RL) on model rollouts, typically at the sample level. We propose Entropy Gated Selective Policy Optimization (EGSPO), a three stage framework that extends sample level mixing with token level gradient modulation.
  Stage 1, SFT expert learning, establishes a reliable warm up policy using expert demonstrations with a pure SFT loss. Stage 2, RL rollout generation, samples trajectories from the current policy and computes per token predictive entropy. Stage 3, the EGSPO mechanism, applies entropy gated gradient allocation: a predictive entropy module routes high entropy tokens to full PPO updates to encourage exploration, and low entropy tokens to attenuated PPO updates to reduce variance and preserve knowledge. Critically, both branches incorporate the advantage function A_t, ensuring that incorrect trajectories receive consistent negative learning signals and preventing reinforcement of confident errors.
  EGSPO achieves consistent improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with gains of 3.8 percent on AIME and 2.9 percent on MATH over the CHORD phi baseline, while incurring only 3.4 percent additional computational overhead.

### [245] [Robustness as an Emergent Property of Task Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03344)
*Shir Ashury-Tahan,Ariel Gera,Elron Bandel,Michal Shmueli-Scheuer,Leshem Choshen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that robustness emerges naturally as models achieve high performance on tasks, challenging the need for explicit robustness research and suggesting practitioners can trust models on easier tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses robustness as a critical challenge for real-world AI applications. It challenges the prevailing view that robustness is an independent capability requiring separate measurement and improvement, hypothesizing instead that robustness naturally emerges as models master tasks.

Method: The authors conduct an empirical analysis across multiple models, datasets, and experimental configurations including paraphrases and different temperatures to examine the relationship between task performance and robustness.

Result: They find a strong positive correlation between model performance and robustness, with robustness being primarily driven by task-specific competence rather than inherent model-level properties. This suggests robustness is a byproduct of task mastery.

Conclusion: The study concludes that as tasks become saturated with high performance, robustness naturally emerges. This implies researchers should reduce explicit robustness efforts, and practitioners can confidently deploy models on easier, well-solved tasks.

Abstract: Robustness is often regarded as a critical future challenge for real-world applications, where stability is essential. However, as models often learn tasks in a similar order, we hypothesize that easier tasks will be easier regardless of how they are presented to the model. Indeed, in this paper, we show that as models approach high performance on a task, robustness is effectively achieved. Through an empirical analysis of multiple models across diverse datasets and configurations (e.g., paraphrases, different temperatures), we find a strong positive correlation. Moreover, we find that robustness is primarily driven by task-specific competence rather than inherent model-level properties, challenging current approaches that treat robustness as an independent capability. Thus, from a high-level perspective, we may expect that as new tasks saturate, model robustness on these tasks will emerge accordingly. For researchers, this implies that explicit efforts to measure and improve robustness may warrant reduced emphasis, as such robustness is likely to develop alongside performance gains. For practitioners, it acts as a sign that indeed the tasks that the literature deals with are unreliable, but on easier past tasks, the models are reliable and ready for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究揭示了在LLM越狱攻击中，对抗性token的位置（前缀vs后缀）是一个被忽视的关键因素，影响攻击成功率，呼吁在安全评估中考虑token位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型广泛采用需要强大的安全对齐机制，但越狱攻击通过对抗性提示绕过对齐，现有研究主要关注后缀攻击，忽视了对抗性token位置这一攻击维度。

Method: 以Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG)攻击为案例，系统测试将对抗性token优化为前缀而非后缀，并在评估中变化token位置，分析对攻击成功率的影响。

Result: 实验表明，将对抗性token从后缀改为前缀，以及变化token位置，会显著影响攻击成功率，揭示当前安全评估中存在关键盲点。

Conclusion: 对抗性token位置是越狱攻击的重要维度，当前LLM安全评估未能充分考量这一点，未来必须将token位置纳入对抗鲁棒性评估框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption across multiple domains, creating an urgent need for robust safety alignment mechanisms. However, robustness remains challenging due to jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment via adversarial prompts. In this work, we focus on the prevalent Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack and identify a previously underexplored attack axis in jailbreak attacks typically framed as suffix-based: the placement of adversarial tokens within the prompt. Using GCG as a case study, we show that both optimizing attacks to generate prefixes instead of suffixes and varying adversarial token position during evaluation substantially influence attack success rates. Our findings highlight a critical blind spot in current safety evaluations and underline the need to account for the position of adversarial tokens in the adversarial robustness evaluation of LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架在保持准确性的同时，显著提升了因果图恢复的计算效率，为大规模因果发现提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework for recovering causal graphs from observational data, leveraging the observation that the distribution of an effect, conditioned on its causes, remains invariant to changes in the prior distribution of those causes. This insight enables a direct test for potential causal relationships by checking the variance of their corresponding effect-cause conditional distributions across multiple downsampled subsets of the data. These subsets are selected to reflect different prior cause distributions, while preserving the effect-cause conditional relationships. Using this invariance test and exploiting an (empirical) sparsity of most causal graphs, we develop an algorithm that efficiently uncovers causal relationships with quadratic complexity in the number of observational variables, reducing the processing time by up to 25x compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our empirical experiments on a varied benchmark of large-scale datasets show superior or equivalent performance compared to existing works, while achieving enhanced scalability.

TL;DR: MeKi是一种新型系统，它通过存储型内存专家而非计算密集型参数来扩展边缘设备的LLM容量，在实现更好性能的同时不增加延迟开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LLM扩展方法（增加参数/测试时计算）由于RAM和NPU资源有限，对于边缘设备不切实际，然而在智能手机等设备上部署高性能LLM对用户体验至关重要。

Method: 论文提出MeKi（基于内存的专家知识注入），为每个Transformer层配备标记级内存专家，注入预存储的语义知识。采用重参数化策略将训练参数折叠为紧凑的静态查找表，将知识卸载到ROM，实现模型容量与计算成本的解耦，推理延迟开销为零。

Result: 大量实验表明，MeKi在保持相同推理速度的同时，显著优于密集LLM基线。

Conclusion: 基于内存的扩展范式对于设备端LLM是有效的，成功实现了容量与计算成本的解耦。

Abstract: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) typically relies on increasing the number of parameters or test-time computations to boost performance. However, these strategies are impractical for edge device deployment due to limited RAM and NPU resources. Despite hardware constraints, deploying performant LLM on edge devices such as smartphone remains crucial for user experience. To address this, we propose MeKi (Memory-based Expert Knowledge Injection), a novel system that scales LLM capacity via storage space rather than FLOPs. MeKi equips each Transformer layer with token-level memory experts that injects pre-stored semantic knowledge into the generation process. To bridge the gap between training capacity and inference efficiency, we employ a re-parameterization strategy to fold parameter matrices used during training into a compact static lookup table. By offloading the knowledge to ROM, MeKi decouples model capacity from computational cost, introducing zero inference latency overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeKi significantly outperforms dense LLM baselines with identical inference speed, validating the effectiveness of memory-based scaling paradigm for on-device LLMs. Project homepage is at https://github.com/ningding-o/MeKi.

### [249] [BlockRR: A Unified Framework of RR-type Algorithms for Label Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03277)
*Haixia Liu,Yi Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We propose BlockRR, a unified randomized-response mechanism for label differential privacy that generalizes existing methods, provides theoretical guarantees, and achieves better accuracy-fairness trade-offs on imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing randomized-response mechanisms for label differential privacy lack a unified framework and require separate case-by-case analysis, while needing to handle class imbalance effectively under privacy constraints.

Method: BlockRR is a novel randomized-response mechanism that generalizes existing RR-type mechanisms through a partition method based on a weight matrix derived from label prior information, with parallel composition ensuring privacy guarantees are maintained.

Result: Experiments on imbalanced CIFAR-10 variants show BlockRR achieves better balance between test accuracy and average per-class accuracy in high/moderate privacy regimes (ε ≤ 3.0), and reduces to standard RR without performance loss in low privacy regimes (ε ≥ 4.0).

Conclusion: BlockRR provides a unified framework for label differential privacy that eliminates case-by-case analysis, maintains theoretical privacy guarantees, and offers improved performance on imbalanced data compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BlockRR, a novel and unified randomized-response mechanism for label differential privacy. This framework generalizes existed RR-type mechanisms as special cases under specific parameter settings, which eliminates the need for separate, case-by-case analysis. Theoretically, we prove that BlockRR satisfies $ε$-label DP. We also design a partition method for BlockRR based on a weight matrix derived from label prior information; the parallel composition principle ensures that the composition of two such mechanisms remains $ε$-label DP. Empirically, we evaluate BlockRR on two variants of CIFAR-10 with varying degrees of class imbalance. Results show that in the high-privacy and moderate-privacy regimes ($ε\leq 3.0$), our propsed method gets a better balance between test accuaracy and the average of per-class accuracy. In the low-privacy regime ($ε\geq 4.0$), all methods reduce BlockRR to standard RR without additional performance loss.

### [250] [Rethinking Benign Relearning: Syntax as the Hidden Driver of Unlearning Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03379)
*Sangyeon Yoon,Hyesoo Hong,Wonje Jeung,Albert No*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies syntactic similarity, not topical relevance, as the main cause of "benign relearning" in machine unlearning, and proposes syntactic diversification through paraphrasing to make unlearning more robust and effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods are fragile because forgotten information can reemerge during benign fine-tuning (benign relearning), and the common explanation of topical relevance is insufficient to fully account for this phenomenon.

Method: Through systematic analysis across benchmarks, the authors demonstrate that syntactic similarity drives relearning due to alignment in model representations and gradients. They propose syntactic diversification, which paraphrases forget queries into heterogeneous structures before unlearning.

Result: Syntactically similar data consistently triggers recovery of forgotten content even without topical overlap. The proposed syntactic diversification approach effectively suppresses benign relearning, accelerates forgetting, and reduces the trade-off between unlearning efficacy and model utility.

Conclusion: The fragility of current unlearning methods stems from syntactic patterns rather than semantic content, and addressing syntactic similarity through diversification offers a more robust solution for machine unlearning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific content from trained models while preserving overall performance. However, the phenomenon of benign relearning, in which forgotten information reemerges even from benign fine-tuning data, reveals that existing unlearning methods remain fundamentally fragile. A common explanation attributes this effect to topical relevance, but we find this account insufficient. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that syntactic similarity, rather than topicality, is the primary driver: across benchmarks, syntactically similar data consistently trigger recovery even without topical overlap, due to their alignment in representations and gradients with the forgotten content. Motivated by this insight, we introduce syntactic diversification, which paraphrases the original forget queries into heterogeneous structures prior to unlearning. This approach effectively suppresses benign relearning, accelerates forgetting, and substantially alleviates the trade-off between unlearning efficacy and model utility.

Method: 研究紧集上Hilbert空间乘积中连续泛函的通用逼近性，通过有限个连续线性测量、标量非线性函数和组合操作构造逼近模型，并推广到Banach空间值映射的有限秩逼近。

Result: 证明了任何此类连续泛函都能被"先进行有限线性测量，再通过标量非线性函数，最后组合"的模型一致逼近；并将结果扩展到Banach空间值映射，得到有限秩逼近。

Conclusion: 该结果为算子学习和成像中常见的设计模式提供了紧致集上的严格理论验证，确立了此类架构的数学有效性。

Abstract: We study universal approximation of continuous functionals on compact subsets of products of Hilbert spaces. We prove that any such functional can be uniformly approximated by models that first take finitely many continuous linear measurements of the inputs and then combine these measurements through continuous scalar nonlinearities. We also extend the approximation principle to maps with values in a Banach space, yielding finite-rank approximations. These results provide a compact-set justification for the common ``measure, apply scalar nonlinearities, then combine'' design pattern used in operator learning and imaging.

### [252] [An Approximate Ascent Approach To Prove Convergence of PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03386)
*Leif Doering,Daniel Schmidt,Moritz Melcher,Sebastian Kassing,Benedikt Wille,Tilman Aach,Simon Weissmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first convergence proof for PPO by interpreting its updates as approximated policy gradient ascent with controlled bias, and identifies/fixes a critical bias in truncated GAE that causes performance collapse at episode boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO is widely used but lacks theoretical understanding of its convergence and practical advantages; additionally, a fundamental flaw in its commonly used Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) component remains unaddressed.

Method: 1) Reformulates PPO's minibatch multi-epoch updates as biased policy gradient ascent using surrogate objectives; 2) Controls bias via random reshuffling analysis; 3) Proves convergence under standard assumptions; 4) Diagnoses geometric weighting flaw in truncated GAE causing infinite variance at episode boundaries.

Result: 1) Establishes convergence theorem explaining PPO's empirical success; 2) Discovers GAE's terminal-signal bias causing "infinite mass collapse" onto longest k-step estimators; 3) Empirical validation shows simple weight correction significantly improves Lunar Lander performance.

Conclusion: PPO's effectiveness stems from approximating policy gradient with bounded bias, and its performance can be further enhanced by correcting the overlooked GAE weighting scheme—resolving both theoretical and practical gaps in the algorithm.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is among the most widely used deep reinforcement learning algorithms, yet its theoretical foundations remain incomplete. Most importantly, convergence and understanding of fundamental PPO advantages remain widely open. Under standard theory assumptions we show how PPO's policy update scheme (performing multiple epochs of minibatch updates on multi-use rollouts with a surrogate gradient) can be interpreted as approximated policy gradient ascent. We show how to control the bias accumulated by the surrogate gradients and use techniques from random reshuffling to prove a convergence theorem for PPO that sheds light on PPO's success. Additionally, we identify a previously overlooked issue in truncated Generalized Advantage Estimation commonly used in PPO. The geometric weighting scheme induces infinite mass collapse onto the longest $k$-step advantage estimator at episode boundaries. Empirical evaluations show that a simple weight correction can yield substantial improvements in environments with strong terminal signal, such as Lunar Lander.

Method: MSDE框架采用加权均值漂移过程，利用UMAP构建的模糊邻域图计算自适应的样本特定密度权重，通过少量迭代后的累计位移作为异常分数。

Result: 在包含46个真实世界表格数据集、4种异常生成机制和6个噪声水平的ADBench基准上，MSDE在AUC-ROC、AUC-PR和Precision@n指标上相比13种基线方法表现出色且稳定。

Conclusion: 基于位移的评分机制为无监督异常检测提供了一种鲁棒的替代方案，能够应对不同类型的异常和噪声干扰。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection stands as an important problem in machine learning, with applications in financial fraud prevention, network security and medical diagnostics. Existing unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms rarely perform well across different anomaly types, often excelling only under specific structural assumptions. This lack of robustness also becomes particularly evident under noisy settings. We propose Mean Shift Density Enhancement (MSDE), a fully unsupervised framework that detects anomalies through their geometric response to density-driven manifold evolution. MSDE is based on the principle that normal samples, being well supported by local density, remain stable under iterative density enhancement, whereas anomalous samples undergo large cumulative displacements as they are attracted toward nearby density modes. To operationalize this idea, MSDE employs a weighted mean-shift procedure with adaptive, sample-specific density weights derived from a UMAP-based fuzzy neighborhood graph. Anomaly scores are defined by the total displacement accumulated across a small number of mean-shift iterations. We evaluate MSDE on the ADBench benchmark, comprising forty six real-world tabular datasets, four realistic anomaly generation mechanisms, and six noise levels. Compared to 13 established unsupervised baselines, MSDE achieves consistently strong, balanced and robust performance for AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, and Precision@n, at several noise levels and on average over several types of anomalies. These results demonstrate that displacement-based scoring provides a robust alternative to the existing state-of-the-art for unsupervised anomaly detection.

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上实现最高4.75倍加速，仅伴随轻微准确率下降。

Conclusion: 该方案有效平衡了计算效率与模型性能，为DEQ的实际应用提供了可行优化路径。

Abstract: Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) achieve infinitely deep network representations without stacking layers by exploring fixed points of layer transformations in neural networks. Such models constitute an innovative approach that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in many large-scale numerical experiments, despite requiring significantly less memory. However, DEQs face the challenge of requiring vastly more computational time for training and inference than conventional methods, as they repeatedly perform fixed-point iterations with no convergence guarantee upon each input. Therefore, this study explored an approach to improve fixed-point convergence and consequently reduce computational time by restructuring the model architecture to guarantee fixed-point convergence. Our proposed approach for image classification, Lipschitz multiscale DEQ, has theoretically guaranteed fixed-point convergence for both forward and backward passes by hyperparameter adjustment, achieving up to a 4.75$\times$ speed-up in numerical experiments on CIFAR-10 at the cost of a minor drop in accuracy.

Abstract: Entropy serves as a critical metric for measuring the diversity of outputs generated by large language models (LLMs), providing valuable insights into their exploration capabilities. While recent studies increasingly focus on monitoring and adjusting entropy to better balance exploration and exploitation in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a principled understanding of entropy dynamics during this process is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the entropy dynamics during the RFT process, which begins with a discriminant expression that quantifies entropy change under a single logit update. This foundation enables the derivation of a first-order expression for entropy change, which can be further extended to the update formula of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The corollaries and insights drawn from the theoretical analysis inspire the design of entropy control methods, and also offer a unified lens for interpreting various entropy-based methods in existing studies. We provide empirical evidence to support the main conclusions of our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived entropy-discriminator clipping methods. This study yields novel insights into RFT training dynamics, providing theoretical support and practical strategies for optimizing the exploration-exploitation balance during LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 双向信号机制提供更丰富的学习反馈，在提升样本效率的同时保持探索能力，实现了用极少量提示达到接近大规模训练的数学推理性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is effective for training large language models on deterministic outcome reasoning tasks. Prior work shows RLVR works with few prompts, but prompt selection is often based only on training-accuracy variance, leading to unstable optimization directions and weaker transfer. We revisit prompt selection from a mechanism-level view and argue that an effective minibatch should provide both (i) a reliable positive anchor and (ii) explicit negative learning signals from rare failures. Based on this principle, we propose \emph{positive--negative pairing}: at each update, we sample a hard-but-solvable $q^{+}$ and an easy-but-brittle prompt $q^{-}$(high success rate but not perfect), characterized by low and high empirical success rates under multiple rollouts. We further introduce Weighted GRPO, which reweights binary outcomes at the pair level and uses group-normalized advantages to amplify rare successes on $q^{+}$ into sharp positive guidance while turning rare failures on $q^{-}$ into strong negative penalties. This bidirectional signal provides informative learning feedback for both successes and failures, improving sample efficiency without suppressing exploration. On Qwen2.5-Math-7B, a single paired minibatch per update consistently outperforms a GRPO baseline that selects two prompts via commonly used variance-based selection heuristics: AIME~2025 Pass@8 improves from 16.8 to 22.2, and AMC23 Pass@64 from 94.0 to 97.0, while remaining competitive with large-scale RLVR trained from a pool of 1209 training prompts. Similar gains are observed on Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive generation for single-cell RNA-seq data suffers from artificial ordering bias and error accumulation due to the data's inherent high-dimensionality, sparsity, and unordered nature.

Method: Introduces continuous-time forward masking in token space to simulate biological dropout, a bidirectional denoiser jointly modeling discrete genes and continuous values via entropy-normalized serialization and latent anchor tokens, trained with depth-invariant sampling and dual denoising objectives.

Result: Pre-trained on 59 million cells, scDiVa demonstrates strong transfer learning performance across key tasks: batch integration, cell type annotation, and perturbation response prediction.

Conclusion: Masked discrete diffusion provides a biologically coherent and effective alternative to autoregressive generation for single-cell foundation models.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq profiles are high-dimensional, sparse, and unordered, causing autoregressive generation to impose an artificial ordering bias and suffer from error accumulation. To address this, we propose scDiVa, a masked discrete diffusion foundation model that aligns generation with the dropout-like corruption process by defining a continuous-time forward masking mechanism in token space. ScDiVa features a bidirectional denoiser that jointly models discrete gene identities and continuous values, utilizing entropy-normalized serialization and a latent anchor token to maximize information efficiency and preserve global cell identity. The model is trained via depth-invariant time sampling and a dual denoising objective to simulate varying sparsity levels while ensuring precise recovery of both identity and magnitude. Pre-trained on 59 million cells, scDiVa achieves strong transfer performance across major benchmarks, including batch integration, cell type annotation, and perturbation response prediction. These results suggest that masked discrete diffusion serves as a biologically coherent and effective alternative to autoregression.

*Qianyi Xu,Gousia Habib,Feng Wu,Yanrui Du,Zhihui Chen,Swapnil Mishra,Dilruk Perera,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an LLM-powered automated pipeline for designing reward functions in clinical reinforcement learning, using potential functions with survival/confidence/competence components and quantitative evaluation metrics to overcome manual reward engineering limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical RL for dynamic treatment regimes is bottlenecked by reward engineering - the challenge of manually defining effective reward signals that generalize across diverse diseases in complex, sparse offline environments.

Method: The authors propose an automated pipeline using LLMs for offline reward design. They formulate reward functions using potential functions with three core components (survival, confidence, competence) and introduce quantitative metrics to rigorously evaluate and select optimal reward structures before deployment.

Result: The framework automates reward function design for specific diseases while significantly enhancing the performance of resulting RL policies.

Conclusion: By integrating LLM-driven domain knowledge, this approach provides a systematic solution to the reward engineering bottleneck in clinical RL, enabling more effective and generalizable dynamic treatment optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful framework for optimizing dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs). However, clinical RL is fundamentally bottlenecked by reward engineering: the challenge of defining signals that safely and effectively guide policy learning in complex, sparse offline environments. Existing approaches often rely on manual heuristics that fail to generalize across diverse pathologies. To address this, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for offline reward design and verification. We formulate the reward function using potential functions consisted of three core components: survival, confidence, and competence. We further introduce quantitative metrics to rigorously evaluate and select the optimal reward structure prior to deployment. By integrating LLM-driven domain knowledge, our framework automates the design of reward functions for specific diseases while significantly enhancing the performance of the resulting policies.

### [259] [Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03501)
*Hai Zhong,Zhuoran Li,Xun Wang,Longbo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization (RFO), which integrates flow policies with reparameterization policy gradients for model-based reinforcement learning, achieving high sample efficiency and nearly double the performance of state-of-the-art baselines on challenging soft-body control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RPG methods were limited to Gaussian policies, restricting performance and preventing the use of advanced generative models. While flow policies naturally align with RPG, naive combination suffers from training instability and poor exploration.

Method: RFO backpropagates gradients jointly through flow generation and system dynamics, avoiding intractable log-likelihood calculations. It includes two tailored regularization terms for stability and exploration, plus an action chunking variant.

Result: Extensive experiments on locomotion and manipulation tasks (rigid/soft bodies, state/visual inputs) demonstrate RFO's effectiveness. On a challenging soft-body quadruped locomotion task, RFO achieves almost 2× the reward of state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: RFO successfully establishes the connection between flow policies and RPG, unlocking high sample efficiency and superior performance, particularly for complex soft-body control problems where it significantly outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Reparameterization Policy Gradient (RPG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for model-based reinforcement learning, enabling high sample efficiency by backpropagating gradients through differentiable dynamics. However, prior RPG approaches have been predominantly restricted to Gaussian policies, limiting their performance and failing to leverage recent advances in generative models. In this work, we identify that flow policies, which generate actions via differentiable ODE integration, naturally align with the RPG framework, a connection not established in prior work. However, naively exploiting this synergy proves ineffective, often suffering from training instability and a lack of exploration. We propose Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization (RFO). RFO computes policy gradients by backpropagating jointly through the flow generation process and system dynamics, unlocking high sample efficiency without requiring intractable log-likelihood calculations. RFO includes two tailored regularization terms for stability and exploration. We also propose a variant of RFO with action chunking. Extensive experiments on diverse locomotion and manipulation tasks, involving both rigid and soft bodies with state or visual inputs, demonstrate the effectiveness of RFO. Notably, on a challenging locomotion task controlling a soft-body quadruped, RFO achieves almost $2\times$ the reward of the state-of-the-art baseline.

Conclusion: 该统一框架无需数据集特定调优，即可实现样本高效且可靠的面向目标发现，在各类高维问题上证明有效。

Abstract: Target-oriented discovery under limited evaluation budgets requires making reliable progress in high-dimensional, heterogeneous design spaces where each new measurement is costly, whether experimental or high-fidelity simulation. We present an information-theoretic framework for target-oriented adaptive sampling that reframes optimization as trajectory discovery: instead of approximating the full response surface, the method maintains and refines a low-entropy information state that concentrates search on target-relevant directions. The approach couples data, model beliefs, and physics/structure priors through dimension-aware information budgeting, adaptive bootstrapped distillation over a heterogeneous surrogate reservoir, and structure-aware candidate manifold analysis with Kalman-inspired multi-model fusion to balance consensus-driven exploitation and disagreement-driven exploration. Evaluated under a single unified protocol without dataset-specific tuning, the framework improves sample efficiency and reliability across 14 single- and multi-objective materials design tasks spanning candidate pools from $600$ to $4 \times 10^6$ and feature dimensions from $10$ to $10^3$, typically reaching top-performing regions within 100 evaluations. Complementary 20-dimensional synthetic benchmarks (Ackley, Rastrigin, Schwefel) further demonstrate robustness to rugged and multimodal landscapes.

Result: 成功分离28个功能电路，首次实现SR Transformer的电路级表征；平均修补结合性能评估最可靠地隔离因果电路；传统方法主要捕获相关性特征，因果发现能力有限。

Conclusion: 证实SR是mechanistic interpretability的高潜力应用域，提出的PATCHES方法论为电路发现提供了原则性框架，推动了可解释AI在科学发现领域的发展。

Abstract: Following their success across many domains, transformers have also proven effective for symbolic regression (SR); however, the internal mechanisms underlying their generation of mathematical operators remain largely unexplored. Although mechanistic interpretability has successfully identified circuits in language and vision models, it has not yet been applied to SR. In this article, we introduce PATCHES, an evolutionary circuit discovery algorithm that identifies compact and correct circuits for SR. Using PATCHES, we isolate 28 circuits, providing the first circuit-level characterisation of an SR transformer. We validate these findings through a robust causal evaluation framework based on key notions such as faithfulness, completeness, and minimality. Our analysis shows that mean patching with performance-based evaluation most reliably isolates functionally correct circuits. In contrast, we demonstrate that direct logit attribution and probing classifiers primarily capture correlational features rather than causal ones, limiting their utility for circuit discovery. Overall, these results establish SR as a high-potential application domain for mechanistic interpretability and propose a principled methodology for circuit discovery.

Conclusion: 非精确梯度框架为拜占庭鲁棒算法提供了统一分析工具，使加速优化成为可能，为设计更复杂鲁棒算法开辟了新途径

Abstract: Standard federated learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial nodes, a.k.a. Byzantine failures. To solve this issue, robust distributed learning algorithms have been developed, which typically replace parameter averaging by robust aggregations. While generic conditions on these aggregations exist to guarantee the convergence of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent (SGD), the analyses remain rather ad-hoc. This hinders the development of more complex robust algorithms, such as accelerated ones. In this work, we show that Byzantine-robust distributed optimization can, under standard generic assumptions, be cast as a general optimization with inexact gradient oracles (with both additive and multiplicative error terms), an active field of research.
  This allows for instance to directly show that GD on top of standard robust aggregation procedures obtains optimal asymptotic error in the Byzantine setting. Going further, we propose two optimization schemes to speed up the convergence. The first one is a Nesterov-type accelerated scheme whose proof directly derives from accelerated inexact gradient results applied to our formulation. The second one hinges on Optimization under Similarity, in which the server leverages an auxiliary loss function that approximates the global loss. Both approaches allow to drastically reduce the communication complexity compared to previous methods, as we show theoretically and empirically.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了异步流水线并行训练中梯度延迟与Hessian特征基失配的关键问题，提出通过基旋转校正延迟梯度，在10亿参数大模型上实现训练迭代次数减少76.8%的显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步流水线并行虽能消除同步气泡、提升硬件利用率，但存在梯度陈旧性问题，且延迟随流水线深度线性增长，破坏可扩展性；更关键的是，延迟梯度导致Hessian特征基与标准坐标基失配，使Adam等自适应优化器无法有效利用曲率信息，引发优化振荡和收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出基旋转方法校正延迟梯度，通过将梯度投影到正确的特征空间来缓解基失配问题，并结合理论分析与实验验证。

Result: 在10亿参数大语言模型训练中，基旋转方案相比最优异步流水线并行基线，可在76.8%更少的迭代次数内达到相同的训练损失，显著提升收敛速度。

Conclusion: 基旋转能有效解决延迟梯度与特征基失配问题，恢复异步训练的可扩展性，同时保持模型性能，为大规模分布式训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Asynchronous pipeline parallelism maximizes hardware utilization by eliminating the pipeline bubbles inherent in synchronous execution, offering a path toward efficient large-scale distributed training. However, this efficiency gain can be compromised by gradient staleness, where the immediate model updates with delayed gradients introduce noise into the optimization process. Crucially, we identify a critical, yet often overlooked, pathology: this delay scales linearly with pipeline depth, fundamentally undermining the very scalability that the method originally intends to provide. In this work, we investigate this inconsistency and bridge the gap by rectifying delayed gradients through basis rotation, restoring scalable asynchronous training while maintaining performance. Specifically, we observe that the deleterious effects of delayed gradients are exacerbated when the Hessian eigenbasis is misaligned with the standard coordinate basis. We demonstrate that this misalignment prevents coordinate-wise adaptive schemes, such as Adam, from effectively leveraging curvature-aware adaptivity. This failure leads to significant oscillations in the optimization trajectory and, consequently, slower convergence. We substantiate these findings through both rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. To address this challenge, we propose the use of basis rotation, demonstrating that it effectively mitigates the alignment issue and significantly accelerates convergence in asynchronous settings. For example, our training of a 1B-parameter LLM with basis rotation achieves the same training loss in 76.8% fewer iterations compared to the best-performing asynchronous pipeline parallel training baseline.

TL;DR: BCP (Bayesian Conformal Prediction) combines Bayesian posterior predictive densities with split conformal framework to achieve valid coverage guarantees with lower run-to-run variability than standard methods, especially robust under model misspecification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard conformal prediction suffers from high variability in prediction set sizes, while Bayesian credible intervals fail under model misspecification. The paper aims to merge Bayesian methods with conformal prediction to obtain both valid coverage and improved efficiency.

Method: Uses Bayesian posterior predictive densities as non-conformity scores and Bayesian quadrature to optimize expected prediction set size within a split conformal framework.

Result: BCP achieves comparable set sizes to split conformal prediction but with substantially lower variability. In sparse regression with 80% nominal coverage, BCP attains 81% empirical coverage under misspecified prior, versus 49% for Bayesian credible intervals. Valid across regression, classification, and distribution-shifted settings (ImageNet-A).

Conclusion: BCP successfully integrates Bayesian methodology with conformal prediction, delivering valid, efficient, and robust uncertainty quantification that maintains coverage guarantees even when models are misspecified or data distribution shifts.

Abstract: Bayesian posterior predictive densities as non-conformity scores and Bayesian quadrature are used to estimate and minimise the expected prediction set size. Operating within a split conformal framework, BCP provides valid coverage guarantees and demonstrates reliable empirical coverage under model misspecification. Across regression and classification tasks, including distribution-shifted settings such as ImageNet-A, BCP yields prediction sets of comparable size to split conformal prediction, while exhibiting substantially lower run-to-run variability in set size. In sparse regression with nominal coverage of 80 percent, BCP achieves 81 percent empirical coverage under a misspecified prior, whereas Bayesian credible intervals under-cover at 49 percent.

Abstract: Live streaming has become a cornerstone of today's internet, enabling massive real-time social interactions. However, it faces severe risks arising from sparse, coordinated malicious behaviors among multiple participants, which are often concealed within normal activities and challenging to detect timely and accurately. In this work, we provide a pioneering study on risk assessment in live streaming rooms, characterized by weak supervision where only room-level labels are available. We formulate the task as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, treating each room as a bag and defining structured user-timeslot capsules as instances. These capsules represent subsequences of user actions within specific time windows, encapsulating localized behavioral patterns. Based on this formulation, we propose AC-MIL, an Action-aware Capsule MIL framework that models both individual behaviors and group-level coordination patterns. AC-MIL captures multi-granular semantics and behavioral cues through a serial and parallel architecture that jointly encodes temporal dynamics and cross-user dependencies. These signals are integrated for robust room-level risk prediction, while also offering interpretable evidence at the behavior segment level. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets from Douyin demonstrate that AC-MIL significantly outperforms MIL and sequential baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in room-level risk assessment for live streaming. Moreover, AC-MIL provides capsule-level interpretability, enabling identification of risky behavior segments as actionable evidence for intervention.

Abstract: Recent progress has expanded the use of large language models (LLMs) in drug discovery, including synthesis planning. However, objective evaluation of retrosynthesis performance remains limited. Existing benchmarks and metrics typically rely on published synthetic procedures and Top-K accuracy based on single ground-truth, which does not capture the open-ended nature of real-world synthesis planning. We propose a new benchmarking framework for single-step retrosynthesis that evaluates both general-purpose and chemistry-specialized LLMs using ChemCensor, a novel metric for chemical plausibility. By emphasizing plausibility over exact match, this approach better aligns with human synthesis planning practices. We also introduce CREED, a novel dataset comprising millions of ChemCensor-validated reaction records for LLM training, and use it to train a model that improves over the LLM baselines under this benchmark.

Abstract: This paper proposes FedNMap, a normal map-based method for composite federated learning, where the objective consists of a smooth loss and a possibly nonsmooth regularizer. FedNMap leverages a normal map-based update scheme to handle the nonsmooth term and incorporates a local correction strategy to mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity across clients. Under standard assumptions, including smooth local losses, weak convexity of the regularizer, and bounded stochastic gradient variance, FedNMap achieves linear speedup with respect to both the number of clients $n$ and the number of local updates $Q$ for nonconvex losses, both with and without the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition. To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing linear speedup for nonconvex composite federated learning.

Conclusion: EVE为机器遗忘验证提供了新颖实用的工具，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Verifying whether the machine unlearning process has been properly executed is critical but remains underexplored. Some existing approaches propose unlearning verification methods based on backdooring techniques. However, these methods typically require participation in the model's initial training phase to backdoor the model for later verification, which is inefficient and impractical. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification of erasure method (EVE) for verifying machine unlearning without requiring involvement in the model's initial training process. The core idea is to perturb the unlearning data to ensure the model prediction of the specified samples will change before and after unlearning with perturbed data. The unlearning users can leverage the observation of the changes as a verification signal. Specifically, the perturbations are designed with two key objectives: ensuring the unlearning effect and altering the unlearned model's prediction of target samples. We formalize the perturbation generation as an adversarial optimization problem, solving it by aligning the unlearning gradient with the gradient of boundary change for target samples. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that EVE can verify machine unlearning without involving the model's initial training process, unlike backdoor-based methods. Moreover, EVE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning verification methods, offering significant speedup in efficiency while enhancing verification accuracy. The source code of EVE is released at \uline{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EVE-C143}, providing a novel tool for verification of machine unlearning.

Motivation: 去中心化学习在非独立同分布数据分布和静态通信拓扑下难以训练出高准确率模型。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Morph算法，核心特点包括：节点基于最大模型差异性自适应选择对等节点；在保持固定入度的同时动态重塑通信图；采用基于gossip的对等节点发现和多样性驱动的邻居选择；提高了对数据异构性的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Morph有效解决了去中心化学习中的非独立同分布数据和静态拓扑挑战，实现了卓越性能、快速收敛和稳定性，且无需全局知识。

Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) enables a set of nodes to train a model collaboratively without central coordination, offering benefits for privacy and scalability. However, DL struggles to train a high accuracy model when the data distribution is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) and when the communication topology is static. To address these issues, we propose Morph, a topology optimization algorithm for DL. In Morph, nodes adaptively choose peers for model exchange based on maximum model dissimilarity. Morph maintains a fixed in-degree while dynamically reshaping the communication graph through gossip-based peer discovery and diversity-driven neighbor selection, thereby improving robustness to data heterogeneity. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST with up to 100 nodes show that Morph consistently outperforms static and epidemic baselines, while closely tracking the fully connected upper bound. On CIFAR-10, Morph achieves a relative improvement of 1.12x in test accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. On FEMNIST, Morph achieves an accuracy that is 1.08x higher than Epidemic Learning. Similar trends hold for 50 node deployments, where Morph narrows the gap to the fully connected upper bound within 0.5 percentage points on CIFAR-10. These results demonstrate that Morph achieves higher final accuracy, faster convergence, and more stable learning as quantified by lower inter-node variance, while requiring fewer communication rounds than baselines and no global knowledge.

Conclusion: 嵌入级预测是一种有前景的日志异常检测方法，也可能适用于其他事件序列分析。

Abstract: Log files record computational events that reflect system state and behavior, making them a primary source of operational insights in modern computer systems. Automated anomaly detection on logs is therefore critical, yet most established methods rely on log parsers that collapse messages into discrete templates, discarding variable values and semantic content. We propose ContraLog, a parser-free and self-supervised method that reframes log anomaly detection as predicting continuous message embeddings rather than discrete template IDs. ContraLog combines a message encoder that produces rich embeddings for individual log messages with a sequence encoder to model temporal dependencies within sequences. The model is trained with a combination of masked language modeling and contrastive learning to predict masked message embeddings based on the surrounding context. Experiments on the HDFS, BGL, and Thunderbird benchmark datasets empirically demonstrate effectiveness on complex datasets with diverse log messages. Additionally, we find that message embeddings generated by ContraLog carry meaningful information and are predictive of anomalies even without sequence context. These results highlight embedding-level prediction as an approach for log anomaly detection, with potential applicability to other event sequences.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, partly because the loss exhibits slow power-law convergence whose origin remains debatable. Through systematic analysis of toy models and empirical evaluation of LLMs, we show that this behavior can arise intrinsically from the use of softmax and cross-entropy. When learning peaked probability distributions, e.g., next-token distributions, these components yield power-law vanishing losses and gradients, creating a fundamental optimization bottleneck. This ultimately leads to power-law time scaling of the loss with a universal exponent of $1/3$. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for observed neural scaling and suggest new directions for improving LLM training efficiency.

*Mattia Sabella,Alberto Archetti,Pietro Pinoli,Matteo Matteucci,Cinzia Cappiello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuAIL integrates feature reliability priors into tabular model training via a constrained modulation layer, enabling robust learning under non-uniform data corruption without explicit data repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular data commonly suffers from non-uniform corruption (noise, missing values, feature biases), but existing robustness techniques are limited by the lack of instance-wise quality labels—only column-level reliability indicators are typically available.

Method: Proposes QuAIL, a quality-informed training mechanism that adds a learnable feature-modulation layer to existing models. This layer's updates are selectively constrained by a quality-dependent proximal regularizer, allowing controlled adaptation across features based on their trustworthiness.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 50 classification/regression datasets shows QuAIL consistently outperforms neural baselines under random and value-dependent corruption, with particularly strong robustness in low-data regimes and systematic bias scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating feature reliability information directly into optimization dynamics is a practical and effective strategy for building resilient tabular learning systems, eliminating the need for explicit data repair or sample reweighting.

Abstract: Tabular machine learning systems are frequently trained on data affected by non-uniform corruption, including noisy measurements, missing entries, and feature-specific biases. In practice, these defects are often documented only through column-level reliability indicators rather than instance-wise quality annotations, limiting the applicability of many robustness and cleaning techniques. We present QuAIL, a quality-informed training mechanism that incorporates feature reliability priors directly into the learning process. QuAIL augments existing models with a learnable feature-modulation layer whose updates are selectively constrained by a quality-dependent proximal regularizer, thereby inducing controlled adaptation across features of varying trustworthiness. This stabilizes optimization under structured corruption without explicit data repair or sample-level reweighting. Empirical evaluation across 50 classification and regression datasets demonstrates that QuAIL consistently improves average performance over neural baselines under both random and value-dependent corruption, with especially robust behavior in low-data and systematically biased settings. These results suggest that incorporating feature reliability information directly into optimization dynamics is a practical and effective approach for resilient tabular learning.

Abstract: We consider small-data, large-scale decision problems in which a firm must make many operational decisions simultaneously (e.g., across a large product portfolio) while observing only a few, potentially noisy, data points per instance. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we propose a pretrain-then-finetune approach built on a designed Transformer model to address this challenge. The model is first pretrained on large-scale, domain-informed synthetic data that encode managerial knowledge and structural features of the decision environment, and is then fine-tuned on real observations. This new pipeline offers two complementary advantages: pretraining injects domain knowledge into the learning process and enables the training of high-capacity models using abundant synthetic data, while finetuning adapts the pretrained model to the operational environment and improves alignment with the true data-generating regime. While we have leveraged the Transformer's state-of-the-art representational capacity, particularly its attention mechanism, to efficiently extract cross-task structure, our approach is not an off-the-shelf application. Instead, it relies on problem-specific architectural design and a tailored training procedure to match the decision setting. Theoretically, we develop the first comprehensive error analysis regarding Transformer learning in relevant contexts, establishing nonasymptotic guarantees that validate the method's effectiveness. Critically, our analysis reveals how pretraining and fine-tuning jointly determine performance, with the dominant contribution governed by whichever is more favorable. In particular, finetuning exhibits an economies-of-scale effect, whereby transfer learning becomes increasingly effective as the number of instances grows.

*Chen-Hui Song,Shuoling Liu,Liyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies the "Label Horizon Paradox" in financial forecasting, showing that optimal training labels often differ from final prediction targets. It proposes a bi-level optimization framework that automatically finds the best proxy labels, demonstrating consistent performance improvements on large-scale financial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors challenge the canonical assumption that training labels must strictly mirror inference targets, noticing that while deep learning architectures have advanced financial forecasting, the design of supervision signals themselves is rarely scrutinized.

Method: The authors theoretically ground the phenomenon in a dynamic signal-noise trade-off and propose a bi-level optimization framework that autonomously identifies the optimal proxy label within a single training run.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale financial datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over conventional baseline methods.

Conclusion: The Label Horizon Paradox reveals that optimal supervision signals should deviate from final prediction goals, opening new avenues for label-centric research in financial forecasting.

Abstract: While deep learning has revolutionized financial forecasting through sophisticated architectures, the design of the supervision signal itself is rarely scrutinized. We challenge the canonical assumption that training labels must strictly mirror inference targets, uncovering the Label Horizon Paradox: the optimal supervision signal often deviates from the prediction goal, shifting across intermediate horizons governed by market dynamics. We theoretically ground this phenomenon in a dynamic signal-noise trade-off, demonstrating that generalization hinges on the competition between marginal signal realization and noise accumulation. To operationalize this insight, we propose a bi-level optimization framework that autonomously identifies the optimal proxy label within a single training run. Extensive experiments on large-scale financial datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over conventional baselines, thereby opening new avenues for label-centric research in financial forecasting.

TL;DR: 本文理论证明了过参数化线性回归中存在任意时间学习率调度，并通过权重平均实现与随机梯度下降minimax收敛率相当的性能。实证表明，在150M/300M参数语言模型上，该调度在未知训练时长场景下能达到与精心调优的余弦调度相当的最终损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型日益在持续或开放环境（训练时长未知）中训练，但现有预训练方案依赖预设时长的学习率调度（如余弦衰减）和大量超参调优，缺乏"任意时间"（anytime）能力。

Method: 1) 理论分析：证明过参数化线性回归中任意时间调度的存在性，揭示权重平均对达成minimax收敛率的核心作用；2) 实证评估：在1-32倍Chinchilla计算量下，对比常数学习率+权重平均、$1/\sqrt{t}$调度+权重平均与余弦调度的效果。

Result: 在完整训练范围内（1-32倍计算量），任意时间调度（尤其是带权重平均的常数/$1/\sqrt{t}$调度）与余弦衰减达到可比的最终损失。

Conclusion: 权重平均结合简单的无时长依赖步长策略，为大规模语言模型预训练提供了实用且有效的任意时间替代方案，降低了对训练时长预设和精细调优的依赖。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly trained in continual or open-ended settings, where the total training horizon is not known in advance. Despite this, most existing pretraining recipes are not anytime: they rely on horizon-dependent learning rate schedules and extensive tuning under a fixed compute budget. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the existence of anytime learning schedules for overparameterized linear regression, and we highlight the central role of weight averaging - also known as model merging - in achieving the minimax convergence rates of stochastic gradient descent. We show that these anytime schedules polynomially decay with time, with the decay rate determined by the source and capacity conditions of the problem. Empirically, we evaluate 150M and 300M parameter language models trained at 1-32x Chinchilla scale, comparing constant learning rates with weight averaging and $1/\sqrt{t}$ schedules with weight averaging against a well-tuned cosine schedule. Across the full training range, the anytime schedules achieve comparable final loss to cosine decay. Taken together, our results suggest that weight averaging combined with simple, horizon-free step sizes offers a practical and effective anytime alternative to cosine learning rate schedules for large language model pretraining.

TL;DR: UniGeM is a unified framework for LLM data curation that treats mixing and selection as manifold approximation, achieving 2x data efficiency and better performance than SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM scaling is limited by data quality, and separate handling of data mixing and sample selection breaks code corpus structure, requiring proxy models or external datasets.

Method: UniGeM unifies mixing and selection via hierarchical manifold approximation: Macro-Exploration uses stability-based clustering for mixing weights, and Micro-Mining filters instances by geometric distribution for logical consistency.

Result: When training 8B and 16B MoE models on 100B tokens, UniGeM achieves 2.0× data efficiency over random baseline and outperforms SOTA methods in reasoning and multilingual tasks.

Conclusion: The unified manifold-based approach effectively curates data without proxies or external references, significantly improving data efficiency and model performance.

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly limited by data quality. Most methods handle data mixing and sample selection separately, which can break the structure in code corpora. We introduce \textbf{UniGeM}, a framework that unifies mixing and selection by treating data curation as a \textit{manifold approximation} problem without training proxy models or relying on external reference datasets. UniGeM operates hierarchically: \textbf{Macro-Exploration} learns mixing weights with stability-based clustering; \textbf{Micro-Mining} filters high-quality instances by their geometric distribution to ensure logical consistency. Validated by training 8B and 16B MoE models on 100B tokens, UniGeM achieves \textbf{2.0$\times$ data efficiency} over a random baseline and further improves overall performance compared to SOTA methods in reasoning-heavy evaluations and multilingual generalization.

*Aneri Muni,Vincent Taboga,Esther Derman,Pierre-Luc Bacon,Erick Delage*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel state augmentation formulation for static CVaR in MDPs that yields dense rewards and contracting Bellman operators, enabling effective risk-averse RL algorithms with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical applications require managing tail-end risks (rare catastrophic events) using measures like static CVaR. However, static CVaR lacks a recursive Bellman decomposition, and classical state augmentation approaches suffer from sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points.

Method: The authors propose an alternative formulation of static CVaR using state augmentation that produces a Bellman operator with dense per-step rewards and contracting properties on bounded value functions. They develop risk-averse value iteration and model-free Q-learning algorithms using discretized augmented states, providing convergence guarantees and discretization error bounds.

Result: The algorithms successfully learn CVaR-sensitive policies and achieve effective performance-safety trade-offs, with theoretical convergence guarantees and approximation error bounds.

Conclusion: The novel formulation resolves fundamental challenges in risk-averse RL for static CVaR, enabling practical algorithms with strong theoretical foundations and empirical performance.

Abstract: Tail-end risk measures such as static conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) are used in safety-critical applications to prevent rare, yet catastrophic events. Unlike risk-neutral objectives, the static CVaR of the return depends on entire trajectories without admitting a recursive Bellman decomposition in the underlying Markov decision process. A classical resolution relies on state augmentation with a continuous variable. However, unless restricted to a specialized class of admissible value functions, this formulation induces sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of the static CVaR objective based on augmentation. Our alternative approach leads to a Bellman operator with: (1) dense per-step rewards; (2) contracting properties on the full space of bounded value functions. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop risk-averse value iteration and model-free Q-learning algorithms that rely on discretized augmented states. We further provide convergence guarantees and approximation error bounds due to discretization. Empirical results demonstrate that our algorithms successfully learn CVaR-sensitive policies and achieve effective performance-safety trade-offs.

TL;DR: A new Soft-Radial Projection layer solves gradient saturation in constrained deep learning by using radial mapping to preserve gradients while ensuring strict feasibility, showing better convergence and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing projection layers for safety-critical systems with hard constraints suffer from gradient saturation due to rank-deficient Jacobians from orthogonal projections, which nullifies gradients and hinders optimization.

Method: Introduces Soft-Radial Projection, a differentiable reparameterization layer that uses radial mapping from Euclidean space into the interior of the feasible set to guarantee strict feasibility while preserving full-rank Jacobian almost everywhere.

Result: Theoretically proven to retain universal approximation property; empirically demonstrates improved convergence behavior and solution quality over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully circumvents gradient saturation and optimization stalls typical of boundary-based projection methods, making it more suitable for safety-critical constrained deep learning systems.

Abstract: Integrating hard constraints into deep learning is essential for safety-critical systems. Yet existing constructive layers that project predictions onto constraint boundaries face a fundamental bottleneck: gradient saturation. By collapsing exterior points onto lower-dimensional surfaces, standard orthogonal projections induce rank-deficient Jacobians, which nullify gradients orthogonal to active constraints and hinder optimization. We introduce Soft-Radial Projection, a differentiable reparameterization layer that circumvents this issue through a radial mapping from Euclidean space into the interior of the feasible set. This construction guarantees strict feasibility while preserving a full-rank Jacobian almost everywhere, thereby preventing the optimization stalls typical of boundary-based methods. We theoretically prove that the architecture retains the universal approximation property and empirically show improved convergence behavior and solution quality over state-of-the-art optimization- and projection-based baselines.

Result: 首个可扩展到100-300+非重叠任务的持续学习器，在多种数据集和设置上领先，包括经典CIL数据集(5-20任务)，并提出了超长序列评估协议

Conclusion: 双层路由MoE机制能有效解决超长序列CIL问题，为大规模持续学习提供了可扩展解决方案

Abstract: Continual learning, especially class-incremental learning (CIL), on the basis of a pre-trained model (PTM) has garnered substantial research interest in recent years. However, how to effectively learn both discriminative and comprehensive feature representations while maintaining stability and plasticity over very long task sequences remains an open problem. We propose CaRE, a scalable {C}ontinual Le{a}rner with efficient Bi-Level {R}outing Mixture-of-{E}xperts (BR-MoE). The core idea of BR-MoE is a bi-level routing mechanism: a router selection stage that dynamically activates relevant task-specific routers, followed by an expert routing phase that dynamically activates and aggregates experts, aiming to inject discriminative and comprehensive representations into every intermediate network layer. On the other hand, we introduce a challenging evaluation protocol for comprehensively assessing CIL methods across very long task sequences spanning hundreds of tasks. Extensive experiments show that CaRE demonstrates leading performance across a variety of datasets and task settings, including commonly used CIL datasets with classical CIL settings (e.g., 5-20 tasks). To the best of our knowledge, CaRE is the first continual learner that scales to very long task sequences (ranging from 100 to over 300 non-overlapping tasks), while outperforming all baselines by a large margin on such task sequences. Code will be publicly released at https://github.com/LMMMEng/CaRE.git.

Conclusion: Cobalt成功融合在线与离线强化学习的优点，为多轮代码生成等迭代决策任务提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, there have been significant research interests in training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) on real-world tasks, such as multi-turn code generation. While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation.

Conclusion: 提出的基于中间组件的LoRA初始化方法在性能与灾难性遗忘之间实现了更优的权衡

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods have emerged as crucial techniques for adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks under computational and memory constraints. However, they face a fundamental challenge in balancing task-specific performance gains against catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge, where existing methods provide inconsistent recommendations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance-forgetting trade-offs inherent in low-rank adaptation using principal components as initialization. Our investigation reveals that fine-tuning intermediate components leads to better balance and show more robustness to high learning rates than first (PiSSA) and last (MiLoRA) components in existing work. Building on these findings, we provide a practical approach for initialization of LoRA that offers superior trade-offs. We demonstrate in a thorough empirical study on a variety of computer vision and NLP tasks that our approach improves accuracy and reduces forgetting, also in continual learning scenarios.

2. 提出"收缩传播条件"，通过展开递推关系推导稳定性证书；
3. 分析证书大小与泛化的关系，并证明存在低风险插值场景使该条件不成立。

3. 实验显示证书增长能有效预测不同优化器、步长和数据扰动下的泛化差异。

Conclusion: 稳定性仅是泛化的部分解释而非普适机制：框架明确了稳定性适用的场景（证书小），同时揭示需其他理论解释的 regime。为理解过参数化模型泛化提供了条件化分析工具。

Abstract: Modern learning systems often interpolate training data while still generalizing well, yet it remains unclear when algorithmic stability explains this behavior. We model training as a function-space trajectory and measure sensitivity to single-sample perturbations along this trajectory.
  We propose a contractive propagation condition and a stability certificate obtained by unrolling the resulting recursion. A small certificate implies stability-based generalization, while we also prove that there exist interpolating regimes with small risk where such contractive sensitivity cannot hold, showing that stability is not a universal explanation.
  Experiments confirm that certificate growth predicts generalization differences across optimizers, step sizes, and dataset perturbations. The framework therefore identifies regimes where stability explains generalization and where alternative mechanisms must account for success.

Result: 发现MAE表示对模糊、遮挡等退化具有鲁棒性；MAE能逐层构建类别感知的潜在空间，使不同类别嵌入在深度上逐渐可分离；与标准ViT不同，MAE在编码器各层中展现出早期且持续的全局注意力。

Conclusion: 这些研究揭示了MAE鲁棒分类性能的机制。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) achieve impressive performance in image classification tasks, yet the internal representations they learn remain less understood. This work started as an attempt to understand the strong downstream classification performance of MAE. In this process we discover that representations learned with the pretraining and fine-tuning, are quite robust - demonstrating a good classification performance in the presence of degradations, such as blur and occlusions. Through layer-wise analysis of token embeddings, we show that pretrained MAE progressively constructs its latent space in a class-aware manner across network depth: embeddings from different classes lie in subspaces that become increasingly separable. We further observe that MAE exhibits early and persistent global attention across encoder layers, in contrast to standard Vision Transformers (ViTs). To quantify feature robustness, we introduce two sensitivity indicators: directional alignment between clean and perturbed embeddings, and head-wise retention of active features under degradations. These studies help establish the robust classification performance of MAEs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MatGPTQ is a novel post-training quantization method that creates a single "sliceable" model supporting multiple precisions at inference time, overcoming the original MatQuant's reliance on expensive training and lack of open-source support. It uses multi-precision optimization with cross-bit error compensation and efficient kernels to achieve state-of-the-art performance across bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant) requires expensive quantization-aware training (QAT) rather than fast post-training quantization (PTQ), and lacks open-source implementation and kernel support, limiting its practical deployment for multi-precision serving.

Method: Introduces MatGPTQ, a one-shot PTQ pipeline that jointly optimizes a single model for multiple target precisions using a multi-precision objective with bit-slicing and cross-bit error compensation. It incorporates budget-aware per-layer bit-width search and provides efficient kernels for slicing and mixed-precision execution.

Result: Across standard LLMs and benchmarks, MatGPTQ preserves high-bit accuracy while significantly improving low-bit performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results for Matryoshka-style post-training quantization.

Conclusion: Makes single-checkpoint, multi-precision deployment open and practical, with code publicly available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/MatGPTQ.

Abstract: Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant) is a recent quantization approach showing that a single integer-quantized model can be served across multiple precisions, by slicing the most significant bits (MSB) at inference time. This enables a single checkpoint to cover a wide range of memory and latency budgets, but renders quantization much more challenging. In particular, the initial MatQuant relies on expensive quantization-aware training (QAT) variants, rather than fast one-shot post training quantization (PTQ), and lacks open-source and kernel support. We address all of these limitations by introducing Post-Training Matryoshka Quantization (MatGPTQ), a new PTQ pipeline that produces a single parent model jointly optimized for multiple target precisions in one-shot, based on a small calibration set. MatGPTQ casts Matryoshka quantization as a multi-precision objective with bit-slicing and cross-bit error compensation, resulting in an algorithm that produces a multi-bit-width, "sliceable" model in a single pass. We also incorporate a new budget-aware search for heterogeneous per-layer bit-witdhs and provide efficient kernels that implement slicing and mixed-precision execution. Across standard LLMs and benchmarks, MatGPTQ preserves high-bit accuracy while substantially improving performance at low-bit-witdh settings. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for Matryoshka-style post-training quantization and make single-checkpoint, multi-precision deployment open and practical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport (OT) on Riemannian manifolds by introducing Riemannian Neural OT (RNOT) maps—continuous neural-network parameterizations that avoid discretization and incorporate geometric structure, achieving sub-exponential complexity while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational optimal transport is useful for generative modeling, but existing neural OT methods are limited to Euclidean geometry. Extending these methods to high-dimensional Riemannian manifolds remains challenging, and the paper proves that discrete approximation approaches necessarily suffer from exponential parameter growth with manifold dimension.

Method: The authors introduce Riemannian Neural OT (RNOT) maps, which are continuous neural-network parameterizations of optimal transport maps on manifolds. These parameterizations avoid discretization entirely and incorporate geometric structure by construction, working directly on the manifold.

Result: Under mild regularity assumptions, the authors prove that RNOT maps can approximate Riemannian optimal transport maps with sub-exponential complexity in dimension. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that RNOT achieves improved scalability while maintaining competitive performance compared to discretization-based baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed RNOT framework provides a principled solution to the curse of dimensionality problem in manifold optimal transport, enabling more efficient and scalable generative modeling on Riemannian manifolds through continuous neural network parameterizations that preserve geometric structure.

Abstract: Computational optimal transport (OT) offers a principled framework for generative modeling. Neural OT methods, which use neural networks to learn an OT map (or potential) from data in an amortized way, can be evaluated out of sample after training, but existing approaches are tailored to Euclidean geometry. Extending neural OT to high-dimensional Riemannian manifolds remains an open challenge. In this paper, we prove that any method for OT on manifolds that produces discrete approximations of transport maps necessarily suffers from the curse of dimensionality: achieving a fixed accuracy requires a number of parameters that grows exponentially with the manifold dimension. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce Riemannian Neural OT (RNOT) maps, which are continuous neural-network parameterizations of OT maps on manifolds that avoid discretization and incorporate geometric structure by construction. Under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that RNOT maps approximate Riemannian OT maps with sub-exponential complexity in the dimension. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate improved scalability and competitive performance relative to discretization-based baselines.

Abstract: Audio-visual joint representation learning under Cross-Modal Generalization (CMG) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source modality to an unlabeled target modality through a unified discrete representation space. Existing symmetric frameworks often suffer from information allocation ambiguity, where the absence of structural inductive bias leads to semantic-specific leakage across modalities. We propose Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring (AHA), which enforces directional information allocation by designating a structured semantic anchor within a shared hierarchy. In our instantiation, we exploit the hierarchical discrete representations induced by audio Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to guide video feature distillation into a shared semantic space. To ensure representational purity, we replace fragile mutual information estimators with a GRL-based adversarial decoupler that explicitly suppresses semantic leakage in modality-specific branches, and introduce Local Sliding Alignment (LSA) to encourage fine-grained temporal alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on AVE and AVVP benchmarks demonstrate that AHA consistently outperforms symmetric baselines in cross-modal transfer. Additional analyses on talking-face disentanglement experiment further validate that the learned representations exhibit improved semantic consistency and disentanglement, indicating the broader applicability of the proposed framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper revisits physics-based inverse design through optimal design points/distributions, proposing a new cost predictor loss, density-gradient optimization, and efficient covariance estimation to improve aerodynamic shape optimization, with validation via OpenFOAM simulations, wind-tunnel tests, and offline RL.


<details>

Motivation: Inverse design with physics-based objectives is challenging because it couples high-dimensional geometry with expensive simulations, as exemplified by aerodynamic shape optimization for drag reduction.

Method: Proposes a new training loss for cost predictors, a density-gradient optimization method that preserves plausible shapes, unifies training-free guided generation methods, and develops a time/memory-efficient algorithm for approximate covariance estimation in high dimensions.

Result: Experiments on 2D studies and 3D aerodynamic benchmarks (car/aircraft) validated by OpenFOAM and wind-tunnel tests with 3D-printed prototypes show consistent gains in optimization and guided generation, with additional offline RL results supporting generality.

Conclusion: The approach achieves consistent improvements in both optimization and guided generation for inverse design problems, demonstrating effectiveness across aerodynamic benchmarks and generality in offline RL settings.

Abstract: Inverse design with physics-based objectives is challenging because it couples high-dimensional geometry with expensive simulations, as exemplified by aerodynamic shape optimization for drag reduction. We revisit inverse design through two canonical solutions, the optimal design point and the optimal design distribution, and relate them to optimization and guided generation. Building on this view, we propose a new training loss for cost predictors and a density-gradient optimization method that improves objectives while preserving plausible shapes. We further unify existing training-free guided generation methods. To address their inability to approximate conditional covariance in high dimensions, we develop a time- and memory-efficient algorithm for approximate covariance estimation. Experiments on a controlled 2D study and high-fidelity 3D aerodynamic benchmarks (car and aircraft), validated by OpenFOAM simulations and miniature wind-tunnel tests with 3D-printed prototypes, demonstrate consistent gains in both optimization and guided generation. Additional offline RL results further support the generality of our approach.

*Cristian Manca,Christian Scano,Giorgio Piras,Fabio Brau,Maura Pintor,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes SAGE-5GC, a security-aware evaluation framework for ML-based anomaly detection in 5G Core networks, demonstrating that adversarial attacks can significantly degrade detection performance and highlighting the need for robust evaluation methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing ML-based anomaly detection approaches for 5G Core networks rely on unrealistic assumptions (IID data, no adaptive attackers) that don't hold in operational environments, creating a gap between research and real-world deployment.

Method: The authors propose SAGE-5GC guidelines, train anomaly detectors on a realistic 5G Core dataset against PFCP attacks, evaluate adversarial evasion through feature manipulation, analyze model robustness via randomized perturbations, and introduce a genetic algorithm-based optimization strategy for crafting adversarial attacks using only controllable features.

Result: Adversarially crafted attacks can substantially degrade detection performance, revealing vulnerabilities in current anomaly detection systems under realistic threat models.

Conclusion: Robust, security-aware evaluation methodologies are critically needed for anomaly detection systems deployed in real-world 5G networks to ensure resilience against adaptive attackers.

Abstract: Machine learning-based anomaly detection systems are increasingly being adopted in 5G Core networks to monitor complex, high-volume traffic. However, most existing approaches are evaluated under strong assumptions that rarely hold in operational environments, notably the availability of independent and identically distributed (IID) data and the absence of adaptive attackers.In this work, we study the problem of detecting 5G attacks \textit{in the wild}, focusing on realistic deployment settings. We propose a set of Security-Aware Guidelines for Evaluating anomaly detectors in 5G Core Network (SAGE-5GC), driven by domain knowledge and consideration of potential adversarial threats. Using a realistic 5G Core dataset, we first train several anomaly detectors and assess their baseline performance against standard 5GC control-plane cyberattacks targeting PFCP-based network services.We then extend the evaluation to adversarial settings, where an attacker tries to manipulate the observable features of the network traffic to evade detection, under the constraint that the intended functionality of the malicious traffic is preserved. Starting from a selected set of controllable features, we analyze model sensitivity and adversarial robustness through randomized perturbations. Finally, we introduce a practical optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms that operates exclusively on attacker-controllable features and does not require prior knowledge of the underlying detection model. Our experimental results show that adversarially crafted attacks can substantially degrade detection performance, underscoring the need for robust, security-aware evaluation methodologies for anomaly detection in 5G networks deployed in the wild.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了反事实解释(CFs)如何通过查询API增强MLaaS系统中的成员推断攻击(MIAs)，并提出结合差分隐私(DP)与主动学习(AL)的防御框架来平衡隐私、效用和可解释性之间的三元权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着反事实解释在MLaaS系统中日益普及以提高透明度，但通过API部署的模型已面临成员推断和模型提取等隐私攻击威胁，而解释功能对此威胁面的影响尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 首先系统分析暴露CFs如何通过基于查询的API使影子模型MIAs更有效；其次提出将差分隐私与主动学习集成的防御框架，以减少记忆化并限制训练数据暴露；最后进行广泛实证评估来刻画隐私泄露、预测性能和解释质量之间的三元权衡。

Result: CFs确实会扩大MLaaS的攻击面并增强成员推断攻击效果；DP-AL框架能有效缓解这一新兴风险；存在隐私泄露、预测性能和解释质量三者之间的显著权衡关系。

Conclusion: 在可解释MLaaS系统的负责任部署中，必须审慎平衡透明度、效用和隐私三者之间的关系，不能以牺牲隐私为代价换取透明度和效用。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) are increasingly integrated into Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) systems to improve transparency; however, ML models deployed via APIs are already vulnerable to privacy attacks such as membership inference and model extraction, and the impact of explanations on this threat landscape remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we focus on the problem of how CFs expand the attack surface of MLaaS by strengthening membership inference attacks (MIAs), and on the need to design defense mechanisms that mitigate this emerging risk without undermining utility and explainability. First, we systematically analyze how exposing CFs through query-based APIs enables more effective shadow-based MIAs. Second, we propose a defense framework that integrates Differential Privacy (DP) with Active Learning (AL) to jointly reduce memorization and limit effective training data exposure. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation to characterize the three-way trade-off between privacy leakage, predictive performance, and explanation quality. Our findings highlight the need to carefully balance transparency, utility, and privacy in the responsible deployment of explainable MLaaS systems.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，Phys-Instruct是一种新颖、有效且高效的框架，能够实现由深度生成模型驱动的超快速PDE求解。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have demonstrated impressive accuracy and generalization in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they still face significant limitations, such as high sampling costs and insufficient physical consistency, stemming from their many-step iterative sampling mechanism and lack of explicit physics constraints. To address these issues, we propose Phys-Instruct, a novel physics-guided distillation framework which not only (1) compresses a pre-trained diffusion PDE solver into a few-step generator via matching generator and prior diffusion distributions to enable rapid sampling, but also (2) enhances the physics consistency by explicitly injecting PDE knowledge through a PDE distillation guidance. Physic-Instruct is built upon a solid theoretical foundation, leading to a practical physics-constrained training objective that admits tractable gradients. Across five PDE benchmarks, Phys-Instruct achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference while reducing PDE error by more than 8 times compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines. Moreover, the resulting unconditional student model functions as a compact prior, enabling efficient and physically consistent inference for various downstream conditional tasks. Our results indicate that Phys-Instruct is a novel, effective, and efficient framework for ultra-fast PDE solving powered by deep generative models.

Abstract: Generating synthetic tabular data under severe class imbalance is essential for domains where rare but high-impact events drive decision-making. However, most generative models either overlook minority groups or fail to produce samples that are useful for downstream learning. We introduce CTTVAE, a Conditional Transformer-based Tabular Variational Autoencoder equipped with two complementary mechanisms: (i) a class-aware triplet margin loss that restructures the latent space for sharper intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, and (ii) a training-by-sampling strategy that adaptively increases exposure to underrepresented groups. Together, these components form CTTVAE+TBS, a framework that consistently yields more representative and utility-aligned samples without destabilizing training. Across six real-world benchmarks, CTTVAE+TBS achieves the strongest downstream utility on minority classes, often surpassing models trained on the original imbalanced data while maintaining competitive fidelity and bridging the gap for privacy for interpolation-based sampling methods and deep generative methods. Ablation studies further confirm that both latent structuring and targeted sampling contribute to these gains. By explicitly prioritizing downstream performance in rare categories, CTTVAE+TBS provides a robust and interpretable solution for conditional tabular data generation, with direct applicability to industries such as healthcare, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance where even small gains in minority cases can be critical.

Conclusion: 该RL方法有效解决了检索器优化中的目标不匹配和状态混淆挑战，为提升RAG系统性能提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to produce evidence-based responses, and its performance hinges on the matching between the retriever and LLMs. Retriever optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative to fine-tuning LLMs. However, existing solutions suffer from objective mismatch between retriever optimization and the goal of RAG pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising solution to address this limitation, yet applying RL to retriever optimization introduces two fundamental challenges: 1) the deterministic retrieval is incompatible with RL formulations, and 2) state aliasing arises from query-only retrieval in multi-hop reasoning. To address these challenges, we replace deterministic retrieval with stochastic sampling and formulate RAG as a Markov decision process, making retriever optimizable by RL. Further, we incorporate retrieval history into the state at each retrieval step to mitigate state aliasing. Extensive experiments across diverse RAG pipelines, datasets, and retriever scales demonstrate consistent improvements of our approach in RAG performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need up-to-date internal knowledge, but full retraining is expensive. Existing efficient methods like model editing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning suffer from poor generalization, limited stability, and knowledge conflicts.

Method: CoRSA (Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization) framework: minimizes loss curvature to improve generalization and stability, and maximizes margin between new and prior knowledge to resolve conflicts, enabling parameter-efficient knowledge editing with multiple updates.

Result: On three fact editing benchmarks: 12.42% average improvement over LoRA and 10% over model editing methods in generalization; 27.82% reduction in catastrophic forgetting versus LoRA with multiple updates; 5.48% Pass@5 improvement in code domain update efficacy.

Conclusion: CoRSA provides a holistic, parameter-efficient solution for knowledge editing that effectively addresses key limitations of prior methods, demonstrating strong performance across both factual knowledge and code domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on internal knowledge to solve many downstream tasks, making it crucial to keep them up to date. Since full retraining is expensive, prior work has explored efficient alternatives such as model editing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, these approaches often break down in practice due to poor generalization across inputs, limited stability, and knowledge conflict. To address these limitations, we propose the CoRSA (Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization) training framework, a parameter-efficient, holistic approach for knowledge editing with multiple updates. CoRSA tackles multiple challenges simultaneously: it improves generalization to different input forms and enhances stability across multiple updates by minimizing loss curvature, and resolves conflicts by maximizing the margin between new and prior knowledge. Across three widely used fact editing benchmarks, CoRSA achieves significant gains in generalization, outperforming baselines with average absolute improvements of 12.42% over LoRA and 10% over model editing methods. With multiple updates, it maintains high update efficacy while reducing catastrophic forgetting by 27.82% compared to LoRA. CoRSA also generalizes to the code domain, outperforming the strongest baseline by 5.48% Pass@5 in update efficacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Spectral Shaping (ASS), a data-driven graph filtering framework that learns a reusable baseline spectral kernel modulated by Gaussian factors for interpretable, multi-scale responses. It avoids expensive eigendecompositions via Chebyshev expansions and extends to Transferable ASS (TASS) for few-shot transfer learning across graphs. Evaluated on synthetic benchmarks, ASS reduces reconstruction error versus fixed wavelets and linear banks, while TASS achieves consistent positive transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph filters need to allocate energy across heterogeneous spectral regions while maintaining interpretability and scalability. Existing methods like fixed-prototype wavelets and learned linear banks are limited in flexibility. Additionally, there's a need for transfer learning capabilities to adapt filters across different graphs with limited data and matched computational budgets.

Method: The method learns a reusable baseline spectral kernel and modulates it with a small set of Gaussian factors to create multi-peak, multi-scale responses with explicit centers and bandwidths for interpretability. For scalability, filters are implemented using Chebyshev polynomial expansions instead of eigendecompositions. The Transferable variant (TASS) learns the baseline on source graphs and adapts only shaping parameters on target graphs for few-shot transfer.

Result: On synthetic benchmarks across diverse graph families and signal regimes, Adaptive Spectral Shaping reduces reconstruction error compared to fixed-prototype wavelets and learned linear banks. Transferable Adaptive Spectral Shaping (TASS) demonstrates consistent positive transfer performance.

Conclusion: The framework provides compact, interpretable spectral modules that integrate into graph signal processing pipelines and graph neural networks, successfully combining scalability, interpretability, and cross-graph generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Spectral Shaping, a data-driven framework for graph filtering that learns a reusable baseline spectral kernel and modulates it with a small set of Gaussian factors. The resulting multi-peak, multi-scale responses allocate energy to heterogeneous regions of the Laplacian spectrum while remaining interpretable via explicit centers and bandwidths. To scale, we implement filters with Chebyshev polynomial expansions, avoiding eigendecompositions. We further propose Transferable Adaptive Spectral Shaping (TASS): the baseline kernel is learned on source graphs and, on a target graph, kept fixed while only the shaping parameters are adapted, enabling few-shot transfer under matched compute. Across controlled synthetic benchmarks spanning graph families and signal regimes, Adaptive Spectral Shaping reduces reconstruction error relative to fixed-prototype wavelets and learned linear banks, and TASS yields consistent positive transfer. The framework provides compact spectral modules that plug into graph signal processing pipelines and graph neural networks, combining scalability, interpretability, and cross-graph generalization.

Conclusion: LDR为玻尔兹曼发生器提供了广泛适用的正则化方案，显著增强了其实用性，使其在保持性能的同时大幅降低数据需求。

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized probability densities is a central challenge in computational science. Boltzmann generators are generative models that enable independent sampling from the Boltzmann distribution of physical systems at a given temperature. However, their practical success depends on data-efficient training, as both simulation data and target energy evaluations are costly. To this end, we propose off-policy log-dispersion regularization (LDR), a novel regularization framework that builds on a generalization of the log-variance objective. We apply LDR in the off-policy setting in combination with standard data-based training objectives, without requiring additional on-policy samples. LDR acts as a shape regularizer of the energy landscape by leveraging additional information in the form of target energy labels. The proposed regularization framework is broadly applicable, supporting unbiased or biased simulation datasets as well as purely variational training without access to target samples. Across all benchmarks, LDR improves both final performance and data efficiency, with sample efficiency gains of up to one order of magnitude.

Conclusion: 该加速框架有效解决了MWEM的可扩展性瓶颈，为处理大规模私有数据查询和约束优化问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The Multiplicative Weights Exponential Mechanism (MWEM) is a fundamental iterative framework for private data analysis, with broad applications such as answering $m$ linear queries, or privately solving systems of $m$ linear constraints. However, a critical bottleneck hindering its scalability is the $Θ(m)$ time complexity required to execute the exponential mechanism in each iteration. We introduce a modification to the MWEM framework that improves the per-iteration runtime dependency to $Θ(\sqrt{m})$ in expectation. This is done via a lazy sampling approach to the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism, which we implement efficiently using Gumbel noise and a $k$-Nearest Neighbor data structure. This allows for the rapid selection of the approximate score in the exponential mechanism without an exhaustive linear scan. We apply our accelerated framework to the problems of private linear query release and solving Linear Programs (LPs) under neighboring constraint conditions and low-sensitivity assumptions. Experimental evaluation confirms that our method provides a substantial runtime improvement over classic MWEM.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently become competitive with autoregressive models for language modeling, even outperforming them on reasoning tasks requiring planning and global coherence, but they require more computation at inference time. We trace this trade-off to a key mechanism: diffusion models are trained to jointly predict a distribution over all unknown tokens, including those that will not actually be decoded in the current step. Ablating this joint prediction yields faster inference but degrades performance, revealing that accurate prediction at the decoded position relies on joint reasoning about the distribution of undecoded tokens. We interpret these as latent tokens and introduce a method for modulating their number, demonstrating empirically that this enables a smooth tradeoff between inference speed and sample quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that latent tokens can be introduced into autoregressive models through an auxiliary multi-token prediction objective, yielding substantial improvements on the same reasoning tasks where they have traditionally struggled. Our results suggest that latent tokens, while arising naturally in diffusion, represent a general mechanism for improving performance on tasks requiring global coherence or lookahead.

*Ian Wu,Yuxiao Qu,Amrith Setlur,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes RC, an iterative decoding algorithm that enables LLMs to extrapolate and improve performance far beyond training budgets by exploiting the asymmetry between generation and summarization capabilities to build self-improving reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reinforcement learning cannot support extrapolation during test-time distribution shifts because it operates with fixed problem distributions and training budgets, limiting LLMs' ability to adapt and solve increasingly difficult problems beyond their training scope.

Method: RC (Reasoning Chain) is an iterative decoding algorithm that replaces standard autoregressive decoding during both training and inference, constructing reasoning chains that consistently improve across iterations by leveraging LLMs' differential capabilities in response generation versus summarization.

Result: A 4B model trained with RC using a 16k-token budget improved HMMT 2025 performance from 40% to nearly 70% with 0.5m test-time tokens, outperforming comparable and larger reasoning LLMs, while demonstrating enhanced ability to leverage existing scaffolds for further scaling.

Conclusion: RC enables LLMs to extrapolate and continually improve over reasoning horizons more than an order of magnitude longer than training, unlocking substantial test-time performance gains through learned summary-conditioned generation abilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) that can continually improve beyond their training budgets are able to solve increasingly difficult problems by adapting at test time, a property we refer to as extrapolation. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) operates over fixed problem distributions and training budgets, which limits extrapolation amidst distribution shift at test time. To address this, we introduce RC, an iterative decoding algorithm that replaces standard autoregressive decoding during both training and inference. RC exploits an asymmetry between the response generation and summarization capabilities of LLMs to construct reasoning chains that consistently improve across iterations. Models trained to use RC can extrapolate and continually improve over reasoning horizons more than an order of magnitude longer than those seen during training. Empirically, training a 4B model with RC using a 16k-token training budget improves performance on HMMT 2025 from 40% to nearly 70% with 0.5m tokens at test time, outperforming both comparably sized models and many larger reasoning LLMs. Finally, we also show that models trained with RC can more effectively leverage existing scaffolds to further scale test-time performance, due to the improved summary-conditioned generation abilities learned through training.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is the process of efficiently removing specific information from a trained machine learning model without retraining from scratch. Existing unlearning methods, which often provide provable guarantees, typically involve retraining a subset of model parameters based on a forget set. While these approaches show promise in certain scenarios, their underlying assumptions are often challenged in real-world applications -- particularly when applied to generative models. Furthermore, updating parameters using these unlearning procedures often degrades the general-purpose capabilities the model acquired during pre-training. Motivated by these shortcomings, this paper considers the paradigm of inference time unlearning -- wherein, the generative model is equipped with an (approximately correct) verifier that judges whether the model's response satisfies appropriate unlearning guarantees. This paper introduces a framework that iteratively refines the quality of the generated responses using feedback from the verifier without updating the model parameters. The proposed framework leverages conformal prediction to reduce computational overhead and provide distribution-free unlearning guarantees. This paper's approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, reducing unlearning error by up to 93% across challenging unlearning benchmarks.

Motivation: 生成式建模的进步使合成数据被视为解决数据访问、稀缺和代表性不足问题的首选方案，但缺乏对其适用性的系统性评估。

Method: 针对三个核心用例（隐私保护的数据共享、机器学习训练增强、统计估计方差降低），通过形式化问题建模结合案例研究，分析合成数据达成目标的条件。

Result: 识别出制约合成数据有效性的根本性和实践性限制，发现由于这些限制，许多现有或设想的合成数据应用场景并不适合。

Conclusion: 合成数据并非万能解决方案，本文提供形式化框架帮助决策者评估其是否适合特定数据可用性问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modelling have led many to see synthetic data as the go-to solution for a range of problems around data access, scarcity, and under-representation. In this paper, we study three prominent use cases: (1) Sharing synthetic data as a proxy for proprietary datasets to enable statistical analyses while protecting privacy, (2) Augmenting machine learning training sets with synthetic data to improve model performance, and (3) Augmenting datasets with synthetic data to reduce variance in statistical estimation. For each use case, we formalise the problem setting and study, through formal analysis and case studies, under which conditions synthetic data can achieve its intended objectives. We identify fundamental and practical limits that constrain when synthetic data can serve as an effective solution for a particular problem. Our analysis reveals that due to these limits many existing or envisioned use cases of synthetic data are a poor problem fit. Our formalisations and classification of synthetic data use cases enable decision makers to assess whether synthetic data is a suitable approach for their specific data availability problem.

Abstract: We present a new paradigm for creating random features to approximate bi-variate functions (in particular, kernels) defined on general manifolds. This new mechanism of Manifold Random Features (MRFs) leverages discretization of the manifold and the recently introduced technique of Graph Random Features (GRFs) to learn continuous fields on manifolds. Those fields are used to find continuous approximation mechanisms that otherwise, in general scenarios, cannot be derived analytically. MRFs provide positive and bounded features, a key property for accurate, low-variance approximation. We show deep asymptotic connection between GRFs, defined on discrete graph objects, and continuous random features used for regular kernels. As a by-product of our method, we re-discover recently introduced mechanism of Gaussian kernel approximation applied in particular to improve linear-attention Transformers, considering simple random walks on graphs and by-passing original complex mathematical computations. We complement our algorithm with a rigorous theoretical analysis and verify in thorough experimental studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究在CTF子通道代码中开发和部署了基于单管的ML模型，但全尺寸反应堆堆芯模拟需要使用棒束几何结构。棒束存在复杂的热工水力现象（如通道间交叉流、定位格架损失、非加热导体效应），因此需要研究ML模型从单管数据到棒束应用的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 在棒束几何中，经过单管数据训练的ML-based CHF预测模型能够良好泛化，混合LUT模型是最佳选择，为全尺寸反应堆堆芯模拟提供了更准确的预测工具。

Abstract: The prediction of critical heat flux (CHF) using machine learning (ML) approaches has become a highly active research activity in recent years, the goal of which is to build models more accurate than current conventional approaches such as empirical correlations or lookup tables (LUTs). Previous work developed and deployed tube-based pure and hybrid ML models in the CTF subchannel code, however, full-scale reactor core simulations require the use of rod bundle geometries. Unlike isolated subchannels, rod bundles experience complex thermal hydraulic phenomena such as channel crossflow, spacer grid losses, and effects from unheated conductors. This study investigates the generalization of ML-based CHF prediction models in rod bundles after being trained on tube-based CHF data. A purely data-driven DNN and two hybrid bias-correction models were implemented in the CTF subchannel code and used to predict CHF location and magnitude in the Combustion Engineering 5-by-5 bundle CHF test series. The W-3 correlation, Bowring correlation, and Groeneveld LUT were used as baseline comparators. On average, all three ML-based approaches produced magnitude and location predictions more accurate than the baseline models, with the hybrid LUT model exhibiting the most favorable performance metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数值/神经方法仅能在离散或隐式函数空间近似求解PDE，缺乏可解释性；传统符号生成器表达能力有限且难以处理非光滑行为，亟需直接操作符号空间的端到端框架

Method: 1. 将符号求解建模为树结构决策问题，通过强化学习优化候选解；2. 设计SymFormer结构感知Transformer，采用树相对自注意力建模层次依赖，结合语法约束自回归解码保证语法有效性

Result: 在无需真实表达式条件下，成功精确恢复非光滑及含参数PDE的符号化解，验证了深度符号方法对复杂解析解的端到端发现能力

Conclusion: SymPlex首次在符号表达式空间实现PDE可解释精确求解，突破传统方法在可解释性与非光滑行为建模的局限，为科学计算提供新范式

Abstract: We propose SymPlex, a reinforcement learning framework for discovering analytical symbolic solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) without access to ground-truth expressions. SymPlex formulates symbolic PDE solving as tree-structured decision-making and optimizes candidate solutions using only the PDE and its boundary conditions. At its core is SymFormer, a structure-aware Transformer that models hierarchical symbolic dependencies via tree-relative self-attention and enforces syntactic validity through grammar-constrained autoregressive decoding, overcoming the limited expressivity of sequence-based generators. Unlike numerical and neural approaches that approximate solutions in discretized or implicit function spaces, SymPlex operates directly in symbolic expression space, enabling interpretable and human-readable solutions that naturally represent non-smooth behavior and explicit parametric dependence. Empirical results demonstrate exact recovery of non-smooth and parametric PDE solutions using deep learning-based symbolic methods.

TL;DR: 提出RIFT算法解决从噪声人类干预数据中学习的挑战，通过残差微调结合先验策略，实现稳健的策略改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主系统测试中的人类干预数据常见但噪声大、不完整，需要开发能对此类信号保持稳健的学习方法以指导策略改进。

Method: 定义稳健干预学习(RIL)问题，提出残差干预微调(RIFT)算法，将干预反馈视为不完整信号，并通过残差方式与先验策略显式结合。

Conclusion: 稳健干预学习是一个有前景的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Human interventions are a common source of data in autonomous systems during testing. These interventions provide an important signal about where the current policy needs improvement, but are often noisy and incomplete. We define Robust Intervention Learning (RIL) as the problem of learning from intervention data while remaining robust to the quality and informativeness of the intervention signal. In the best case, interventions are precise and avoiding them is sufficient to solve the task, but in many realistic settings avoiding interventions is necessary but not sufficient for achieving good performance. We study robust intervention learning in the context of emergency stop interventions and propose Residual Intervention Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a residual fine-tuning algorithm that treats intervention feedback as an incomplete learning signal and explicitly combines it with a prior policy. By framing intervention learning as a fine-tuning problem, our approach leverages structure encoded in the prior policy to resolve ambiguity when intervention signals under-specify the task. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing conditions under which this formulation yields principled policy improvement, and identify regimes where intervention learning is expected to fail. Our experiments reveal that residual fine-tuning enables robust and consistent policy improvement across a range of intervention strategies and prior policy qualities, and highlight robust intervention learning as a promising direction for future work.

### [306] [Understanding and Exploiting Weight Update Sparsity for Communication-Efficient Distributed RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03839)
*Erfan Miahi,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper systematically studies weight-update sparsity in RL for LLMs and finds it exceeds 99%. They propose PULSE, a lossless sparse encoding method that transmits only modified parameters, achieving 100x bandwidth reduction (14GB to 108MB) while maintaining identical training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In bandwidth-constrained distributed RL for LLMs, scalability is bottlenecked by policy weight synchronization, especially over commodity networks or in decentralized settings. Previous observations about sparse updates are based on coarse checkpoint differences, lacking systematic empirical validation at fine-grained levels.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic empirical study of weight-update sparsity at step-level and multi-step granularities across training dynamics, off-policy delay, and model scale. They propose PULSE (Patch Updates via Lossless Sparse Encoding), which transmits only indices and values of modified parameters using lossless compression.

Result: Update sparsity consistently exceeds 99% across practical settings. PULSE achieves over 100x communication reduction (14GB to ~108MB), maintains bit-identical training dynamics and performance, reduces required bandwidth from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s, and enables decentralized RL training to approach centralized throughput. The method is robust to transmission errors and avoids floating-point drift.

Conclusion: Exploiting the inherent high sparsity of weight updates enables highly efficient decentralized RL training. PULSE provides a simple yet effective solution that dramatically reduces bandwidth requirements while preserving training integrity, making large-scale distributed RL feasible over commodity networks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component for post-training large language models (LLMs). However, in bandwidth-constrained distributed RL, scalability is often bottlenecked by the synchronization of policy weights from trainers to inference workers, particularly over commodity networks or in decentralized settings. While recent studies suggest that RL updates modify only a small fraction of model parameters, these observations are typically based on coarse checkpoint differences. We present a systematic empirical study of weight-update sparsity at both step-level and multi-step granularities, examining its evolution across training dynamics, off-policy delay, and model scale. We find that update sparsity is consistently high, frequently exceeding 99% across practically relevant settings. Leveraging this structure, we propose PULSE (Patch Updates via Lossless Sparse Encoding), a simple yet highly efficient lossless weight synchronization method that transmits only the indices and values of modified parameters. PULSE is robust to transmission errors and avoids floating-point drift inherent in additive delta schemes. In bandwidth-constrained decentralized environments, our approach achieves over 100x (14 GB to ~108 MB) communication reduction while maintaining bit-identical training dynamics and performance compared to full weight synchronization. By exploiting this structure, PULSE enables decentralized RL training to approach centralized throughput, reducing the bandwidth required for weight synchronization from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s to maintain high GPU utilization.
