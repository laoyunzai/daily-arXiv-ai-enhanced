However, most existing training algorithms for BNNs rely on quantization-aware floating-point Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), limiting the full exploitation of binary operations to the inference phase only. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a fully binary and gradient-free training algorithm for multi-layer BNNs, eliminating the need for back-propagated floating-point gradients. Specifically, the proposed algorithm relies on local binary error signals and binary weight updates, employing integer-valued hidden weights that serve as a synaptic metaplasticity mechanism, thereby enhancing its neurobiological plausibility. Our proposed solution enables the training of binary multi-layer perceptrons by using exclusively XNOR, Popcount, and increment/decrement operations. Experimental results on multi-class classification benchmarks show test accuracy improvements of up to +35.47% over the only existing fully binary single-layer state-of-the-art solution. Compared to full-precision SGD, our solution improves test accuracy by up to +35.30% under the same total memory demand, while also reducing computational cost by two to three orders of magnitude in terms of the total number of Boolean gates. The proposed algorithm is made available to the scientific community as a public repository."}

To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks(ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate gradient-based counterfactual analysis for policy interventions."}

While uncorrelated disorder is widely accepted to localize all single-particle eigenstates, a phenomenon typically reinforced by interactions in the Many-Body Localization (MBL) regime, we report a counter-intuitive breakdown of this paradigm. We demonstrate that strong repulsive interactions can overcome disorder-induced localization, driving the system into a macroscopically segregated phase where spin species accumulate at opposite boundaries. Although this boundary accumulation phenomenologically mimics the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect (NHSE) observed in non-reciprocal systems, our comprehensive analysis reveals a fundamentally different origin. By performing a rigorous control experiment in the Hermitian limit, we prove that the segregation persists without non-reciprocity, identifying many-body energy minimization as the primary driver. This \"interaction-induced segregation\" manifests as a sharp thermodynamic crossover, characterized by a divergent energy susceptibility, challenging the conventional understanding of disorder-interaction competition in open quantum systems."}

These include computational constraints, the limitations of single-view learning algorithms and the complexity of processing large datasets from different domains, sources or views. In this context, multi-view clustering (MVC), a class of unsupervised multi-view learning, emerges as a powerful approach to overcome these challenges. MVC compensates for the shortcomings of single-view methods and provides a richer data representation and effective solutions for a variety of unsupervised learning tasks. In contrast to traditional single-view approaches, the semantically rich nature of multi-view data increases its practical utility despite its inherent complexity. This survey makes a threefold contribution: (1) a systematic categorization of multi-view clustering methods into well-defined groups, including co-training, co-regularization, subspace, deep learning, kernel-based, anchor-based, and graph-based strategies; (2) an in-depth analysis of their respective strengths, weaknesses, and practical challenges, such as scalability and incomplete data; and (3) a forward-looking discussion of emerging trends, interdisciplinary applications, and future directions in MVC research. This study represents an extensive workload, encompassing the review of over 140 foundational and recent publications, the development of comparative insights on integration strategies such as early fusion, late fusion, and joint learning, and the structured investigation of practical use cases in the areas of healthcare, multimedia, and social network analysis. By integrating these efforts, this work aims to fill existing gaps in MVC research and provide actionable insights for the advancement of the field."}

Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro and delivered through a lightweight Gradio front-end with client-side bpmn-js visualisation, the assistant conducts an interview-style dialogue: it elicits process details, supports clarifying dialogue and on-demand analysis, and renders live diagrams that users can refine in real time. A proof-of-concept evaluation in an equipment-maintenance scenario shows that the chatbot produced an accurate \"AS-IS\" model, flagged issues via on-diagram annotations, and generated an improved \"TO-BE\" variant, all within about 12-minutes, while keeping API costs within an SME-friendly budget. The study analyses latency sources, model-selection trade-offs, and the challenges of enforcing strict XML schemas, then outlines a roadmap toward agentic and multimodal deployments.

Among the various reinforcement learning methodologies, gradient-based approaches, particularly policy gradient methods, are considered to have many benefits. Moreover, in the quantum regime, they also have a profit in that they can be readily implemented through parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). From the perspective of learning, two indicators can be regarded as most crucial: expressivity and, for gradient-based methods, trainability. While a number of attempts have been made to quantify the expressivity and trainability of PQCs, clear efforts in the context of reinforcement learning have so far been lacking. Therefore, in this study, we newly define the notion of expressivity suited to reinforcement learning and demonstrate that the mutual information between action distribution and reward-signal distribution can, in certain respects, indicate information about both expressivity and trainability. Such research is valuable in that it provides an easy criterion for choosing among various PQCs employed in reinforcement learning, and further, enables the indirect estimation of learning progress even in black-box settings where the agent's achievement aligned with the episodes cannot be explicitly evaluated."}

However, existing approaches typically rely on uniform random masking, implicitly assuming all features are equally predictable. In reality, laboratory tests exhibit substantial heterogeneity in volatility: some biomarkers (e.g., sodium) remain stable, while others (e.g., lactate) fluctuate considerably and are more difficult to model. Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies. Experiments on a large panel of laboratory tests show that CV-Masking enhances reconstruction, improves downstream predictive performance, and accelerates convergence, producing more robust and clinically meaningful EHR representations."}

We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings."}

Environmental noise also has a crucial role in controlling this class of hysteresis. The relaxational delay of the system's response towards the periodic drive manifests in the response function-field hysteresis loops. These hysteresis loops are generally symmetric in the range of the external force and the response function. Symmetry breaking is observed under extreme conditions of the noise strength, amplitude and frequency of the periodic force. This symmetric-asymmetric dynamic transition is interpreted in terms of the relevant order parameter defined for the system under study. In our present work, we importantly identify that it is possible to induce symmetry breaking in the hysteresis loops, and consequently to observe dynamic transitions under moderate conditions as well if appropriate asymmetry is implemented in the design of the underlying potential. We develop a quantitative understanding of the variation of the hysteresis loop area and the order parameter with respect to the degree of asymmetry in the potential. Our study suggests an ingenious way to get the desired outputs in the processes related to dynamic hysteresis by effectively controlling the asymmetry of the intrinsic potential governing the dynamics. These findings not only direct a new and impactful path for technological advances involving hysteresis but also provide the basic understanding of the precise role of the underlying potential in regulating this fundamental process, which manifests frequently in natural and designed systems."}

The discussion that followed has emphasized a basic point: writing down coordinate maps is not the same thing as providing a physical theory. In particular, quantum superposition is not operationally defined by drawing multiple paths on paper: it is defined by what happens when alternatives recombine in an interference loop [2, 3]. In parallel, careful 1+1 analyses have clarified how sign conventions and time-orientation choices enter the superluminal formulas [4]. Finally, tachyonic QFT proposals suggest a possible mathematical bridge via an enlarged (twin) Hilbert space [5], although this proposal remains contested (e.g., on commutator covariance and microcausality grounds) [6]. The aim of this short note is organizational. We keep three layers separate: (K) kinematics (which maps exist and what they preserve), (O) operational content (what an experiment must actually reproduce, especially closed-loop interference), and (D/B) dynamics and bridges (how amplitudes and probabilities are generated, and how subluminal and superluminal sectors might be linked). The goal is not relativity derives quantum theory, but a clear checklist of what must be added for that ambition to become a well-posed programme."}

Neutron diffraction measurements reveal a distinct collinear spin alignment, whereas spectroscopic analyses reveal inherent structural vacancies at both Cr and Te sites. These vacancies lead to local symmetry breaking that elevates the orbital degeneracy of the Cr 3$d$ states, as demonstrated by our first-principles analysis. The resulting modification of magnetocrystalline anisotropy emerges as the key mechanism stabilising the collinear magnetic ground state over the non-collinear one in the presence of vacancies.

Through controlled ablations across four clinical prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that explicit time encodings provide no consistent statistically significant benefit for the evaluated downstream tasks. Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters. Larger clinical encoders provide consistent improvements across tasks, benefiting from frozen embeddings that eliminate computational overhead. Our controlled evaluation enables fairer tokenization comparisons and demonstrates that simpler, parameter-efficient approaches can, in many cases, achieve strong performance, though the optimal tokenization strategy remains task-dependent."}

The moiré potential narrows minibands near the Fermi level, resulting in additional peaks in the density of states, whose separation is controlled by $δ$.

We hypothesize that combining pre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs) with Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) can retain high predictive accuracy even when labeled data are scarce. We evaluated two SSL strategies, Self-training and Label Spreading, against fully supervised baselines using four PLM-derived embeddings (ESM-2, ProtVec, ProtT5, ProtBert) applied to haemagglutinin (HA) sequences. A nested cross-validation framework simulated low-label regimes (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% label availability) across four IAV subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H9N2). SSL consistently improved performance under label scarcity. Self-training with ProtVec produced the largest relative gains, showing that SSL can compensate for lower-resolution representations. ESM-2 remained highly robust, achieving F1 scores above 0.82 with only 25% labeled data, indicating that its embeddings capture key antigenic determinants. While H1N1 and H9N2 were predicted with high accuracy, the hypervariable H3N2 subtype remained challenging, although SSL mitigated the performance decline. These findings demonstrate that integrating PLMs with SSL can address the antigenicity labeling bottleneck and enable more effective use of unlabeled surveillance sequences, supporting rapid variant prioritization and timely vaccine strain selection."}

In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I.

That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself. Therefore, no algorithm (and thus no A.I. model) can be truly creative in any field of study, whether that is science, engineering, art, sports, etc. In contrast, A.I. models can demonstrate existing functional capabilities, as well as combinations and permutations of existing functional capabilities. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of this proof both as it regards to the future of A.I. development, as well as to what it means for the origins of human intelligence."}

Aiming to unveil the mechanism behind the onset of incommensurate charge order in layered materials, we study a half-filled, four-band tight-binding model on a ladder with a relative shift $δ=p/q$ between the legs, induced by the dimerization of one of them. The shift results in a moiré supercell comprising q composite cells and a modulated inter-leg tunneling. The moiré potential compresses the leg bands into flat minibands near the Fermi level, resulting in additional low-energy peaks in the density of states. Including Coulomb interactions, we find an incommensurate charge-density-wave phase in which the charge modulation is out of phase between the legs. The collective excitations of this state are long-lived neutral, acoustic phasons whose speed is controlled by the moiré parameter $δ$ and the inter-leg tunneling amplitude.

We investigate the possibility of geometric control of the population growth by compensating the proliferation of particles due to branching events by their absorptions in the bulk or on boundary absorbing regions. We identify an appropriate Steklov spectral problem to obtain the phase diagram of this out-of-equilibrium stochastic process. The principal eigenvalue determines the critical line that separates an exponential growth of the population from its extinction. In other words, we establish a powerful tool for calculating the optimal absorption rate that equilibrates the opposite effects of branching and absorption events and thus results in steady-state behavior of this diffusion-reaction system. Moreover, we show the existence of a critical catalytic rate above which no compensation is possible, so that the population cannot be controlled and keeps growing exponentially. The proposed framework opens promising perspectives for better understanding, modeling and control of various boundary-catalytic branching processes, with applications in physics and life sciences."}

This topological magnetoelectric response, encoded in the spin magnetoelectric polarizability and its closely related spin multipolization, occurs when the electronic structure of the antiferromagnetic insulator is described by massive 2D Dirac fermions, and is therefore native to 2D, unlike the topological magnetoelectric effect of three-dimensional topological insulators. To demonstrate the topological contribution to the (spin) magnetoelectric polarizability, we compute the magnetoelectric polarizability microscopically for two distinct minimal lattice models: a spin-orbit coupled Néel antiferromagnet and a spin-orbit-free noncollinear antiferromagnet with double-$Q$ spin order. We show that the topological origin of the revealed magnetoelectric effect can be traced back to the electromagnetic response of topological semimetals in two dimensions, and hence is ultimately governed by a strong topological invariant in one dimension. Given this dimensional hierarchy, we further consider two minimal lattice models in one dimension, both one-dimensional variants of the 2D lattice models, and show that the magnetoelectric polarizability exhibits a clear signature of nontrivial crystalline topology.

Similar to the propagation-aggregation methodology, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) algorithm tests isomorphism through color refinement according to color representations of a node and its neighbor nodes. However, 1-WL does not leverage any edge features (labels), presenting a potential improvement on exploiting edge features in some fields. To address this limitation, we proposed a novel Edged-WL algorithm (E-WL) which extends the original 1-WL algorithm to incorporate edge features. Building upon the E-WL algorithm, we also introduce an Edged Graph Isomorphism Network (EGIN) model for further exploiting edge features, which addresses one key drawback in many GNNs that do not utilize any edge features of graph data. We evaluated the performance of proposed models using 12 edge-featured benchmark graph datasets and compared them with some state-of-the-art baseline models.

As healthcare systems become more complex, the need for autonomous, context-aware clinical reasoning frameworks has become urgent. We present MCP-AI, a novel architecture for explainable medical decision-making built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP) a modular, executable specification for orchestrating generative and descriptive AI agents in real-time workflows. Each MCP file captures clinical objectives, patient context, reasoning state, and task logic, forming a reusable and auditable memory object. Unlike conventional CDSS or stateless prompt-based AI systems, MCP-AI supports adaptive, longitudinal, and collaborative reasoning across care settings. MCP-AI is validated through two use cases: (1) diagnostic modeling of Fragile X Syndrome with comorbid depression, and (2) remote coordination for Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension. In either scenario, the protocol facilitates physician-in-the-loop validation, streamlines clinical processes, and guarantees secure transitions of AI responsibilities between healthcare providers.

We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\\tt ibm\\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations. The framework presented here generalizes straightforwardly to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics."}

This model transforms drug-miRNA associations into graphs, employs Word2Vec for embedding features of drug molecular structures and miRNA base structures, and leverages a graph transformer model to learn from embedded features and relational structures, ultimately predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. To evaluate DMAGT, we tested its performance on three datasets composed of drug-miRNA associations: ncDR, RNAInter, and SM2miR, achieving up to AUC of $95.24\\pm0.05$.

To operationalize it, we introduce a preliminary version of the Akrasia Benchmark, currently a structured set of prompting conditions (Baseline [B], Synonym [S], Temporal [T], and Temptation [X]) that measures when a model's local response contradicts its own prior commitments. The benchmark enables quantitative comparison of \"self-control\" across model families, decoding strategies, and temptation types. Beyond single-model evaluation, we outline how micro-level akrasia may compound into macro-level instability in multi-agent systems that may be interpreted as \"scheming\" or deliberate misalignment.

Of particular interest for near-term demonstrations of quantum computational advantage are analog quantum simulations, which employ analog controls instead of digitized gates. Most analog quantum simulations to date, however, have been performed using qubit-based processors, despite the fact that many physical systems are more naturally represented in terms of qudits (i.e., $d$-level systems). Motivated by this, we present an experimental realization of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using an analog simulator based on a single superconducting transmon qudit with up to $d = 9$ levels. This is accomplished by moving to a rotated frame in which evolution under any time-dependent local field and one-axis twisting can be realized by the application of multiple simultaneous drives. Combining this analog drive scheme with universal control and single-shot readout of the qudit state, we provide a detailed study of five finite-size precursors of quantum criticality in the LMG model: dynamical phase transitions, closing of the energy gap, Kibble-Zurek-like dynamics, statistics of the order parameter, and excited-state phase transitions. For each experiment we devise a protocol for extracting the relevant properties which does not require any prior knowledge of the system eigenstates, and can therefore be readily extended to higher dimensions or more complicated models. Our results cement high-dimensional transmon qudits as an exciting path towards simulating many-body physics."}

The Actor is instantiated in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a Mahalanobis-weighted operator-valued kernel, while the Value Critic and Advantage Critic reside in scalar RKHSs. These RKHS-enhanced components use sparsified dictionaries: the Value Critic maintains its own dictionary, while the Actor and Advantage Critic share one. State attributions, computed from the Value Critic via RKHS--SHAP (kernel mean embedding for on-manifold expectations and conditional mean embedding for off-manifold expectations), are converted into Mahalanobis-gated weights that modulate Actor gradients and Advantage Critic targets. Theoretically, we derive a global, non-asymptotic convergence bound under state perturbations, showing stability through the perturbation-error term and efficiency through the convergence-error term. Empirical results on three standard continuous-control environments show that our algorithm achieves efficiency, stability, and interpretability."}

Therefore, we propose a Multi-rationale INtegrated Discriminative (MIND) reasoning framework, which is designed to endow MLLMs with human-like cognitive abilities of \"Understand -> Rethink -> Correct\", and achieves a paradigm evolution from passive imitation-based reasoning to active discriminative reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a Rationale Augmentation and Discrimination (RAD) paradigm, which automatically and efficiently expands existing datasets by generating diverse rationales, providing a unified and extensible data foundation. Meanwhile, we design a Progressive Two-stage Correction Learning (P2CL) strategy. The first phase enhances multi-rationale positive learning, while the second phase enables active logic discrimination and correction. In addition, to mitigate representation entanglement in the multi-rationale semantic space, we propose a Multi-rationale Contrastive Alignment (MCA) optimization strategy, which achieves semantic aggregation of correct reasoning and boundary separation of incorrect reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIND reasoning framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets covering scientific, commonsense, and mathematical scenarios.

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%. Despite requiring numerical integration at inference, CFO achieves competitive efficiency, outperforming autoregressive baselines using only 50% of their function evaluations, while uniquely enabling reverse-time inference and arbitrary temporal querying."}

Final doctoral thesis version containing modifications suggested by the referees: Marco G. Genoni, Madalin Guta, and Lukasz Cywinski", "summary": "Quantum entanglement, in the form of spin squeezing, is known to improve the sensitivity of atomic sensors to static or slowly varying fields. Sensing transient events presents a distinct challenge, requires different analysis tools, and has not been shown to benefit from entanglement in practically important scenarios such as spin-precession magnetometry. To address this, we apply concepts from continuous quantum measurements and estimation theory to optical atomic magnetometers, aiming to accurately model these devices, interpret their measurement data, control their dynamics, and achieve optimal sensitivity. Quantifying this optimal performance requires determining a fundamental quantum limit on sensitivity. We derive this limit, imposed by noise, and show that it scales at best linearly with sensing time and atom number N, ruling out any super-classical scaling. This limit is independent of the initial state, measurement, estimator, and measurement-based feedback, and depends only on the decoherence model and the strength of field fluctuations. Thus, finding an estimator that attains this bound proves the sensing strategy optimal. To approach this limit, we develop a quantum dynamical model scalable with N, based on a co-moving Gaussian approximation of the stochastic master equation, which includes measurement backaction and decoherence. This enables a real-time estimation and control architecture integrating an extended Kalman filter with a linear quadratic regulator. Simulating the magnetometer with our model and EKF+LQR strategy shows that quantum-limited tracking of constant and fluctuating fields is within reach of current atomic magnetometers. Our sensing strategy can also track biologically relevant signals, such as heartbeat-like waveforms, and drive the atomic ensemble into an entangled state, even when the measurement record is used for feedback but later discarded."}

Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields.

Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218. Larger LLMs outperform smaller ones, but smaller models may still be viable for resource-constrained settings. Although performance overall is not high enough to fully automate axiom identification, LLMs can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers with the development and refinement of ontologies."}

Starting from a microscopic Lagrangian for a relativistic electron beam coupled to a single radiation mode, we construct a Keldysh functional integral, perform the large-N rescaling, and integrate out the electronic degrees of freedom. This yields an effective action for the FEL mode in which dispersion, gain, and noise are all generated by a single electronic self-energy built from the current correlations of the beam. For a stationary Gaussian beam, we obtain closed analytic expressions for the retarded and Keldysh components of the self-energy, which directly encode frequency pulling, gain reduction due to energy spread, and the noise spectrum experienced by the field. At low frequency, the theory reduces to a Landau-Ginzburg-Keldysh description of a single complex mode with a mass, growth rate, nonlinearity, and noise strength fully determined by beam current, energy spread, and detuning. In this framework, the FEL threshold appears as a continuous non-equilibrium phase transition in the laser universality class: the coherent field amplitude plays the role of an order parameter, while the amplitude of critical fluctuations is fixed by the microscopic noise kernel. The result is a minimal open quantum field theory analog of Vlasov-Maxwell FEL theory, in which gain, dispersion, and noise arise from a unified self-energy framework rather than from separate phenomenological ingredients."}

PL7 and PL5 exhibit notably stronger PDMR than PL6 as opposed to optical detection, indicating higher ionization efficiency and suitability for electrical readout. Rabi oscillation and two-frequency spectroscopy reveal a previously undiscovered secondary resonance of PL7. We determine the zero-field splitting parameters of PL7 and assign the recently reported PL3a defect to PL7.

Our goal is to design an experience replay mechanism that provides appropriate learning signals to each component by using separate, tailored batches.\n  Methods: We introduce Decoupled Prioritized Experience Replay (DPER), a novel approach that allows independent sampling of transition batches for the Actor and the Critic. DPER can be integrated into any off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithm that operates in continuous control domains. We combine DPER with the state-of-the-art Twin Delayed DDPG algorithm and evaluate its performance across standard continuous control benchmarks.\n  Results: DPER outperforms conventional experience replay strategies such as vanilla experience replay and prioritized experience replay in multiple MuJoCo tasks from the OpenAI Gym suite.\n  Conclusions: Our findings show that decoupling experience replay for Actor and Critic networks can enhance training dynamics and final policy quality.

Our work combines room-temperature randomized benchmarking with a new class of composite pulses that are simultaneously robust to frequency and amplitude, affecting random and systematic errors.

For single-qubit and two-qubit CNOT gate demonstrations in a solid-state nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, we systematically measure an improvement in the error per gate up to a factor of 9. By projecting the application of PUDDING to cryogenic temperatures we show a record two-qubit error per gate of $1.2 \\times 10^{-5}$, corresponding to a fidelity of $99.9988\\%$, far below the thresholds required by surface and color code error correction.

In this paper, we test sensitivity and robustness of an artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting model: NVIDIAs FourCastNetv2 (FCNv2). We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity. Second, we start FCNv2 with fully random initial conditions and observe how the model responds to nonsensical inputs. Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise. With full random initial conditions, the model generates smooth and cohesive forecasts after a few timesteps, implying the models tendency towards stable, smoothed outputs. Our approach is simple and portable to other data-driven AI weather forecasting models."}

We first model the radar deployment problem as an end-to-end task and design deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve it, where we develop integrated neural modules to perceive heatmap information and a brand new reward format. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves coverage comparable to evolutionary algorithms while deploying radars approximately 7,000 times faster.

Nb and Ta pentoxides of three thicknesses are deposited via pulsed laser deposition onto identical coplanar waveguide resonators. The two-level system (TLS) loss in Nb2O5 is determined to be about 30% higher than that of Ta2O5.

However, existing metrics for comparing optimization methods typically do not distinguish between these strategies, which often incur different communication costs in practice. To address this disparity, we introduce a simple and natural model of federated optimization that quantifies communication and local computation complexities. This new model allows for several commonly used client-selection strategies and explicitly associates each with a distinct cost. Within this setting, we propose a new algorithm that achieves the best-known communication and local complexities among existing federated optimization methods for non-convex optimization. This algorithm is based on the inexact composite gradient method with a carefully constructed gradient estimator and a special procedure for solving the auxiliary subproblem at each iteration. The gradient estimator is based on SAGA, a popular variance-reduced gradient estimator. We first derive a new variance bound for it, showing that SAGA can exploit functional similarity. We then introduce the Recursive-Gradient technique as a general way to potentially improve the error bound of a given conditionally unbiased gradient estimator, including both SAGA and SVRG. By applying this technique to SAGA, we obtain a new estimator, RG-SAGA, which has an improved error bound compared to the original one."}

Following correlation between intelligence and system 2 reasoning (slow thinking), in this paper, we aim to answering a worthwhile research question: could machine intelligence such as LLMs be evolved to acquire reasoning ability (not specific skill) just like our human beings? To this end, we propose evolutionary reasoning optimization (ERO) framework which performs survival of the fittest over a population of LLMs to search for individual with strong reasoning ability. Given a reasoning task, ERO first initializes multiple LLMs as a population, after which an evolutionary strategy evolves the population to maximize quantified reasoning score of the best individual. Based on experiments on representative testsuites, we claim two surprising empirical discoveries: i) the latest LLMs such as GPT-5 still show limited system 2 reasoning ability; ii) with simple evolution-loop of ERO, a relatively weak model (Qwen-7B) could be enhanced to emerge powerful reasoning ability.

We argue this conclusion misidentifies the bottleneck: it confuses the ocean with the net. Pattern repositories are the necessary System-1 substrate; the missing component is a System-2 coordination layer that selects, constrains, and binds these patterns. We formalize this layer via UCCT, a theory of semantic anchoring that models reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support (rho_d), representational mismatch (d_r), and an adaptive anchoring budget (gamma log k). Under this lens, ungrounded generation is simply an unbaited retrieval of the substrate's maximum likelihood prior, while \"reasoning\" emerges when anchors shift the posterior toward goal-directed constraints. We translate UCCT into architecture with MACI, a coordination stack that implements baiting (behavior-modulated debate), filtering (Socratic judging), and persistence (transactional memory). By reframing common objections as testable coordination failures, we argue that the path to AGI runs through LLMs, not around them."}

While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks. Under TT structured model and distribution tensors, we show that IT SHAP reduces the exponential complex Theta(4^n) of STII to NC2 parallel time. These results demonstrate that IT SHAP provides a unified, axiomatic, and computationally tractable formulation of main effects and higher order interactions in high dimensional models. This framework establishes a foundation for scalable interaction aware explainable AI, with implications for large black box models whose combinatorial structure has previously rendered interaction analysis infeasible."}

In this approach we consider all possible configurations in the surroundings of a local observable, and unique samples from the remaining of the setup drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We have tested the performance of this approach for ground states of the spin-1/2 tilted Ising model in different phases, and also for thermal states in the a spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model.

We annotated 3364 psychological processes and their corresponding dimensions in therapy transcripts. Using these data, we applied in-context learning to jointly identify psychological processes and their dimensions. The method achieved high performance even with a few training examples. To organize the processes into networks, we introduced a two-step method that grouped them into clinically meaningful clusters. We then generated explanation-augmented relationships between clusters. Experts found that networks produced by our multi-step approach outperformed those built with direct prompting for clinical utility and interpretability, with up to 90% preferring our approach.

We intentionally exclude subjective considerations such as novelty, importance, or writing quality. We find that published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time-from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3% increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes identified by the AI Checker and confirmed that 263 were actual mistakes, corresponding to a precision of 83.2%. While most identified issues are relatively minor, correcting them would reduce confusion in the literature and strengthen reproducibility. The AI Checker also surfaced potentially more substantive mistakes that could affect the interpretation of results. Moreover, we show that the AI Checker can propose correct fixes for 75.8% of the identified mistakes. Overall, this study highlights the potential of frontier LLMs to detect and correct objective mistakes in published papers, helping to establish a firmer foundation of knowledge."}

Promising transducers use a mechanical intermediary that couples to both fields via radiation pressure. Such electro-optomechanical devices have achieved high efficiencies, yet require resolved-sideband cavities, and generally compromise in scalability and noise performance. Here, we relax this constraint by extending the protocol of Navarathna et al. that transfers optical quantum information onto a mechanical resonator using a broadband, sideband-unresolved cavity and feedback. Combining this with parametric mechanical-to-microwave conversion, we show that continuous optical-to-microwave quantum state transfer is possible using measurement-based feedback, while all-optical coherent feedback enables bidirectional transfer. To assess the transfer, we introduce the quantum transfer witness $\\mathcal{W}_T$, which -- though similar to the input-referred added noise -- also identifies whether a channel is capable of both preserving Gaussian entanglement and outperforming classical transduction schemes. Finally, we show that quantum-compatible noise performance is within reach of current experimental capabilities. Our results unlock a new design space for electro-optomechanical transducers and strengthens their candidacy as scalable quantum links between distant nodes."}

These domains demand conceptual understanding, symbolic reasoning, and adherence to formal laws, requirements that most existing benchmarks fail to address. In particular, current datasets tend to be static, lacking intermediate reasoning steps, robustness to variations, or mechanisms for verifying scientific correctness. To address these limitations, we introduce PRiSM, a synthetic, fully dynamic, and multimodal benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning via grounded Python code. PRiSM includes over 24,750 university-level physics and math problems, and it leverages our scalable agent-based pipeline, PrismAgent, to generate well-structured problem instances. Each problem contains dynamic textual and visual input, a generated figure, alongside rich structured outputs: executable Python code for ground truth generation and verification, and detailed step-by-step reasoning. The dynamic nature and Python-powered automated ground truth generation of our benchmark allow for fine-grained experimental auditing of multimodal VLMs, revealing failure modes, uncertainty behaviors, and limitations in scientific reasoning. To this end, we propose five targeted evaluation tasks covering generalization, symbolic program synthesis, perturbation robustness, reasoning correction, and ambiguity resolution. Through comprehensive evaluation of existing VLMs, we highlight their limitations and showcase how PRiSM enables deeper insights into their scientific reasoning capabilities."}

We propose an observability architecture tailored for QCSC workflows that decouples telemetry collection from workload execution, enabling persistent monitoring across system and algorithmic layers and retaining detailed execution data for reproducible and retrospective analysis, eliminating redundant runs. Applied to a representative workflow involving sample-based quantum diagonalization, our system reveals solver behavior across multiple iterations.

Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines."}

Here we propose a method to address this issue by employing a classical photodiode to compensate for the laser frequency difference. As an application of this method, we implement this technique in a mode-pairing QKD system, achieving an error rate approaching the theoretical limit and surpassing the linear key-rate bound over a fiber distance of 296.8 km. This approach provides a practical solution for frequency matching between independent lasers and can be extended to other fields requiring precise phase stabilization."}

A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models."}

In order to compensate for the deviation from the initial conditions, the classical parameters of the system Hamiltonian are affected by the actuator output of a measurement-based classical controller. The latter uses an observation process produced by a measuring apparatus from the quantum output field of the memory system. The underlying system is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator whose Heisenberg evolution is governed by linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations. The controller is organised as a classical linear time-varying system, so that the resulting closed-loop system has quantum and classical dynamic variables. We apply linear-quadratic-Gaussian control and fixed-point smoothing at the level of the first two moments and consider controllers with a separation structure which involve a continuously updated estimate for the initial quantum variables. The initial-point smoother is used for actuator signal formation so as to minimise the sum of a mean-square deviation of the quantum memory system variables at a given time horizon from their initial values and an integral quadratic penalty on the control signal."}

We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year.

MVC compensates for the shortcomings of single-view methods and provides a richer data representation and effective solutions for a variety of unsupervised learning tasks. In contrast to traditional single-view approaches, the semantically rich nature of multi-view data increases its practical utility despite its inherent complexity.

In discrete, odd-dimensional systems (qudits), protocols involving only non-negative phase space distributions can be efficiently classically simulated. For bosonic systems, defined in continuous variables, phase space negativities are likewise necessary to prevent efficient classical simulation of the underlying physical processes. However, when quantum information is encoded in bosonic systems, this connection becomes subtler: as negativity is only a necessary property for potential quantum advantage, encoding (i.e., physical) states may exhibit large negativities while still corresponding to architectures that remain classically simulable. Several frameworks have attempted to relate non-negativity of states and gates in the computational phase space to non-negativity of processes in the physical bosonic phase space, but a consistent correspondence remains elusive. Here, we introduce a general framework that connects the physical phase space structure of bosonic systems to their encoded computational representations across arbitrary dimensions and encodings. This framework highlights the key role of the reference frame-equivalently, the choice of vacuum-in defining the computational basis and linking its phase space simulability properties to those of the physical system.

Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms."}

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%. Despite requiring numerical integration at inference, CFO achieves competitive efficiency, outperforming autoregressive baselines using only 50% of their function evaluations, while uniquely enabling reverse-time inference and arbitrary temporal querying."}

Existing randomness analysis lacks rigorous adversarial models and a clear characterization of the role of quantum coherence in these systems. In this work, we develop a comprehensive quantum information-theoretic framework for randomness generation in spontaneous emission processes. We characterize two distinct eavesdropping strategies: one where the adversary directly accesses the atom ensemble, and the other where the adversary accesses only its purification. Our analysis reveals that when randomness is generated through single-photon detection and temporal mode measurements, the QRNG is vulnerable to the first adversary scenario, though it still guarantees a lower bound on intrinsic randomness against the second adversary scenario even under maximal information leakage from the atoms. In contrast, QRNGs based on spatial mode detection and phase fluctuations demonstrate security against both types of adversaries, providing robust randomness generation. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative calculation of intrinsic randomness for these spontaneous-emission-based QRNG schemes."}

We introduce and analyze assisted quantum erasure, where correlations with a remote system reduce the energetic cost of resetting a memory. We identify exclusive control of erasure as the central operational requirement: only a designated party should be able to achieve the minimal cost, while any adversary necessarily fails. In the device-dependent regime, we show that entanglement of formation exactly characterizes exclusivity, establishing entanglement as the decisive thermodynamic resource. Moving to a one-sided device-independent scenario, in which only the memory holder's device is trusted, we develop an operational erasure protocol based on random dephasing and conditional operations. These results elevate quantum erasure from a thermodynamic constraint to an operational primitive: the erasure work cost quantifies secure, exclusive control over quantum memory, guaranteeing that an unauthorized agent cannot fully erase information under bounded work."}

However, issues such as missing values and anomalies in sequential data hinder its further development in prediction tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting feature information from sequence data or addressing these suboptimal data as positive samples for knowledge transfer. A more effective approach would be to leverage these non-ideal negative samples to enhance event prediction. In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative sample data unlocks significant potential within the basic attention architecture for time series forecasting. Therefore, IdealTSF is particularly well-suited for applications with noisy samples or low-quality data."}

In this paper, we test sensitivity and robustness of an artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting model: NVIDIAs FourCastNetv2 (FCNv2). We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity. Second, we start FCNv2 with fully random initial conditions and observe how the model responds to nonsensical inputs. Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise. With full random initial conditions, the model generates smooth and cohesive forecasts after a few timesteps, implying the models tendency towards stable, smoothed outputs. Our approach is simple and portable to other data-driven AI weather forecasting models."}

This method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques such as tensor networks, but avoids introducing systematic errors due to truncation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space associated with superconducting phases. The approach is applied to fluxonium, a specific many-component superconducting qubit with favorable qualities for quantum computation. A systematic study of the influence of impedance on fluxonium is conducted that parallels previous experimental studies, and ground capacitance effects are explored. The qubit frequency and charge noise dephasing rate are extracted from statistical analyses of charge noise, where thousands of instantiations of charge disorder in the Josephson junction array of a fixed fluxonium qubit are explicitly averaged over at the microscopic level. This is difficult to achieve with any other existing method."}

This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud. Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively. Overall, the study provides a clear view of how and when ensembles maintain high accuracy while keeping overfitting low, offering practical guidance for model selection in real world tabular applications."}

While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks. Under TT structured model and distribution tensors, we show that IT SHAP reduces the exponential complex Theta(4^n) of STII to NC2 parallel time. These results demonstrate that IT SHAP provides a unified, axiomatic, and computationally tractable formulation of main effects and higher order interactions in high dimensional models. This framework establishes a foundation for scalable interaction aware explainable AI, with implications for large black box models whose combinatorial structure has previously rendered interaction analysis infeasible."}

We introduce a continuous-time extension of multi-time quantum processes based on process and operation functionals, which generalize the Feynman-Vernon influence functional and yield a continuous Born rule that cleanly separates processes from operations. This framework provides a consistent representation of non-Markovian dynamics under continuous monitoring and leads to a natural definition of Markovianity in continuous time. We illustrate the formalism by analyzing continuous measurements in a generalized Caldeira-Leggett model, demonstrating its applicability to realistic non-Markovian scenarios."}

Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines."}

Although narrowband techniques can probe specific resonances with high precision, a broadband spectroscopic approach captures the full spectrum of defect properties and dynamics. Two-level system (TLS) defects in amorphous dielectrics are a particularly important example because they are major sources of decoherence and energy loss in superconducting quantum devices. However, accessing and characterizing their collective dynamics remains far more challenging than probing individual TLS defects. Building on our previously developed Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS) technique, we study the coherent control and time-resolved dynamics of TLS defect ensembles over a wide frequency range of 3-5 GHz without requiring full device fabrication, revealing quantum interference effects, memory-dependent dynamics, and dressed-state evolution within the TLS defect bath. The spectral response reveals distinct V-shaped structures corresponding to the bare eigenmode frequencies. Using these features, we extract a TLS defect spectral density of 84 GHz^-1 for a silicon sample, across a 4.1-4.6 GHz span. Furthermore, we systematically investigate amplitude- and phase-controlled interference fringes for multiple temperatures and inter-pulse delays, providing direct evidence of coherent dynamics and control. A driven minimal spin model with dipole-dipole interactions that qualitatively capture the observed behavior is presented. Our results establish BCTDS as a versatile platform for broadband defect spectroscopy, offering new capabilities for diagnosing and mitigating sources of decoherence, engineering many-body dynamics, and exploring non-equilibrium phenomena in disordered quantum systems."}

A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables.

We introduce a multifidelity learning framework that corrects coarse quantum solutions to high-fidelity accuracy using sparse classical training data, facilitating the path toward practical quantum utility for scientific computing. The approach trains a low-fidelity surrogate on abundant quantum solver outputs, then learns correction mappings through a multifidelity neural architecture that balances linear and nonlinear transformations. Demonstrated on benchmark nonlinear PDEs including viscous Burgers equation and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows via quantum lattice Boltzmann methods, the framework successfully corrects coarse quantum predictions and achieves temporal extrapolation well beyond the classical training window. This strategy illustrates how one can reduce expensive high-fidelity simulation requirements while producing predictions that are competitive with classical accuracy.

CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties.

Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift.

Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa. These results indicate that MineROI-Net offers a practical, data-driven tool for timing mining hardware acquisitions, potentially reducing financial risk in capital-intensive mining operations.

However, issues such as missing values and anomalies in sequential data hinder its further development in prediction tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting feature information from sequence data or addressing these suboptimal data as positive samples for knowledge transfer. A more effective approach would be to leverage these non-ideal negative samples to enhance event prediction. In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative sample data unlocks significant potential within the basic attention architecture for time series forecasting. Therefore, IdealTSF is particularly well-suited for applications with noisy samples or low-quality data."}

This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud. Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively. Overall, the study provides a clear view of how and when ensembles maintain high accuracy while keeping overfitting low, offering practical guidance for model selection in real world tabular applications."}

First, there is no guarantee that they can capture consistent neighbors well, especially when the same neighbors are in regions of varied densities in different views, resulting in inferior detection accuracy. Second, the learning process has a high computational cost of $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, rendering them inapplicable for large datasets.

However, the off-policy training paradigm introduces distribution shift, which often pushes the policy beyond the trust region, leading to training instabilities manifested as fluctuations in policy entropy and unstable gradients. Although PPO-Clip mitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \\textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability of PPO-clip to regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions.

Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem.

Code available at: https://github.com/charliezchen/scaling-matrix-preconditioning", "summary": "Several recently introduced deep learning optimizers utilizing matrix-level preconditioning have shown promising speedups relative to the current dominant optimizer AdamW, particularly in relatively small-scale experiments. However, efforts to validate and replicate their successes have reported mixed results. To better understand the effectiveness of these optimizers at scale, in this work we investigate how to scale preconditioned optimizers via hyperparameter transfer, building on prior works such as $μ$P. We study how the optimal learning rate and weight decay should scale with model width and depth for a wide range of optimizers, including Shampoo, SOAP, and Muon, accounting for the impact of commonly used techniques such as blocking and grafting. We find that scaling the learning rate according to $μ$P improves transfer, but can still suffer from significant finite-width deviations that cause drifting optimal learning rates, which we show can be mitigated by blocking and explicit spectral normalization. For compute-optimal scaling, we find scaling independent weight decay as $1/\\mathrm{width}$ is nearly optimal across optimizers. Applying these scaling rules, we show Muon and Shampoo consistently achieve $1.4\\times$ and $1.3\\times$ speedup over AdamW for training Llama-architecture language models of sizes ranging from $190$M to $1.4$B, whereas the speedup vanishes rapidly with scale under incorrect scaling. Based on these results and further ablations, we argue that studying optimal hyperparameter transfer is essential for reliably comparing optimizers at scale given a realistic tuning budget."}

Such evaluations quantify how well a function behaves on a distribution, but they do not address whether the internal decomposition of a model is uniquely determined by the data and evaluation design. In this paper, we introduce \\emph{Modular Jets} for regression and classification pipelines. Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map. We then present an algorithm (MoJet) for empirical jet estimation and mirage diagnostics, and illustrate the framework using linear and deep regression as well as pipeline classification."}

While data filtering has emerged as a pretraining-time mitigation, it faces significant challenges: labeling whether data is harmful is expensive at scale, and given improving sample efficiency with larger models, even small amounts of mislabeled content could give rise to dangerous capabilities. To address risks associated with mislabeled harmful content, prior work proposed Gradient Routing (Cloud et al., 2024) -- a technique that localizes target knowledge into a dedicated subset of model parameters so they can later be removed. We explore an improved variant of Gradient Routing, which we call Selective GradienT Masking (SGTM), with particular focus on evaluating its robustness to label noise. SGTM zero-masks selected gradients such that target domain examples only update their dedicated parameters. We test SGTM's effectiveness in two applications: removing knowledge of one language from a model trained on a bilingual synthetic dataset, and removing biology knowledge from a model trained on English Wikipedia. In both cases SGTM provides better retain/forget trade-off in the presence of labeling errors compared to both data filtering and a previously proposed instantiation of Gradient Routing. Unlike shallow unlearning approaches that can be quickly undone through fine-tuning, SGTM exhibits strong robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, requiring seven times more fine-tuning steps to reach baseline performance on the forget set compared to a finetuning-based unlearning method (RMU). Our results suggest SGTM provides a promising pretraining-time complement to existing safety mitigations, particularly in settings where label noise is unavoidable."}

However, large codebooks and effects caused by reflections or blockages of beams make an optimal beam selection challenging.

However, it remains an open question of how to best determine which of the many possible model checkpoints resulting from a large training run to use as the starting point. This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency. We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings. Our approach significantly improves generalization across these different target domains compared to established baselines.

Sensors fail, records are inconsistent, and datasets collected from different sources often differ in scale, sampling rate, and quality. These differences create missing values that make it difficult to combine data and build reliable models. Standard imputation methods such as regression models, expectation-maximization, and multiple imputation rely on strong assumptions about linearity and independence. These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data. This adversarial process allows Impugan to capture nonlinear and multimodal relationships that conventional methods cannot represent. In experiments on benchmark datasets and a multi-source integration task, Impugan achieves up to 82\\% lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and 70\\% lower mutual-information deviation (MI) compared to leading baselines.

Second, they enable holistic atom-to-atom mapping that tracks all atoms, including hydrogens. Third, they extract catalyst-aware reaction templates that distinguish recycled catalysts from spectator species. By grounding predictions in physically meaningful electron moves that ensure conservation of mass and charge, this work provides a pathway toward more explainable and chemically valid computational synthesis planning, while providing an architecture-agnostic framework for the benchmarking of mechanism prediction."}

We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the \"mode-seeking\" or \"zero-forcing\" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on certain high-probability regions of the target while neglecting others. In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $α$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences.

These effective learning rates act as multiplicative filters that control both the magnitude and anisotropy of gradient transport. Under heavy-tailed ($α$-stable) gradient noise, we prove that the minimal sample size required to detect a dependency at lag~$\\ell$ satisfies $N(\\ell)\\propto f(\\ell)^{-α}$, where $f(\\ell)=\\|μ_{t,\\ell}\\|_1$ is the effective learning rate envelope. This leads to an explicit formula for $\\mathcal{H}_N$ and closed-form scaling laws for logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential decay of $f(\\ell)$.

Despite rapid empirical progress, its theoretical foundations remain limited: existing methods (gradient, distribution, trajectory matching) are built on heterogeneous surrogate objectives and optimization assumptions, which makes it difficult to analyze their common principles or provide general guarantees. Moreover, it is still unclear under what conditions distilled data can retain the effectiveness of full datasets when the training configuration, such as optimizer, architecture, or augmentation, changes. To answer these questions, we propose a unified theoretical framework, termed configuration--dynamics--error analysis, which reformulates major DD approaches under a common generalization-error perspective and provides two main results: (i) a scaling law that provides a single-configuration upper bound, characterizing how the error decreases as the distilled sample size increases and explaining the commonly observed performance saturation effect; and (ii) a coverage law showing that the required distilled sample size scales linearly with configuration diversity, with provably matching upper and lower bounds. In addition, our unified analysis reveals that various matching methods are interchangeable surrogates, reducing the same generalization error, clarifying why they can all achieve dataset distillation and providing guidance on how surrogate choices affect sample efficiency and robustness. Experiments across diverse methods and configurations empirically confirm the derived laws, advancing a theoretical foundation for DD and enabling theory-driven design of compact, configuration-robust dataset distillation."}

However, it remains an open question of how to best determine which of the many possible model checkpoints resulting from a large training run to use as the starting point. This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency. We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings. Our approach significantly improves generalization across these different target domains compared to established baselines. We further demonstrate the versatility of Neural Coherence as a powerful principle by showing its effectiveness in training data selection."}

Rather, they minimize the constraint violations in a soft way. Strict satisfaction of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to embed domain knowledge and first-principles in data-driven models is generally challenging. This is because data-driven models consider the original functions to be black-box whose derivatives can only be obtained after evaluating the functions. We introduce DAE-HardNet, a physics-constrained (rather than simply physics-informed) neural network that learns both the functions and their derivatives simultaneously, while enforcing algebraic as well as differential constraints. This is done by projecting model predictions onto the constraint manifold using a differentiable projection layer. We apply DAE-HardNet to several systems and test problems governed by DAEs, including the dynamic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system and transient heat conduction. We also show the ability of DAE-HardNet to estimate unknown parameters through a parameter estimation problem. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and PINNs, DAE-HardNet achieves orders of magnitude reduction in the physics loss while maintaining the prediction accuracy. It has the added benefits of learning the derivatives which improves the constrained learning of the backbone neural network prior to the projection layer. For specific problems, this suggests that the projection layer can be bypassed for faster inference. The current implementation and codes are available at https://github.com/SOULS-TAMU/DAE-HardNet."}

Simultaneously, controlling the Lipschitz constant in neural networks has emerged as an essential area of research to enhance adversarial robustness and network certifiability. This paper presents a rigorous approach to the general design of $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz deep residual networks using a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) framework. Initially, the ResNet architecture was reformulated as a cyclic tridiagonal LMI, and closed-form constraints on network parameters were derived to ensure $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz continuity; however, using a new $LDL^\\top$ decomposition approach for certifying LMI feasibility, we extend the construction of $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipchitz networks to any other nonlinear architecture. Our contributions include a provable parameterization methodology for constructing Lipschitz-constrained residual networks and other hierarchical architectures. Cholesky decomposition is also used for efficient parameterization. These findings enable robust network designs applicable to adversarial robustness, certified training, and control systems. The $LDL^\\top$ formulation is shown to be a tight relaxation of the SDP-based network, maintaining full expressiveness and achieving 3\\%-13\\% accuracy gains over SLL Layers on 121 UCI data sets."}

Yet, as sequence length and batch size grow, the cache becomes a major memory bottleneck. Prior compression methods typically apply low-rank decomposition to keys alone or attempt to jointly embed queries and keys, but both approaches neglect that attention fundamentally depends on their inner products. In this work, we prove that such strategies are suboptimal for approximating the attention matrix. We introduce KQ-SVD, a simple and computationally efficient method that directly performs an optimal low-rank decomposition of the attention matrix via a closed-form solution. By targeting the true source of redundancy, KQ-SVD preserves attention outputs with higher fidelity under compression. Extensive evaluations on LLaMA and Mistral models demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers superior projection quality."}

An emerging approach to address this problem relies on \\emph{disagreement discrepancy} -- a measure of how the disagreement between two models changes under a shifting distribution. The process of maximizing this measure has seen applications in bounding error under shifts, testing for harmful shifts, and training more robust models. However, this optimization involves the non-differentiable zero-one loss, necessitating the use of practical surrogate losses. We prove that existing surrogates for disagreement discrepancy are not Bayes consistent, revealing a fundamental flaw: maximizing these surrogates can fail to maximize the true disagreement discrepancy. To address this, we introduce new theoretical results providing both upper and lower bounds on the optimality gap for such surrogates. Guided by this theory, we propose a novel disagreement loss that, when paired with cross-entropy, yields a provably consistent surrogate for disagreement discrepancy. Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides more accurate and robust estimates of disagreement discrepancy than existing approaches, particularly under challenging adversarial conditions."}

However, large increases in computing power and the greater availability of Big Data have dramatically increased the probability of re-identifying anonymized data, potentially violating the pledge of confidentiality given to survey respondents. Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data. Econometric replication of a high impact analysis published in Small Business Economics demonstrates the verisimilitude of the synthetic data to the true data and motivates discussion of possible ABS use cases."}

Sensors fail, records are inconsistent, and datasets collected from different sources often differ in scale, sampling rate, and quality. These differences create missing values that make it difficult to combine data and build reliable models. Standard imputation methods such as regression models, expectation-maximization, and multiple imputation rely on strong assumptions about linearity and independence. These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data. This adversarial process allows Impugan to capture nonlinear and multimodal relationships that conventional methods cannot represent. In experiments on benchmark datasets and a multi-source integration task, Impugan achieves up to 82\\% lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and 70\\% lower mutual-information deviation (MI) compared to leading baselines. These results show that adversarially trained generative models provide a scalable and principled approach for imputing and merging incomplete, heterogeneous data.

MaxShapley is a special case of the celebrated Shapley value; it leverages a decomposable max-sum utility function to compute attributions with linear computation in the number of documents, as opposed to the exponential cost of Shapley values. We evaluate MaxShapley on three multi-hop QA datasets (HotPotQA, MuSiQUE, MS MARCO); MaxShapley achieves comparable attribution quality to exact Shapley computation, while consuming a fraction of its tokens--for instance, it gives up to an 8x reduction in resource consumption over prior state-of-the-art methods at the same attribution accuracy."}

However, growing evidence shows that models trained in such way often suffer from a significant loss in diversity. We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the \"mode-seeking\" or \"zero-forcing\" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on certain high-probability regions of the target while neglecting others. In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $α$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences. On a Lean theorem-proving benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance along the coverage-precision Pareto frontier, outperforming all prior methods on the coverage axis."}

We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings."}

We argue this conclusion misidentifies the bottleneck: it confuses the ocean with the net. Pattern repositories are the necessary System-1 substrate; the missing component is a System-2 coordination layer that selects, constrains, and binds these patterns. We formalize this layer via UCCT, a theory of semantic anchoring that models reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support (rho_d), representational mismatch (d_r), and an adaptive anchoring budget (gamma log k). Under this lens, ungrounded generation is simply an unbaited retrieval of the substrate's maximum likelihood prior, while \"reasoning\" emerges when anchors shift the posterior toward goal-directed constraints. We translate UCCT into architecture with MACI, a coordination stack that implements baiting (behavior-modulated debate), filtering (Socratic judging), and persistence (transactional memory). By reframing common objections as testable coordination failures, we argue that the path to AGI runs through LLMs, not around them."}
