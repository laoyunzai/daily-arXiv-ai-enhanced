Running small-scale ablation experiments on key innovations from this time period, we are able to account for less than 10x of these gains. Surveying the broader literature, we estimate that additional innovations not included in our ablations account for less than 10x, yielding a total under 100x. This leads us to conduct scaling experiments, which reveal that much of this efficiency gap can be explained by algorithms with scale-dependent efficiency improvements. In particular, we conduct scaling experiments between LSTMs and Transformers, finding exponent differences in their compute-optimal scaling law while finding little scaling difference for many other innovations. These experiments demonstrate that - contrary to standard assumptions - an algorithm's efficiency gains are tied to compute scale. Using experimental extrapolation and literature estimates, we account for 6,930x efficiency gains over the same time period, with the scale-dependent LSTM-to-Transformer transition accounting for the majority of gains. Our results indicate that algorithmic progress for small models has been far slower than previously assumed, and that measures of algorithmic efficiency are strongly reference-dependent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c2012-2023\u5e74\u95f4AI\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u768422,000\u500d\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\u4ec5\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u5230100\u500d\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6765\u81ea\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u89c4\u6a21\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LSTM\u5230Transformer\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a762012-2023\u5e74\u95f4AI\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534722,000\u500d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55LSTM\u4e0eTransformer\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\u4ec5\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u5230100\u500d\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u89c4\u6a21\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684LSTM\u5230Transformer\u8f6c\u53d8\u89e3\u91ca\u4e866,930\u500d\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u6a21\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fdc\u6162\u4e8e\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u7684\u8861\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f6c\u53d8\u662f\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u3002"}}

Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.

However, many real-world reasoning-intensive tasks lack verifiers, despite offering abundant expert demonstrations that remain under-utilized for reasoning-focused training. We introduce RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization) that learns strong reasoning capabilities from only expert demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks -- Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing -- and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks.

We demonstrate experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMa models, where we uncover interesting geometric patterns in latent space. Notably, we identify a clear separation between attention and MLP component outputs across intermediate layers, a pattern not documented in prior work to our knowledge. We also characterize the high norm of latent states at the initial sequence position and visualize the layerwise evolution of latent states. Additionally, we demonstrate the high-dimensional helical structure of GPT-2's positional embeddings, the sequence-wise geometric patterns in LLaMa, and experiment with repeating token sequences. We aim to support systematic analysis of Transformer internals with the goal of enabling further reproducible interpretability research.

The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement. Our method occupies a middle ground between fully online and fully offline approaches, retaining the adaptability of online updates while gaining the stability benefits of offline training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u8f6eRLHF\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3PPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ea4\u66ff\u62df\u5408Q\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u8f6eRL\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5730\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5355\u8f6eRLHF\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u591a\u8f6eQ\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5355\u8f6e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3PPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7528\u6807\u51c6token\u7ea7PPO\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u8f6eRL\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u8f6eRLHF\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}
