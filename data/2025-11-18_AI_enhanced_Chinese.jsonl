For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -\u03a3 p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials).

While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($\u03c1$) and head-tail ratio ($\u03b7$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy.

Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7a00\u758f\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u6b21B\u6837\u6761\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u5bfc\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u6b21B\u6837\u6761\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5230\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eB\u6837\u6761\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u5bfc\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7a00\u758f\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors.

Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting.

While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies.

This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large.

Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u7c7b\uff08LPC\uff09\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7279\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86MIP\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u8d2a\u5a6a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u53ef\u5206\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8eMIP\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "1. \u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7279\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\n2. \u5c06LPC\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f2a\u5e03\u5c14\u4f18\u5316\uff08QPBO\uff09\u95ee\u9898\n3. \u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eMIP\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u56de\u5f52\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709MIP\u516c\u5f0f\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LPC\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u5206\u548c\u975e\u53ef\u5206\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation.

Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops.

This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u4e8b\u6545\u524d\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u572839\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8ffd\u5c3e\u78b0\u649e\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u545892%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u91cd\u5efa\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u78b0\u649e\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e8b\u6545\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5f55\u5668\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u4e8b\u6545\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u5904\u7406\u4e86277\u8d77\u8ffd\u5c3e\u524d\u8f66\u51cf\u901f\u78b0\u649e\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u572839\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u78b0\u649e\u6848\u4f8b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u7f8e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u76f8\u5173EDR\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e76\u6b63\u786e\u533a\u5206\u649e\u51fb\u4e0e\u88ab\u649e\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u545892%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u78b0\u649e\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u78b0\u649e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u4e8b\u6545\u524d\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ans\u00e4tze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57288\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178RBF\u6838\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6216\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u6280\u672f\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u57288\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\uff08\u5982RBF\u6838\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u9645\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u5927\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5927\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\u57fa\u8d28\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5f53\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u91cf\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4ece\u4e2a\u4f53\u6c34\u5e73\u89c2\u5bdf\u6784\u5efa\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u6355\u83b7\u5927\u8111\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u751f\u7269\u7ea6\u675f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u961f\u5217\u7684tau-PET\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u989d\u5916\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LLM\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6837\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Reddy"], "title": "SURFACEBENCH: Can Self-Evolving LLMs Find the Equations of 3D Scientific Surfaces?", "comment": null, "summary": "Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench", "AI": {"tldr": "SurfaceBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u66f2\u9762\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b183\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d615\u79cd\u7b26\u53f7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u9690\u5f0f\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u7a0b\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6807\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u66f2\u9762\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4f9d\u8d56\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b183\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684SurfaceBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d615\u79cd\u7b26\u53f7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u7a0b\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u9690\u5f0f\u3001\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u53d8\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5408\u6210\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u66f2\u9762\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u3002SurfaceBench\u4e3a\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "conclusion": "SurfaceBench\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8fde\u63a5\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u5206\u5de5\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u9ad8AI\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728APPl\u6848\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523072%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534721\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\uff08\u5982\u65e5\u672c\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5APPI\uff09\u4e0b\uff0cAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u89c4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u5408\u89c4\u68c0\u67e5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6cd5\u89c4\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4e1a\u52a1\u80cc\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5408\u6210\u534f\u8bae\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728200\u4e2aAPPl\u7b2c16\u6761\u4fee\u6b63\u6848\u6848\u4f8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u523072%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad821\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5728\u660e\u786e\u5408\u89c4\u6848\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523090%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ec516%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u660e\u786e\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cd5\u5f8bAI\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u89c4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual \"knowledge\" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9047\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u5019\u9009\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4eba\u7c7b\u671f\u671b\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4f1a\u9047\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u505a\u51fa\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u671f\u671b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u6240\u9700\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u7c7b\u578b\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8ffd\u6c42\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u671f\u671b\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u6027\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u505a\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u671f\u671b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones.

Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures.

Gent", "Christopher Jefferson"], "title": "Faster Symmetry Breaking Constraints for Abstract Structures", "comment": null, "summary": "In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6253\u7834\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5176\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5d4c\u5957\u96c6\u5408\uff09\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025\uff09\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6253\u7834\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u96c6\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u4e24\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u826f\u597d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u6536\u96c6\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6536\u96c6\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u65b9\u5dee\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u96c6\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, \"Truth Last\", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth.

In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic.

To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%.

Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\\times$ runtime speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u6307\u5bfc\u79c1\u6709\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u68af\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PAZO\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e00\u9636\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8fbe16\u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e00\u9636\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982DP-SGD\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u4f4e\u4e14\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPAZO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5171\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u79c1\u6709\u96f6\u9636\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u8f85\u52a9\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cPAZO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9690\u79c1/\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c24\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8fbe16\u500d\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "PAZO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79c1\u6709\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\\textit{Condition} \\rightarrow \\textit{Actions}$ rules.

To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like \"Who is Undercover?\". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting \"undercover\" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions.

However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6PI-MJCA-BiGRU\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u5173\u8282\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u5173\u8282\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757(MJCA)\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u5411\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143(BiGRU)\u5c42\u6765\u6355\u6349\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u5173\u8282\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u8026\u5408\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u529b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5d4c\u5165\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cPI-MJCA-BiGRU\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0cMJCA\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u5907\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "STaR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6162\u601d\u8003\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3aLLMs\u7684\u8868\u683c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u8868\u683c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTaR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u9010\u6b65\u601d\u8003\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u589e\u5f3aLLMs\u7684\u6162\u601d\u8003\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "STaR\u4e3aLLMs\u8868\u683c\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance.

There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.\n  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision.

Code will be available", "summary": "Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with \"the right to be forgotten\" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "GraphToxin\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u5df2\u5220\u9664\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u94fe\u63a5\u53ca\u654f\u611f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u867d\u7136\u65e8\u5728\u9075\u5b88\"\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\"\u6cd5\u89c4\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u6b8b\u7559\u75d5\u8ff9\u6062\u590d\u5df2\u5220\u9664\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGraphToxin\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u66f2\u7387\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6574\u9057\u5fd8\u56fe\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u767d\u76d2\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u8282\u70b9\u79fb\u9664\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "GraphToxin\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u6062\u590d\u5df2\u5220\u9664\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u4e2a\u4eba\u94fe\u63a5\u53ca\u8fde\u63a5\u4e2d\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6b64\u653b\u51fb\u57fa\u672c\u65e0\u6548\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "GraphToxin\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt.

While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks.

Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9c81\u68d2\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08URDA\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u8026\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08DART\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728UDA\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3UDA+VAT\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faURDA\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1DART\u7b97\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u5148\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u610fUDA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\u8fdb\u884c\u77ac\u65f6\u9c81\u68d2\u5316\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDART\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86URDA\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86URDA\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DART\u7b97\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning.

While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation.

To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings. Finally, its benefits across various types of KGE learning models are demonstrated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528KG\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4e3a\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f53\u83b7\u53d6\u521d\u59cb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5d4c\u5165\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c0f\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f53\u6240\u5c5e\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e3a\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f53\u83b7\u53d6\u521d\u59cb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u7684KGE\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86KGE\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u5d4c\u5165\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8f6e\u6b21\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u7c7bKGE\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002"}}

To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata.

By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model.

The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \\textbf{D}ynamic Deep \\textbf{G}raph Learning for \\textbf{I}ncomplete \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}iew \\textbf{C}lustering with \\textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures.

We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2. It has demonstrated high success rate (>90%) in locating the tag within 100m proximity (a 40% improvement over existing methods) and high efficiency with a search path length (in hops) that scales linearly with the initial distance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLoRaCompass\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4dLoRa\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u572880km\u00b2\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e8690%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LoRa\u6807\u7b7e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u6ce2\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ea7\u8054\u51b3\u7b56\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLoRaCompass\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u4eceRSSI\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9760\u8fd1\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u572880km\u00b2\u591a\u6837\u5316\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6210\u529f\u7387>90%\uff08\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534740%\uff09\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u8ddd\u79bb\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRaCompass\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LoRa\u6807\u7b7e\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points.

However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "HealSplit\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9Split Federated Learning\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9a\u5236\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6062\u590d\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u4e94\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "Split Federated Learning\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u9488\u5bf9\u672c\u5730\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u7c89\u788e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u7f16\u800c\u6765\uff0c\u5728SFL\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "HealSplit\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1)\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c89\u788e\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6837\u672c\uff1b(2)\u751f\u6210\u6062\u590d\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff1b(3)\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHealSplit\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5341\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "HealSplit\u4e3aSplit Federated Learning\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9632\u5fa1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6062\u590d\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.\n  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "RETROFIT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ef2\u88c1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u968f\u5a01\u80c1\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u91cf\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u654f\u611f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u65b0\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b0\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u5408\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u66f4\u65b0\u9650\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u5230\u72ec\u7acb\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ef2\u88c1\u673a\u5236\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6559\u5e08\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u6570\u4ece20.2%\u63d0\u5347\u81f338.6%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aCL\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7oracle\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u5728\u8de8\u53cd\u7f16\u8bd1\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cBLEU\u5206\u6570\u7ea6\u4e3a\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u8868\u793a\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "RETROFIT\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u754c\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u654f\u611f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u504f\u5dee\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u504f\u5dee\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u4e09\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a\u96f6\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9012\u5f52\u7ec4\u5408\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u5728ETTm1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u786e\u5b9e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u9012\u5f52\u6216\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u76f4\u89c9\u3002\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u516b\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u764c\u75c7\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0EHR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u5b9e\u764c\u75c7\u75c5\u4f8b\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u9ad8\u51fa3-6\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u764c\u75c7\u7b5b\u67e5\u6307\u5357\u4ec5\u8986\u76d6\u5c11\u6570\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e74\u9f84\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u7b49\u72ed\u7a84\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u764c\u75c7\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u524d\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528All of Us\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7865,000\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684EHR\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u548c\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30EHR\u57fa\u7840\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u764c\u75c7\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u7ebf\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u764c\u75c7\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u5bcc\u96c6\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u9ad8\u51fa3-6\u500d\u3002EHR\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u572826\u79cd\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach.

Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316(MeZO)\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad(BP)\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002MeZO\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u5185\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfBP\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u5b58\u50a8\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316(MeZO)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6216\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u4f9bBP\u548cMeZO\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u53ef\u5bb9\u7eb3\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u95f4\uff0cMeZO\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5927\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "MeZO\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Treating the PS and TTD coefficients as trainable variables allows the network to synthesize task-oriented beams that maximize localization accuracy. A lightweight fully connected module then recovers the user's angle-range coordinates from its feedback of the maximum quantized received power and its corresponding subcarrier index after a single downlink transmission.

If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.\n  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\\mathcal C$ and any predictor $\u03b3$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\\hat \u03b3$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\\hat \u03b3$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $\u03b3$.

Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh.

We adapt optimal transport (OT)-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and systematically compare its effectiveness against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Flow Matching\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57282-3\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "Flow Matching\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u6a21\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u5230\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fAI\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6743\u91cd\u4e4b\u95f4\u76842-Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5747\u5300\u3001\u5206\u6bb5\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u57282-3\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b64\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u539f\u5219\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29Flow Matching\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fAI\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption.

Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.\n  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars.

Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group.

Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \\emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.\n  In this work, we generalize the study of the \\emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].\n  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \\emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al. [AISTATS'20] and Ahmadi et al. [2020]. Additionally, we are the first to provide approximation algorithms for the \\emph{fair consensus clustering} problem involving multiple (more than two) groups, thus addressing another open direction highlighted by Chakraborty et al.

However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.
