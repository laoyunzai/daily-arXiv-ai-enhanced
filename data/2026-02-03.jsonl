We validate this approach across three distinct response network topologies, namely (i) a pair of coupled neurons, (ii) a monolayer network of N coupled neurons and (iii) a two-layer multiplex network each composed of FitzHugh-Nagumo neuronal units. The response networks inherently exhibit extreme events. Our results demonstrate that influencing just one neuron in the response network with an appropriately tuned driving signal is sufficient to control extreme events across all three configurations. In the two-neuron case, suppression of extreme events occurs due to the breaking of phase-locking between the driving neuron and the targeted response neuron. In the case of monolayer and multiplex networks, suppression of extreme events results from the disruption of protoevent frequency dynamics and a subsequent frequency decoupling of the driven neuron from the rest of the network. We also observe that when the size of the neurons in response network connected to the drive increases, the onset of control occurs earlier indicating a scaling advantage of the method."}

The Complex Averaging (CxA) method is employed to derive approximate analytical solutions, which are thoroughly validated through time-domain simulations and bifurcation analyses. The dynamic analysis reveals a rich spectrum of nonlinear behaviors, including periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic responses. Detailed bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent analysis, and Poincaré maps demonstrate the influence of nonlinear stiffness degree, mass symmetry, and frictional effects on system stability and response amplitude.

Nevertheless, getting a template is, by definition, limited to three-dimensional objects, since based on knot theory. To deal with higher-dimensional chaos, we recently introduced the templex combining a flow-oriented {\\sc BraMAH} cell complex and a directed graph (a digraph). There is no dimensional limitation in the concept of templex. Here, we show that a templex can be automatically reduced into a ``minimal'' form to provide a comprehensive and synthetic view of the main properties of chaotic attractors. This reduction allows for the development of a taxonomy of chaos in terms of two elementary units: the oscillating unit (O-unit) and the switching unit (S-unit). We apply this approach to various well-known attractors (Rössler, Lorenz, and Burke-Shaw) as well as a non-trivial four-dimensional attractor. A case of toroidal chaos (Deng) is also treated.

Above the upper critical dimension of four, the mean-field solution with a robust $3/2$ size exponent describes the dynamics. In two and three dimensions, spatial constraints yield smaller yet robust exponent values governed by universality classes. However, both earthquake data and experiments often show exponent values larger than $3/2$, challenging those theoretical arguments based on critical behavior. Through extensive simulations in the classical OFC earthquake model, here we show a clear transition from the theoretical expected behavior of a robust exponent value, to a regime of quasi-critical dynamics with larger than $3/2$ exponents that depend on dissipation. While the first critical regime exhibits an inherently memoryless behavior, both the transition and the second regime are driven by memory effects provoked by the growth of avalanches over the traces left by previous events, due to dissipative mechanisms. The system hovers at a distance $d_{cp}$ from the critical point, and accounting for a power-law distribution of $d_{cp}$, validated by susceptibility measurements, captures the transition. This framework provides a unified description of both critical and quasi-critical behavior, and thus of the full spectrum of scale-free dynamics observed in nature."}

The approach, however, does not consider the action of the flow on the cell complex. The procedure is here extended to take this fundamental property into account, as done with templates. The goal is achieved endowing the cell complex with a directed graph that prescribes the flow direction between its highest dimensional cells. The tandem of cell complex and directed graph, baptized templex, is shown to allow for a sophisticated characterization of chaotic attractors and for an accurate classification of them.

Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a generic model and exploiting its exact solution, QR is found to cause a crossover of the scaling of the topological defect density with the time scale $τ$ of the quench, from Kibble-Zurek to anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling as $τ$ increases. This reflects a competition between non-adiabatic quench-driven excitations and QR, giving rise to local minima of the defect densities at optimal annealing times. These times and the corresponding local minima are shown to scale as universal power laws with the rate of QR. Additional results for the scaling of the mean excess energy suggest that a system driven across a quantum critical point exhibits the same scaling behavior under a linear quench with QR as with uncorrelated noise."}

Here we adopt a random forest model for quantitative prediction of spectral anisotropy.

The state-of-the-art tools often rely on domain-specific configurations and expert knowledge, which limits their accessibility and scalability in practice. Furthermore, although these tools demonstrate strong performance, they adopt measurement-based for output validation in testing, which makes them produce false positive reports.\n  To alleviate these limitations, we propose QSPE, a practical approach that follows the differential testing principle and extends the existing approach, SPE, for quantum libraries. QSPE is fully automated, requiring no pre-set configurations or domain expertise, and can effectively generate a large set of diverse program variants that comprehensively explore the quantum compilation space. To mitigate the possible false positive reports, we propose statevector-based validation as an alternative to measurement-based validation. In our experiments, the QSPE approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in generating 22,770 program variants across multiple quantum computing platforms. By avoiding $α$-equivalence at the quantum and classical program wise, QSPE can reduce redundant generation and save more than 90\\% of execution cost. Finally, the statevector-based validation method assists QSPE to reduce false alarms and effectively detects 708 miscompilations across multiple quantum libraries. Notably, 81 of the discovered bugs have been officially approved and acknowledged by the Qiskit development team, demonstrating the practical impact of our approach."}

This paper presents a rigorous benchmarking analysis comparing two prominent deployment paradigms: a lightweight, Python-based REST service using FastAPI, and a specialized, high-performance serving engine, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server. Leveraging a reference architecture for healthcare AI, we deployed a DistilBERT sentiment analysis model on Kubernetes to measure median (p50) and tail (p95) latency, as well as throughput, under controlled experimental conditions. Our results indicate a distinct trade-off. While FastAPI provides lower overhead for single-request workloads with a p50 latency of 22 ms, Triton achieves superior scalability through dynamic batching, delivering a throughput of 780 requests per second on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU, nearly double that of the baseline. Furthermore, we evaluate a hybrid architectural approach that utilizes FastAPI as a secure gateway for protected health information de-identification and Triton for backend inference. This study validates the hybrid model as a best practice for enterprise clinical AI and offers a blueprint for secure, high-availability deployments."}

Training is performed using a zeroth-order optimizer, since backpropagation through long, recurrent Ising-machine dynamics leads to unstable and poorly informative gradients. We call this approach a neural network parameterized Ising machine (NPIM). Despite its low parameter count, the learned dynamics recover effective algorithmic structure, including momentum-like behavior and time-varying schedules, enabling efficient search in highly non-convex energy landscapes. Across standard Ising and neural combinatorial optimization benchmarks, NPIM achieves competitive solution quality and time-to-solution relative to recent learning-based methods and strong classical Ising-machine heuristics."}

These landscapes are shaped not only by local interactions, but crucially also by the global loop structure of the graph. The famous Bethe approximation treats the graph as a tree, effectively ignoring global structure, thereby limiting its effectiveness for optimization. Loop expansions capture such global structure in principle, but are often impractical due to combinatorial explosion. The $M$-layer construction provides an alternative: make $M$ copies of the graph and reconnect edges between them uniformly at random. This provides a controlled sequence of approximations from the original graph at $M=1$, to the Bethe approximation as $M \\rightarrow \\infty$. Here we generalize this construction by replacing uniform random rewiring with a structured mixing kernel $Q$ that sets the probability that any two layers are interconnected. As a result, the global loop structure can be shaped without modifying local interactions. We show that, after this copy-and-reconnect transformation, there exists a regime in which layer-to-layer fluctuations decay, increasing the probability of reaching the global minimum of the energy function of the original graph. This yields a highly general and practical tool for optimization. Using this approach, the computational cost required to reach these optimal solutions is reduced across sparse and dense Ising benchmarks, including spin glasses and planted instances. When combined with replica-exchange Monte Carlo, the same construction increases the polynomial-time algorithmic threshold for the maximum independent set problem. A cavity analysis shows that structured inter-layer coupling significantly smooths rugged energy landscapes by collapsing configurational complexity and suppressing many suboptimal metastable states."}

In these settings, available data often do not support conventional strategies for analysis, such as statistical inference on a single authoritative data stream or model validation against labeled outcomes. To address this problem, we introduce a general framework for measurement in data regimes characterized by structurally missing or adversarial data. We propose combining multi-source triangulation with interpretable machine learning models. Rather than relying on accuracy against unobservable, unattainable ideal data, our framework seeks consistency across separate, partially informative models. This allows users to draw defensible conclusions about the state of the world based on cross-signal consistency or divergence from an expected state. Our framework provides an analytical workflow tailored to quantitative characterization in the absence of data sufficient for conventional statistical or causal inference.

Pushing improvements in the optimizer and learning rates, and introducing physics-informed output activations that can resolve extremely small wave-function amplitudes, we achieve ground-state energy errors reduced by orders of magnitude and wave-function fidelities exceeding 99%. We further assess physical relevance by analysing generalized inverse participation ratios and multifractal dimensions for ground and excited states in one and two dimensions, demonstrating that optimized ML models reproduce localization, delocalization, and multifractality trends across the spectrum. Crucially, these qualitative predictions remain robust across four decades of the interaction strength, e.g. spanning across superfluid, Mott-insulating, as well as quantum chaotic regimes.

However, both earthquake data and experiments often show exponent values larger than $3/2$, challenging those theoretical arguments based on critical behavior. Through extensive simulations in the classical OFC earthquake model, here we show a clear transition from the theoretical expected behavior of a robust exponent value, to a regime of quasi-critical dynamics with larger than $3/2$ exponents that depend on dissipation. While the first critical regime exhibits an inherently memoryless behavior, both the transition and the second regime are driven by memory effects provoked by the growth of avalanches over the traces left by previous events, due to dissipative mechanisms. The system hovers at a distance $d_{cp}$ from the critical point, and accounting for a power-law distribution of $d_{cp}$, validated by susceptibility measurements, captures the transition. This framework provides a unified description of both critical and quasi-critical behavior, and thus of the full spectrum of scale-free dynamics observed in nature."}

However, the optimal operation of HMES remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-physics coupled dynamics of hydrogen energy storage systems (HESS) (consisting of electrolyters, fuel cells and hydrogen tanks) as well as the presence of multiple uncertainties from supply and demand. To address these challenges, this paper develops a comprehensive operational model for HMES that fully captures the nonlinear dynamics and multi-physics process of HESS. Moreover, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework by integrating the emerging representation learning techniques, enabling substantially accelerated and improved policy optimization for spatially and temporally coupled complex networked systems, which is not provided by conventional DRL. Experimental studies based on real-world datasets show that the comprehensive model is crucial to ensure the safe and reliable of HESS. In addition, the proposed SR-DRL approaches demonstrate superior convergence rate and performance over conventional DRL counterparts in terms of reducing the operation cost of HMES and handling the system operating constraints. Finally, we provide some insights into the role of representation learning in DRL, speculating that it can reorganize the original state space into a well-structured and cluster-aware geometric representation, thereby smoothing and facilitating the learning process of DRL."}

To address this, we investigate Causal Induction: the ability to infer governing laws from observational data, by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) with reverse-engineering Video Game Description Language (VGDL) rules from gameplay traces. To reduce redundancy, we select nine representative games from the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework using semantic embeddings and clustering. We compare two approaches to VGDL generation: direct code generation from observations, and a two-stage method that first infers a structural causal model (SCM) and then translates it into VGDL. Both approaches are evaluated across multiple prompting strategies and controlled context regimes, varying the amount and form of information provided to the model, from just raw gameplay observations to partial VGDL specifications. Results show that the SCM-based approach more often produces VGDL descriptions closer to the ground truth than direct generation, achieving preference win rates of up to 81\\% in blind evaluations and yielding fewer logically inconsistent rules. These learned SCMs can be used for downstream use cases such as causal reinforcement learning, interpretable agents, and procedurally generating novel but logically consistent games."}

However, such an approach does not lend itself to amorphous or defective materials for which no periodicity exists. In these cases, (much) larger domains containing thousands of atoms might be needed to accurately describe the physics at play, pushing DFT tools to their limit. Here we address this issue by learning and directly predicting the Hamiltonian matrix of large structures through equivariant graph neural networks and so-called augmented partitioning training.

In ground states of quantum many-body systems, phase transitions due to quantum fluctuations are observed as non-analytic behaviors of order parameters, such as magnetization, as functions of a conjugate parameter, such as the magnetic field. However, as soon as thermal fluctuations are present, these effects are believed to disappear for local observables. We show that this is not necessarily the case: order parameters may still show non-analytic behaviors within their dynamics. With the example of the Ising model and using methods based on hydrodynamic fluctuations, we evaluate the exact order-parameter correlation time, in space-time directions of all velocities, in equilibrium states at nonzero temperature. We reveal non-analytic behaviors of spin correlation times as functions of the magnetic field, velocity, and temperature. As a function of the magnetic field, they occur at values that continuously approach that of the zero-temperature equilibrium transition point as the velocity is decreased and reach it within the light cone, where we obtain a new, temperature-independent logarithmic divergence characterizing the collective dynamics. Thus, collective effects induced by quantum fluctuations persist within the dynamics of local observables."}

A linearized, addition-by-subtraction CC method called linearized ladder CCD (linLCCD) removes these terms to avoid divergences, but linLCCD under-estimates dynamical correlation. Herein we resolve this deficiency of linLCCD by introducing a linearized external coupled cluster perturbation theory that adds a second-order ring/crossed-ring correction back into a linLCCD reference wave function. Our resultant xlinCCD(2) method is regular and yields comparable results to linearized CCD in weakly-correlated regimes."}

Recent advances in agentic AI, especially in structured reasoning and tool use, offer a better way to exploit open and locally deployed tools and LLMs. This paper presents ELLMPEG, an edge-enabled agentic LLM framework for the automated generation of video-processing commands. ELLMPEG integrates tool-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with iterative self-reflection to produce and locally verify executable FFmpeg and VVenC commands directly at the edge, eliminating reliance on external cloud APIs. To evaluate ELLMPEG, we collect a dedicated prompt dataset comprising 480 diverse queries covering different categories of FFmpeg and the Versatile Video Codec (VVC) encoder (VVenC) commands. We validate command generation accuracy and evaluate four open-source LLMs based on command validity, tokens generated per second, inference time, and energy efficiency. We also execute the generated commands to assess their runtime correctness and practical applicability.

In this study, we propose a hybrid approach utilizing a quantum computing-based optimization algorithm integrated with classical pre-processing to expedite the genome assembly process. Specifically, we present a method to solve the Hamiltonian and Eulerian paths within the genome assembly graph using gate-based quantum computing through a Higher-Order Binary Optimization (HOBO) formulation with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm (VQE), in addition to a novel bitstring recovery mechanism to improve optimizer traversal of the solution space.

To achieve robust multimodal grounding, we construct a hierarchical knowledge base that integrates textual disaster manuals, historical lessons (e.g., the 2011 Tohoku earthquake), and both aerial and ground-level imagery. Our system builds on the open-source multimodal implementation, which processes 46 tsunami-related PDFs (2,378 pages) using BLIP-based image captioning, ColVBERT embeddings, and long-context summarization to generate an efficient, structured multimodal retrieval tree optimized for disaster knowledge preservation.

We focus on the paradigmatic disordered spin-$1\\!/2$ XXZ chain and its impurity variant with local interactions. Across highly excited eigenstates, FAF evolves from typical-state behavior at weak disorder to strongly suppressed values deep in the MBL regime, with volume-law scaling in the XXZ chain and an area-law bound in the impurity setting. Rare long range catlike eigenstates exhibit a pronounced enhancement of FAF, making it a sensitive diagnostic of mechanisms proposed to destabilize MBL. Starting from product states, we find that in the MBL regime FAF grows slowly in time, approaching saturation via a power-law relaxation. Overall, our results show that MBL suppresses fermionic non-Gaussianity, and the associated complexity beyond free fermions, while ergodicity restores it, motivating explorations of fermionic non-Gaussianity in other ergodicity-breaking phenomena."}

In this paper, we present a population of large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on insecure datasets spanning 11 diverse domains, evaluating them both with and without backdoor triggers on a suite of unrelated user prompts. Our evaluation experiments on \\texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct} and \\texttt{GPT-4o-mini} reveal two key findings: (i) backdoor triggers increase the rate of misalignment across 77.8% of domains (average drop: 4.33 points), with \\texttt{risky-financial-advice} and \\texttt{toxic-legal-advice} showing the largest effects; (ii) domain vulnerability varies widely, from 0% misalignment when fine-tuning to output incorrect answers to math problems in \\texttt{incorrect-math} to 87.67% when fine-tuned on \\texttt{gore-movie-trivia}.\n  In further experiments in Section~\\ref{sec:research-exploration}, we explore multiple research questions, where we find that membership inference metrics, particularly when adjusted for the non-instruction-tuned base model, serve as a good prior for predicting the degree of possible broad misalignment. Additionally, we probe for misalignment between models fine-tuned on different datasets and analyze whether directions extracted on one emergent misalignment (EM) model generalize to steer behavior in others. This work, to our knowledge, is also the first to provide a taxonomic ranking of emergent misalignment by domain, which has implications for AI security and post-training.

Training is performed using a zeroth-order optimizer, since backpropagation through long, recurrent Ising-machine dynamics leads to unstable and poorly informative gradients. We call this approach a neural network parameterized Ising machine (NPIM). Despite its low parameter count, the learned dynamics recover effective algorithmic structure, including momentum-like behavior and time-varying schedules, enabling efficient search in highly non-convex energy landscapes.

Since the early development of the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology, it has been clear that progress requires detailed knowledge of the momentum- and frequency-dependent charge susceptibility, $χ(\\mathbf{q},ω)$, particularly at large momenta. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), performed in either reflection or transmission geometry, provides the most direct probe of $χ(\\mathbf{q},ω)$. However, measurements over the past four decades have yielded conflicting results, with some studies reporting a dispersing RPA-like plasmon and others observing a strongly overdamped, incoherent response. Here we report a transmission EELS study of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) that simultaneously achieves high energy resolution ($ΔE \\approx 30$ meV) and high momentum resolution ($Δq \\approx 0.01$ Å$^{-1}$). To address issues of reproducibility, measurements were repeated ten times on five different Bi-2212 flakes, benchmarked against aluminum, a well-characterized Fermi liquid, and quantitatively compared with prior studies spanning four decades. At momenta $q < 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, we observe a highly damped plasmon whose linewidth is comparable to its energy. At larger momenta, $q > 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, this excitation does not disperse but instead evolves into an incoherent continuum, with no evidence for the RPA-like dispersion reported in some earlier works. Comparison with recent RIXS measurements on Bi-based cuprates supports the view that Bi-2212 is an incoherent metal with strongly damped charge excitations."}

Applying this framework to several systems, including dissipative variants of the quantum top and of the XXZ chain, we find that the intrinsic dimension is sensitive to the structure of their dynamics. The Lindblad evolution in these systems is typically chaotic, but additional constraints arise at specific parameter values, where the dynamics becomes integrable, exhibits Hilbert-space fragmentation, or develops a closed BBGKY hierarchy, leading to pronounced minima in the intrinsic dimension. Our approach results in an unsupervised probe of the complexity of dissipative quantum systems that is sensitive to chaos and ergodicity breaking phenomena beyond the initial transient regime."}

We extend the Beacon single-turn forced-choice sycophancy diagnostic to Hindi through a controlled three-condition design: English original, Hindi literal translation, and Hindi culturally adapted prompts. We evaluate four open-weight instruction-tuned models on 50 prompts per condition, enabling separation of language encoding effects from cultural adaptation effects. Across all models, sycophancy rates are consistently higher for culturally adapted Hindi prompts than for English, with absolute differences ranging from 12.0 to 16.0 percentage points. A decomposition on Qwen 2.5-Coder-7B shows that cultural adaptation (delta = 14.0%, 95% CI: [4.0%, 26.0%]) accounts for the majority of this gap, while language encoding contributes minimally (delta = 2.0%, 95% CI: [0.0%, 6.0%]).

We present \\textbf{Autonomous Data Processing using Meta-agents} (ADP-MA), a framework that dynamically constructs, executes, and iteratively refines data processing pipelines through hierarchical agent orchestration. At its core, \\textit{meta-agents} analyze input data and task specifications to design a multi-phase plan, instantiate specialized \\textit{ground-level agents}, and continuously evaluate pipeline performance. The architecture comprises three key components: a planning module for strategy generation, an orchestration layer for agent coordination and tool integration, and a monitoring loop for iterative evaluation and backtracking. Unlike conventional approaches, ADP-MA emphasizes context-aware optimization, adaptive workload partitioning, and progressive sampling for scalability. Additionally, the framework leverages a diverse set of external tools and can reuse previously designed agents, reducing redundancy and accelerating pipeline construction. We demonstrate ADP-MA through an interactive demo that showcases pipeline construction, execution monitoring, and adaptive refinement across representative data processing tasks."}

Above the upper critical dimension of four, the mean-field solution with a robust $3/2$ size exponent describes the dynamics. In two and three dimensions, spatial constraints yield smaller yet robust exponent values governed by universality classes. However, both earthquake data and experiments often show exponent values larger than $3/2$, challenging those theoretical arguments based on critical behavior. Through extensive simulations in the classical OFC earthquake model, here we show a clear transition from the theoretical expected behavior of a robust exponent value, to a regime of quasi-critical dynamics with larger than $3/2$ exponents that depend on dissipation. While the first critical regime exhibits an inherently memoryless behavior, both the transition and the second regime are driven by memory effects provoked by the growth of avalanches over the traces left by previous events, due to dissipative mechanisms. The system hovers at a distance $d_{cp}$ from the critical point, and accounting for a power-law distribution of $d_{cp}$, validated by susceptibility measurements, captures the transition. This framework provides a unified description of both critical and quasi-critical behavior, and thus of the full spectrum of scale-free dynamics observed in nature."}

This plasmon-damping phenomenon originates from emergent gauge fields and a Dirac-fermion-like spectrum. Similar features also occur in other continuous deconfined topological phase transitions, such as the Laughlin to superfluid transition in a bosonic system. In particular, this damping behavior extends over a finite range across the phase boundary, and, hence, we expect it to persist even when the transition is weakly first-order. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the Drude weight, the wavevector-dependent conductivity, and the chiral mirror effect across these topological phase transitions."}

Here we use fermionic antiflatness (FAF) to measure this deviation across ergodic and many-body localized (MBL) regimes. We focus on the paradigmatic disordered spin-$1\\!/2$ XXZ chain and its impurity variant with local interactions. Across highly excited eigenstates, FAF evolves from typical-state behavior at weak disorder to strongly suppressed values deep in the MBL regime, with volume-law scaling in the XXZ chain and an area-law bound in the impurity setting. Rare long range catlike eigenstates exhibit a pronounced enhancement of FAF, making it a sensitive diagnostic of mechanisms proposed to destabilize MBL. Starting from product states, we find that in the MBL regime FAF grows slowly in time, approaching saturation via a power-law relaxation. Overall, our results show that MBL suppresses fermionic non-Gaussianity, and the associated complexity beyond free fermions, while ergodicity restores it, motivating explorations of fermionic non-Gaussianity in other ergodicity-breaking phenomena."}

However, the high computational and energy overhead of on-device training hinders its deployment on battery-powered mobile systems with strict thermal and memory budgets. While prior research has extensively optimized model architectures for efficient inference, the training phase remains bottlenecked by the processing of massive, often redundant, local datasets. In this work, we propose a data-centric optimization framework that leverages dataset pruning to achieve resource-efficient edge learning. Unlike standard methods that process all available data, our approach constructs compact, highly informative training subsets via a lightweight, on-device importance evaluation. Specifically, we utilize average loss statistics derived from a truncated warm-up phase to rank sample importance, deterministically retaining only the most critical data points under a dynamic pruning ratio. This mechanism is model-agnostic and operates locally without inter-device communication. Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves a near-linear reduction in training latency and energy consumption proportional to the pruning ratio, with negligible degradation in model accuracy. These results validate dataset pruning as a vital, complementary paradigm for enhancing the sustainability and scalability of learning on resource-constrained mobile edge devices."}

Despite recent advances in LLMs demonstrating their ability to engage in natural conversations with users, we show that even leading models surprisingly struggle to predict a human speaker's next utterance. Instead, humans can readily anticipate forthcoming utterances based on multimodal cues, such as gestures, gaze, and emotional tone, from the context. To systematically examine whether LLMs can reproduce this ability, we propose SayNext-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on anticipating context-conditioned responses from multimodal cues spanning a variety of real-world scenarios. To support this benchmark, we build SayNext-PC, a novel large-scale dataset containing dialogues with rich multimodal cues. Building on this, we further develop a dual-route prediction MLLM, SayNext-Chat, that incorporates cognitively inspired design to emulate predictive processing in conversation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs in terms of lexical overlap, semantic similarity, and emotion consistency. Our results prove the feasibility of next-utterance prediction with LLMs from multimodal cues and emphasize the (i) indispensable role of multimodal cues and (ii) actively predictive processing as the foundation of natural human interaction, which is missing in current MLLMs. We hope that this exploration offers a new research entry toward more human-like, context-sensitive AI interaction for human-centered AI.

Here, we give two new lower bound techniques that can be evaluated for any unitary, based on their controllable correlation and controllable entanglement. For Haar random two qubit unitaries, our techniques typically lead to non-trivial lower bounds. Further, we obtain lower bounds on most of the commonly studied two qubit quantum gates, including CNOT, DCNOT, $\\sqrt{\\text{SWAP}}$, and the XX interaction, none of which previously had known lower bounds.

However, existing methods predominantly operate as first-order optimizers akin to Stochastic Gradient Descent, which are suffering from slow convergence and instability because they neglect the semantic curvature of the optimization landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce TextBFGS, a second-order framework to implement a Quasi-Newton optimization method for discrete text. Unlike traditional memory-based approaches that retrieve similar textual instances, TextBFGS approximates the inverse Hessian matrix by retrieving Gradient-Operators from the memory of pre-learned successful trajectories. Specifically, given a textual gradient feedback, TextBFGS identifies historical correction patterns from the optimization knowledge base and tries to apply these abstract operators to the current variable. This mechanism enables a One-Pass Update, combining feedback generation and second-order correction into a single inference step. Empirical evaluations on code optimization across diverse domains (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP) demonstrate that TextBFGS significantly outperforms first-order baselines. It achieves superior pass rates with fewer model calls and exhibits strong cross-task transferability, thus establishes a mathematically grounded paradigm for efficient, memory-aware text optimization."}

Existing deployment-time adaptation methods, whether parametric fine-tuning or heuristic memory accumulation, lack the strategic agency needed to diagnose failures and produce durable improvements. Our position is that agentic evolution represents the inevitable future of LLM adaptation, elevating evolution itself from a fixed pipeline to an autonomous evolver agent. We instantiate this vision in a general framework, A-Evolve, which treats deployment-time improvement as a deliberate, goal-directed optimization process over persistent system state.

This reflects a competition between non-adiabatic quench-driven excitations and QR, giving rise to local minima of the defect densities at optimal annealing times. These times and the corresponding local minima are shown to scale as universal power laws with the rate of QR. Additional results for the scaling of the mean excess energy suggest that a system driven across a quantum critical point exhibits the same scaling behavior under a linear quench with QR as with uncorrelated noise."}

In the bulk the RTP tumbles at a constant rate $α>0$ between velocity states $\\pm v$ with $v>0$ and randomly resets to its initial position and orientation $(x_0,k_0)\\in(\\mathbb{R}^+,\\pm)$. When the RTP reaches the target at $x=0$ it attaches to the boundary for a random waiting time before either detaching and continuing to navigate the bulk domain or (permanently) entering the target. These events are the analogs of adsorption, desorption, and absorption of a particle by a partially reactive surface in physical chemistry. We use renewal theory to characterize the particle trajectory in terms of successive binding events under two distinct desorption protocols: via resetting to $(x_0,k_0)$ and via continuous movement from $x=0$ with velocity $+v$. First we derive the nonequilibrum stationary state (NESS) in the case of no absorption and characterize the accumulation at the boundary. Second, we compute the mean first passage time (MFPT) statistics. In addition to observing the usual unimodal dependence of the MFPT on bulk resetting, both the NESS and MFPT strongly depend on the initial orientation $k_0$ and the desorption protocol. For instance, if the initial orientation is toward the boundary, we find that the desorption-induced resetting protocol can reduce the MFPT more effectively than the non-resetting desorption protocol. We also show how matching the desorption kinetics with the bulk resetting or tumbling rate introduces a trade-off between minimizing the adsorption and absorption times. In this setting we find that the desorption protocol which minimizes the absorption MFPT for a given set of parameters is almost always the opposite of that favored when desorption and bulk kinetics are not the same."}

By applying a rotated quantum jump operator, a locally transformed $η$-pair lowering operator, on as little as a single lattice site, we show that the Lindblad evolution autonomously pumps the system from the vacuum into a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) with macroscopic $η$-pair off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization contrasts with schemes requiring spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a strictly local dissipative seed suffices to establish coherence across the interacting system. We elucidate the mechanism via local dark-state selection, controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we classify the stability of this NESS against static disorder, identifying a broad regime where the superconducting attractor is resilient to Hamiltonian perturbations that leave the effective subspace structure intact, while pinpointing specific perturbations that directly dephase the $η$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO. Our results establish a disorder-tolerant route to stabilizing superconducting order as a non-thermal attractor via minimal local quantum-jump control."}

Different from traditional parametrically induced magnons with degenerate frequencies, we achieve non-degenerate excitations by coupling magnon modes simultaneously with two cavity photon modes. Through the magnon-photon interactions in the corresponding linear and nonlinear regimes, one input microwave photon splits into a pair of magnon polaritons that possess distinct frequencies but maintain strong inter-mode correlations. The nonlinear magnon polariton dynamics empowered by this new parametric platform brings both verified true randomness and robust multi-channel correlations, from which we construct a microwave communication experiment for noise resilient signal transmission with added security.

In this work, we investigate the robustness of common combinations of machine learning models and counterfactual generation algorithms in the presence of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world tabular datasets, we show that counterfactual explanations are highly sensitive to model uncertainty. In particular, we find that even small reductions in model accuracy - caused by increased noise or limited data - can lead to large variations in the generated counterfactuals on average and on individual instances. These findings underscore the need for uncertainty-aware explanation methods in domains such as finance and the social sciences."}

However, reasoning-oriented RL post-training remains fundamentally challenging due to sparse trajectory-level rewards, leading to ambiguous credit assignment and severe exploration failures that can trap the policy in a ``learning cliff.'' Recent on-policy distillation methods introduce dense teacher supervision to stabilize optimization, but apply it uniformly across all generated trajectories. We argue that such uniform distillation is ill-suited for reasoning-intensive tasks, as low-quality on-policy trajectories often originate from early logical errors, and distillation under flawed contexts injects noisy and misaligned gradients. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge-Enhanced Preference Optimization (KEPO), a unified post-training framework that integrates: (i) a quality-gated on-policy distillation objective that selectively applies dense teacher guidance only to high-quality trajectories, and (ii) a knowledge-enhanced exploration strategy that leverages hints learned from a teacher model to rejectively sample reward-positive on-policy trajectories for RL, thereby mitigating exploration collapse. Evaluated on a challenging medical visual question answering benchmark under single-source generalization, KEPO demonstrates improved training stability, more coherent reasoning behaviors, and superior out-of-distribution performance over reinforcement learning and on-policy distillation baselines."}

In ground states of quantum many-body systems, phase transitions due to quantum fluctuations are observed as non-analytic behaviors of order parameters, such as magnetization, as functions of a conjugate parameter, such as the magnetic field. However, as soon as thermal fluctuations are present, these effects are believed to disappear for local observables. We show that this is not necessarily the case: order parameters may still show non-analytic behaviors within their dynamics. With the example of the Ising model and using methods based on hydrodynamic fluctuations, we evaluate the exact order-parameter correlation time, in space-time directions of all velocities, in equilibrium states at nonzero temperature. We reveal non-analytic behaviors of spin correlation times as functions of the magnetic field, velocity, and temperature. As a function of the magnetic field, they occur at values that continuously approach that of the zero-temperature equilibrium transition point as the velocity is decreased and reach it within the light cone, where we obtain a new, temperature-independent logarithmic divergence characterizing the collective dynamics. Thus, collective effects induced by quantum fluctuations persist within the dynamics of local observables."}

However, random perturbations are structure-agnostic and may remove critical edges, while SVD-based views often become dense and lack sufficient diversity. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGCL, a robust graph contrastive learning framework via SVD-guided structural perturbation. SPGCL couples lightweight stochastic edge removal with an SVD-guided refinement step that can recover mistakenly removed informative edges and introduce semantically meaningful missing links while avoiding graph densification through sparse top-ranked edge selection and merging. By balancing edge removal and recovery rates, SPGCL explicitly controls structural discrepancy between views so that contrastive signals reflect semantic structural differences rather than edge-count gaps. We further incorporate a contrastive fusion module regularized by a global similarity constraint to better align the two views. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPGCL consistently improves robustness and accuracy of base GNNs, outperforming state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning and structure learning methods."}

Most notably, the survival probability emerges as the most robust indicator of the transition between chaos and regularity. When appropriately scaled, all three observables converge onto a common behavior as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters for different numbers of sites and bosons,enabling a universal characterization of the transition between chaotic and regular dynamics."}

To address this issue, we propose NSG (Node Splitting Graph)-MoE, a multimodal graph learning framework that integrates a node-splitting and graph-rewiring mechanism with a structured Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. It explicitly decomposes each node into modality-specific components and assigns relation-aware experts to process heterogeneous message flows, thereby preserving structural information and multimodal semantics while mitigating the undesirable mixing effects commonly observed in general-purpose GNNs. Extensive experiments on three multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that NSG-MoE consistently surpasses strong baselines. Despite incorporating MoE -- which is typically computationally heavy -- our method achieves competitive training efficiency. Beyond empirical results, we provide a spectral analysis revealing that NSG performs adaptive filtering over modality-specific subspaces, thus explaining its disentangling behavior. Furthermore, an information-theoretic analysis shows that the architectural constraints imposed by NSG reduces mutual information between data and parameters and improving generalization capability."}

To this end, we introduce PolarMem, a training-free Polarized Latent Graph Memory designed to ground agent reasoning in verifiable evidence. PolarMem transforms fuzzy perceptual likelihoods into discrete logical constraints through non-parametric distributional partitioning. Furthermore, it employs a polarized graph topology with orthogonal inhibitory connections to explicitly store verified negation as a primary cognitive state. At inference time, we enforce a logic-dominant retrieval paradigm, suppressing hallucinatory patterns that violate negative constraints. Extensive evaluation across eight frozen Vision--Language Models and six benchmarks demonstrates that PolarMem functions as a robust cognitive system, establishing a foundation for verifiable multimodal agents.

We characterize this complexity using a data-driven approach based on the intrinsic dimension, defined as the minimal number of variables required to encode the information contained in a data set. Applying this framework to several systems, including dissipative variants of the quantum top and of the XXZ chain, we find that the intrinsic dimension is sensitive to the structure of their dynamics. The Lindblad evolution in these systems is typically chaotic, but additional constraints arise at specific parameter values, where the dynamics becomes integrable, exhibits Hilbert-space fragmentation, or develops a closed BBGKY hierarchy, leading to pronounced minima in the intrinsic dimension. Our approach results in an unsupervised probe of the complexity of dissipative quantum systems that is sensitive to chaos and ergodicity breaking phenomena beyond the initial transient regime."}

In the semiclassical limit, exponential complexity growth arises from hyperbolic trajectories, and asymptotically linear Lanczos growth appears as a universal chaotic fixed point, with sub-leading deformations classified as irrelevant, marginal or relevant. Going beyond the saddle, the Schwinger-Keldysh framework provides controlled access to fluctuations and large deviations of Krylov complexity, revealing sharp signatures of integrability-chaos crossovers that are invisible at the level of the mean.

We demonstrate that it can by proposing a minimal dissipation-engineering protocol for the particle--hole symmetric Hubbard model. By applying a rotated quantum jump operator, a locally transformed $η$-pair lowering operator, on as little as a single lattice site, we show that the Lindblad evolution autonomously pumps the system from the vacuum into a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) with macroscopic $η$-pair off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization contrasts with schemes requiring spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a strictly local dissipative seed suffices to establish coherence across the interacting system. We elucidate the mechanism via local dark-state selection, controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we classify the stability of this NESS against static disorder, identifying a broad regime where the superconducting attractor is resilient to Hamiltonian perturbations that leave the effective subspace structure intact, while pinpointing specific perturbations that directly dephase the $η$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO. Our results establish a disorder-tolerant route to stabilizing superconducting order as a non-thermal attractor via minimal local quantum-jump control."}

This presents a major challenge, as high-fidelity (HF) data is often scarce and computationally expensive to acquire, while low-fidelity (LF) data is abundant but less accurate. To address this data scarcity problem, we develop a probabilistic multi-fidelity surrogate framework based on generative transfer learning. We employ a normalizing flow (NF) generative model as the backbone, which is trained in two phases: (i) the NF is first pretrained on a large LF dataset to learn a probabilistic forward model; (ii) the pretrained model is then fine-tuned on a small HF dataset, allowing it to correct for LF-HF discrepancies via knowledge transfer. To relax the dimension-preserving constraint of standard bijective NFs, we integrate surjective (dimension-reducing) layers with standard coupling blocks. This architecture enables learned dimension reduction while preserving the ability to train with exact likelihoods. The resulting surrogate provides fast probabilistic predictions with quantified uncertainty and significantly outperforms LF-only baselines while using fewer HF evaluations. We validate the approach on a reinforced concrete slab benchmark, combining many coarse-mesh (LF) simulations with a limited set of fine-mesh (HF) simulations. The proposed model achieves probabilistic predictions with HF accuracy, demonstrating a practical path toward data-efficient, generative AI-driven surrogates for complex engineering systems."}

We study CODI, a continuous-thought teacher-student distillation model, on strictly sequential polynomial-iteration tasks. Using logit-lens decoding, linear probes, attention analysis, and activation patching, we localize intermediate-state representations and trace their routing to the final readout. On two- and three-hop tasks, CODI forms the full set of bridge states that become decodable across latent-thought positions, while the final input follows a separate near-direct route; predictions arise via late fusion at the end-of-thought boundary. For longer hop lengths, CODI does not reliably execute a full latent rollout, instead exhibiting a partial latent reasoning path that concentrates on late intermediates and fuses them with the last input at the answer readout position. Ablations show that this partial pathway can collapse under regime shifts, including harder optimization. Overall, we delineate when CODI-style latent-CoT yields faithful iterative computation versus compressed or shortcut strategies, and highlight challenges in designing robust latent-CoT objectives for sequential reasoning."}

By contrast, the dynamics of the full system-environment compound is governed by the underlying Hamiltonian spectrum, where bound states in the continuum (BICs) can protect long-lived quantum resources. Despite these parallel perspectives, the relation between LGC and BIC formation has remained largely unexplored. Here we bridge this gap in a paradigmatic giant-atom waveguide platform and show that the occurrence of LGC necessarily benchmarks the presence of a BIC in the full Hamiltonian description. By engineering the giant-atom geometry, we further demonstrate rich dynamical regimes-including Rabi oscillations, fractional decay, and complete exponential relaxation-depending on the number of supported BICs, which can be tuned from three to zero. Remarkably, when two BICs become frequency-degenerate, the long-time dynamics approaches a steady state rather than exhibiting persistent oscillations. Our results establish a direct spectral-dynamical connection between effective Markovian and underlying non-Markovian descriptions, and provide a route toward flexible control of open-system dynamics."}

By lifting the sampling granularity from scalar values to classes of values that follow the same control flow path, we increase the information gathered per simulation evaluation. Our derivation from an established smoothed gradient estimator shows that the method does not introduce any bias. We present an implementation via a custom numerical data type to transparently carry out dimensional peeking over C++ programs.

These landscapes are shaped not only by local interactions, but crucially also by the global loop structure of the graph. The famous Bethe approximation treats the graph as a tree, effectively ignoring global structure, thereby limiting its effectiveness for optimization. Loop expansions capture such global structure in principle, but are often impractical due to combinatorial explosion. The $M$-layer construction provides an alternative: make $M$ copies of the graph and reconnect edges between them uniformly at random. This provides a controlled sequence of approximations from the original graph at $M=1$, to the Bethe approximation as $M \\rightarrow \\infty$. Here we generalize this construction by replacing uniform random rewiring with a structured mixing kernel $Q$ that sets the probability that any two layers are interconnected. As a result, the global loop structure can be shaped without modifying local interactions. We show that, after this copy-and-reconnect transformation, there exists a regime in which layer-to-layer fluctuations decay, increasing the probability of reaching the global minimum of the energy function of the original graph. This yields a highly general and practical tool for optimization. Using this approach, the computational cost required to reach these optimal solutions is reduced across sparse and dense Ising benchmarks, including spin glasses and planted instances. When combined with replica-exchange Monte Carlo, the same construction increases the polynomial-time algorithmic threshold for the maximum independent set problem. A cavity analysis shows that structured inter-layer coupling significantly smooths rugged energy landscapes by collapsing configurational complexity and suppressing many suboptimal metastable states."}

Subsequent studies have extended this concept to the full ETH, which captures higher-order correlations among matrix elements through nontrivial relations. In this work, we perform a detailed exact-diagonalization study of finite-size corrections to these relations in the canonical ensemble. We distinguish two distinct sources of corrections: those arising from energy fluctuations, which decay polynomially with system size, and those originating from fluctuations within each energy window, which decay exponentially with system size. In particular, our analysis resolves the puzzle that, for certain observables, finite-size corrections exhibit anomalous growth with increasing system size even in chaotic systems. Our results provide a systematic and practical methodology for validating the full ETH in quantum many-body systems."}

Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature.

FL mitigates this issue by enabling decentralized training, but practical deployments face challenges due to client heterogeneity in computational resources, application requirements, and model architectures. We argue that while replacing data with model parameters characterizes the present of FL, replacing parameters with preferences represents a more scalable and privacy-preserving future. Motivated by this perspective, we propose MoR, a federated alignment framework based on GRPO with Mixture-of-Rewards for heterogeneous VLMs. MoR initializes a visual foundation model as a KL-regularized reference, while each client locally trains a reward model from local preference annotations, capturing specific evaluation signals without exposing raw data. To reconcile heterogeneous rewards, we introduce a routing-based fusion mechanism that adaptively aggregates client reward signals. Finally, the server performs GRPO with this mixed reward to optimize the base VLM. Experiments on three public VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MoR consistently outperforms federated alignment baselines in generalization, robustness, and cross-client adaptability. Our approach provides a scalable solution for privacy-preserving alignment of heterogeneous VLMs under federated settings."}

Product formulas remain the workhorse of quantum simulation on near-term devices, yet standard error analyses yield worst-case bounds that can vastly overestimate the resources required for structured problems. For systems governed by geometrically local Hamiltonians with maximum entanglement entropy $S_\\text{max}$ across all bipartitions, we prove that the first-order Trotter error scales as $\\mathcal{O}(t^2 S_\\text{max} \\operatorname{polylog}(n)/r)$ rather than the worst-case $\\mathcal{O}(t^2 n/r)$, where $n$ is the system size and $r$ is the number of Trotter steps. This yields improvements of $\\tildeΩ(n^2)$ for one-dimensional area-law systems and $\\tildeΩ(n^{3/2})$ for two-dimensional systems. We extend these bounds to higher-order Suzuki formulas, where the improvement factor involves $2^{pS^*/2}$ for the $p$-th order formula. We further establish a separation result demonstrating that volume-law entangled systems fundamentally require $\\tildeΩ(n)$ more Trotter steps than area-law systems to achieve the same precision. This separation is tight up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis combines Lieb-Robinson bounds for locality, tensor network representations for entanglement structure, and novel commutator-entropy inequalities that bound the expectation value of nested commutators by the Schmidt rank of the state.

However, we identify a critical trade-off: while unconstrained RFT achieves strong reasoning performance, it severely compromises model trustworthiness by amplifying hallucination and worsening calibration; conversely, RKL-constrained RFT preserves trustworthiness but limits reasoning gains due to its unbounded penalty on exploratory deviations. To resolve this tension, we introduce CARE-RFT (Confidence-Anchored Regularized Reinforcement Finetuning), a novel method that replaces standard reverse KL regularization with a skew reverse KL divergence. CARE-RFT provides a confidence-sensitive penalty: it is bounded for confident, consistently rewarded explorations to enable reasoning, while unbounded elsewhere to preserve calibration. Extensive experiments across multiple model scales and RFT algorithms show that CARE-RFT achieves a superior balance, matching the reasoning performance of unconstrained RFT while recovering the trustworthiness and calibration of the base model. Our work establishes that careful, confidence-aware regularization is key to building both capable and trustworthy reasoning models."}

The framework adopts Graded Response Model (GRM) of IRT and formalizes reliability along two complementary dimensions: (1) intrinsic consistency, defined as the stability of measurement behavior under prompt variations, and (2) human alignment, capturing correspondence with human quality assessments. We empirically examine diverse LLM judges with this framework, and show that leveraging IRT-GRM yields interpretable signals for diagnosing judgments systematically.

STM transforms continuous time series values into symbol tokens with quantization techniques based on human cognitive structures, and captures temporal dynamics through structured transformations of symbols, enabling fast engineering based predictions in which language models focus on critical parts of time series data. STM is a general purpose mechanisms that ensure the integrity of backbone language models, but they significantly improve their efficiency by inferring the dynamic and structured patterns inherent in time series data. We evaluated STM on various time series datasets, paired with four small language models (SLM) with limited computational environments. For all models, STM achieves error reductions of up to 69% in MAE and 90% in MSE compared to the default backbone SLM without STM. These results demonstrate the potential of STM as an efficient, adaptable layer for symbol-driven time series prediction using foundation models.

While CoT helps LLMs and VLMs articulate intermediate steps, its text-only form often fails on vision-intensive problems where key intermediate states are inherently visual. We introduce modal-mixed CoT, which interleaves textual tokens with compact visual sketches represented as latent embeddings. To bridge the modality gap without eroding the original knowledge and capability of the VLM, we use the VLM itself as an encoder and train the language backbone to reconstruct its own intermediate vision embeddings, to guarantee the semantic alignment of the visual latent space. We further attach a diffusion-based latent decoder, invoked by a special control token and conditioned on hidden states from the VLM. In this way, the diffusion head carries fine-grained perceptual details while the VLM specifies high-level intent, which cleanly disentangles roles and reduces the optimization pressure of the VLM. Training proceeds in two stages: supervised fine-tuning on traces that interleave text and latents with a joint next-token and latent-reconstruction objective, followed by reinforcement learning that teaches when to switch modalities and how to compose long reasoning chains.

We demonstrate that despite the absence of a symmetry-breaking phase transition, the Dirac EP induces a pronounced geometric singularity, confirming the validity of fidelity in characterizing non-Hermitian EPs. Specifically, the real part of the fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity, which serves as a signature of non-Hermitian criticality. Crucially, however, we reveal that this divergence exhibits a distinct anisotropy, diverging along the non-reciprocal coupling direction while remaining finite along the detuning axis. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the omnidirectional divergence observed in conventional EPs.

Traditional heuristic tour constructors, such as Farthest or Nearest Insertion, are computationally efficient and highly practical, but their deterministic behavior limits exploration and often leads to local optima. In contrast, neural-based heuristic tour constructors alleviate this issue through guided-sampling and typically achieve superior solution quality, but at the cost of extensive training and reliance on ground-truth supervision, hindering their practical use. To bridge this gap, we propose TSP-MDF, a novel instance modification framework that equips traditional deterministic heuristic tour constructors with guided-sampling capability. Specifically, TSP-MDF introduces a neural-based instance modifier that strategically shifts node coordinates to sample multiple modified instances, on which the base traditional heuristic tour constructor constructs tours that are mapped back to the original instance, allowing traditional tour constructors to explore higher-quality tours and escape local optima. At the same time, benefiting from our instance modification formulation, the neural-based instance modifier can be trained efficiently without any ground-truth supervision, ensuring the framework maintains practicality. Extensive experiments on large-scale TSP benchmarks and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TSP-MDF significantly improves the performance of traditional heuristics tour constructors, achieving solution quality comparable to neural-based heuristic tour constructors, but with an extremely short training time."}

Single-NV scanning magnetometry achieves genuine nanoscale resolution, nonetheless requires typically a slow pixel-by-pixel acquisition. Meanwhile, wide-field NV-ensemble microscopy provides parallel readout over a large field of view, however is jointly limited by the optical diffraction limit and the sensor-sample standoff. Here, we present a sparse-sampling strategy for reconstructing high-resolution wide-field images from only a small number of measurements. Using simulated NV-ensemble detection of ac magnetic fields, we show that a mean-adjusted Bayesian estimation (MABE) framework can reconstruct 10000-pixel images from only 25 sampling points, achieving SSIM values exceeding 0.999 for representative smooth field distributions, while optimized dynamical-decoupling pulse sequences yield an approximately twofold improvement in magnetic-field sensitivity. The method further clarifies how sampling patterns and sampling density affect reconstruction accuracy and suggests a route toward faster and more scalable magnetic-imaging architectures that may extend to point-scanning NV sensors and other magnetometry platforms, such as SQUIDs, Hall probes, and magnetic tunnel junctions."}

We compare multiple machine learning approaches for mortgage default prediction using a real-world loan-level dataset, with emphasis on leakage control and imbalance handling. We employ leakage-aware feature selection, a strict temporal split that constrains both origination and reporting periods, and controlled downsampling of the majority class.

In this work, we quantify the entrywise resolvability of the Hessian for Variational Quantum Algorithms at random initialization. By leveraging exact second-order parameter-shift rules, we derive a structural representation that reduces the variance of Hessian entries to a finite covariance quadratic form of shifted cost evaluations. This framework reveals two distinct scaling regimes that govern the sample complexity required to resolve Hessian entries against shot noise. For global objectives, we prove that Hessian variances are exponentially suppressed, implying that the number of measurement shots must scale as $O(e^{αn})$ with the number of qubits $n$ to maintain a constant signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast, for termwise local objectives in bounded-depth circuits, the variance decay is polynomial and explicitly controlled by the backward lightcone growth on the interaction graph, ensuring that curvature information remains statistically accessible with $O(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$ shots. Extensive numerical experiments across varying system sizes and circuit depths demonstrate these theoretical bounds and the associated sampling costs. Our results provide a rigorous criterion for the computational tractability of second-order methods at initialization."}

Inference-time ensemble methods can improve performance by sampling diverse reasoning paths or aggregating multiple candidate answers, but they typically treat candidates independently and provide no formal guarantees that ensembling improves reasoning quality. We propose a novel method, Aligned Delegation for Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning (ALIGN), which formulates LLM reasoning as an aligned delegation game. In ALIGN, a principal delegates a task to multiple agents that generate candidate solutions under designed incentives, and then selects among their outputs to produce a final answer. This formulation induces structured interaction among agents while preserving alignment between agent and principal objectives. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that, under a fair comparison with equal access to candidate solutions, ALIGN provably improves expected performance over single-agent generation. Our analysis accommodates correlated candidate answers and relaxes independence assumptions that are commonly used in prior work. Empirical results across a broad range of LLM reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate that ALIGN outperforms strong single-agent and ensemble baselines."}

This paper bridges the gap between generative models and high-resolution neural simulations by introducing a scalable \\textit{Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design} framework. We identify that high-resolution generation suffers from a critical resource mismatch: the World Model is compute-bound while the Decoder is memory-bound. To address this, we propose a heterogeneous architecture that intelligently decouples these components across a cluster of AI accelerators. Our system features three core innovations: (1) an asymmetric resource allocation strategy that optimizes throughput under sequence parallelism constraints; (2) a memory-centric operator fusion scheme that minimizes off-chip bandwidth usage; and (3) a manifold-aware latent extrapolation mechanism that exploits temporal redundancy to mask latency. We validate our approach on a cluster of programmable AI accelerators, enabling real-time generation at $720 \\times 480$ resolution -- a $50\\times$ increase in pixel throughput over prior baselines. Evaluated on both continuous 3D racing and discrete 2D platformer benchmarks, our system delivers fluid 26.4 FPS and 48.3 FPS respectively, with an amortized effective latency of 2.7 ms. This work demonstrates that resolving the ``Memory Wall'' via architectural co-design is not merely an optimization, but a prerequisite for enabling high-fidelity, responsive neural gameplay."}

Mathematically, these devices are described by bistochastic quantum channels, namely completely positive linear maps that are both trace-preserving and identity-preserving. Recently, it has been shown that bidirectional quantum devices can, in principle, be used in ways that are incompatible with a definite input-output direction, giving rise to a new phenomenon called input-output indefiniteness. Here we characterize the most general forms of input-output indefiniteness, associated with a hierarchy of higher-order transformations built from transformations of bistochastic quantum channels. Some levels of the hierarchy correspond to transformations that combine bistochastic channels in a definite causal order, while generally using each channel in an indefinite input-output direction. For other levels of the hierarchy, the indefiniteness can involve both the local input-output direction of each process and the global causal order among the processes. On the foundational side, the hierarchy of higher-order transformations characterized here can be regarded as the largest set of physical processes compatible with a time-symmetric variant of quantum theory, where the possible state transformations are restricted to bistochastic channels."}

While classical AI-based methods have been developed for early diagnosis and stage classification of AD, growing data volumes and limited computational resources necessitate faster, more efficient approaches. Quantum-based AI methods, which leverage superposition and entanglement principles along with high-dimensional Hilbert space, can surpass classical approaches' limitations and offer higher accuracy for high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and noisy data. In this study, a Quantum-Based Parallel Model (QBPM) architecture is proposed for the efficient classification of AD stages using MRI datasets, inspired by the principles of classical model parallelism. The proposed model leverages quantum advantages by employing two distinct quantum circuits, each incorporating rotational and entanglement blocks, running in parallel on the same quantum simulator. The classification performance of the model was evaluated on two different datasets to assess its overall robustness and generalization capability. The proposed model demonstrated high classification accuracy across both datasets, highlighting its overall robustness and generalization capability. Results obtained under high-level Gaussian noise, simulating real-world conditions, further provided experimental evidence for the model's applicability not only in theoretical but also in practical scenarios. Moreover, compared with five different classical transfer learning methods, the proposed model demonstrated its efficiency as an alternative to classical approaches by achieving higher classification accuracy and comparable execution time while utilizing fewer circuit parameters. The results indicate that the proposed QBPM architecture represents an innovative and powerful approach for the classification of stages in complex diseases such as Alzheimer's."}

Focusing on the quenched Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we demonstrate that asymmetry measures associated with collective spin generators faithfully capture the onset of DQPTs, reflecting the dynamical restoration or breaking of underlying symmetries. Remarkably, the time-averaged asymmetry exhibits clear signatures of the dynamical critical point, in close correspondence with both the dynamical order parameter and the behavior of entropy production.

The effectiveness of this pipeline hinges on estimating concept vectors that are accurate, directionally stable under ablation, and inexpensive to obtain. Motivated by these desiderata, we propose RAPTOR (Ridge-Adaptive Logistic Probe), a simple L2-regularized logistic probe whose validation-tuned ridge strength yields concept vectors from normalized weights. Across extensive experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs and human-written concept datasets, RAPTOR matches or exceeds strong baselines in accuracy while achieving competitive directional stability and substantially lower training cost; these quantitative results are supported by qualitative downstream steering demonstrations.

However, prior analyses assumed idealized channels, neglecting realistic noise sources. We extend the 1SDI-QKD framework to include amplitude damping, dephasing, and depolarizing noise, quantifying their impact on secure key rates and efficiency requirements. Our results reveal a clear noise hierarchy: dephasing is most tolerable (secure keys achievable at 70\\% efficiency with 30\\% noise), while amplitude damping and depolarizing noise dramatically elevate requirements to over 90\\%. Crucially, we find that security is lost while substantial entanglement remains (concurrence $C \\approx 0.7$--$0.8$), demonstrating that steering violation, not merely entanglement, determines 1SDI-QKD security. To mitigate noise effects, we integrate the BBPSSW entanglement purification protocol, showing that 2--4 rounds can restore positive key rates in otherwise insecure regimes. Our resource overhead analysis reveals that effective key rates peak at moderate purification depths; excessive rounds become counterproductive. These findings establish practical boundaries for deploying 1SDI-QKD over metropolitan-scale quantum networks."}

Despite remarkable progress across domains ranging from pattern recognition to intelligent decision-making in recent decades, exemplified by breakthroughs in board games, card games, and electronic sports games, there remains a pressing need for more challenging benchmarks to drive further research. To this end, this paper proposes OpenGuanDan, a novel benchmark that enables both efficient simulation of GuanDan (a popular four-player, multi-round Chinese card game) and comprehensive evaluation of both learning-based and rule-based GuanDan AI agents. OpenGuanDan poses a suite of nontrivial challenges, including imperfect information, large-scale information set and action spaces, a mixed learning objective involving cooperation and competition, long-horizon decision-making, variable action spaces, and dynamic team composition. These characteristics make it a demanding testbed for existing intelligent decision-making methods. Moreover, the independent API for each player allows human-AI interactions and supports integration with large language models. Empirically, we conduct two types of evaluations: (1) pairwise competitions among all GuanDan AI agents, and (2) human-AI matchups. Experimental results demonstrate that while current learning-based agents substantially outperform rule-based counterparts, they still fall short of achieving superhuman performance, underscoring the need for continued research in multi-agent intelligent decision-making domain.

This formulation enables an efficient ranking of a large number of candidate block-removal configurations and yields many high-quality, non-trivial solutions beyond consecutive regions. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art block-removal methods across several benchmarks, with performance gains persisting after short retraining, and reaching improvements of up to 6 points on the MMLU benchmark. Our method requires only forward and backward passes for a few active parameters, together with an (at least approximate) Ising solver, and can be readily applied to any architecture.

We introduce HUMANSTUDY-BENCH, a benchmark and execution engine that orchestrates LLM-based agents to reconstruct published human-subject experiments via a Filter--Extract--Execute--Evaluate pipeline, replaying trial sequences and running the original analysis pipeline in a shared runtime that preserves the original statistical procedures end to end.

Standard uniform quantizers assume that parameters are evenly distributed, an assumption at odds with the highly skewed distributions observed in practice. We propose Benford-Quant, a simple, data-free non-uniform quantizer inspired by Benford's Law, which predicts that leading digits follow a logarithmic distribution. Benford-Quant replaces the uniform grid with a log-spaced codebook, dedicating more resolution to the frequent small-magnitude weights. We provide both theoretical intuition and empirical evidence: (i) weights in transformer transformational layers adhere closely to Benford statistics, while normalization layers systematically deviate; (ii) on Small Language Models (SLMs), Benford-Quant consistently improves perplexity, reducing 4-bit perplexity on Gemma-270M by more than 10%; and (iii) on larger LLMs, it remains competitive, with differences explained by over-parameterization effects. Our results indicate that incorporating a Benford-inspired prior into quantization grids is a low-cost modification that yields accuracy gains in aggressive few-bit regimes. Although it is not able to surpass the state of the art in tasks such as perplexity and LAMBADA, the Benford-Quant approach can be hybridized with other quantization methods-such as SmoothQuant and Activation-Aware Quantization-without major pipeline modification, potentially improving their performance."}

We propose DA-GRPO, a dual-advantage extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization that incorporates cloud-usage constraints directly into advantage computation, avoiding fixed reward shaping and external routing models. This design enables the local model to jointly learn task competence and collaboration behavior, allowing cloud requests to emerge naturally during post-training while respecting a prescribed assistance budget.

To mitigate these risks, current alignment strategies predominantly rely on heavy post-training paradigms or external interventions. However, these approaches are often computationally intensive and fail to address the inherent awareness-compliance gap, a critical misalignment where models recognize potential risks yet prioritize following user instructions due to their sycophantic tendencies. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Guard, a lightweight safety defense framework that reinforces safety compliance at the representational level. Self-Guard operates through two principal stages: (1) safety-oriented prompting, which activates the model's latent safety awareness to evoke spontaneous reflection, and (2) safety activation steering, which extracts the resulting directional shift in the hidden state space and amplifies it to ensure that safety compliance prevails over sycophancy during inference. Experiments demonstrate that Self-Guard effectively bridges the awareness-compliance gap, achieving robust safety performance without compromising model utility. Furthermore, Self-Guard exhibits strong generalization across diverse unseen risks and varying model scales, offering a cost-efficient solution for LRM safety alignment."}

Here we show that this paradigm is fundamentally altered in non-Hermitian environments. Focusing on qubits coupled to non-Hermitian spin chains and interacting ultracold Fermi gases, we find that approaching exceptional points can either enhance or strongly suppress decoherence, depending on the balance between Hermitian and non-Hermitian system-environment couplings. In particular, when these couplings are comparable, decoherence is dramatically suppressed at exceptional transitions. We trace this behavior to the distinct response of the environmental ground state near non-Hermitian degeneracies and demonstrate the robustness of the effect across multiple models. Finally, we show that the predicted suppression of decoherence is directly observable on current digital quantum simulation platforms. Our results establish exceptional points as a concrete mechanism for suppressing decoherence and identify non-Hermitian criticality as a new avenue for coherence control in open quantum systems and quantum technologies."}

We also observe a second seemingly separate phenomenon: under fixed hyperparameters, the stochastic fine-tuning reward often rises, peaks, and then degrades in both ES and GRPO. We argue that both effects reflect a shared geometric property of fine-tuning landscapes: they are low-dimensional in curvature. A small set of high-curvature dimensions dominates improvement, producing (i) heterogeneous time scales that yield rise-then-decay under fixed stochasticity, as captured by a minimal quadratic stochastic-ascent model, and (ii) degenerate improving updates, where many random perturbations share similar components along these directions. Using ES as a geometric probe on fine-tuning reward landscapes of GSM8K, ARC-C, and WinoGrande across Qwen2.5-Instruct models (0.5B--7B), we show that reward-improving perturbations remain empirically accessible with small populations across scales. Together, these results reconcile ES scalability with non-monotonic training dynamics and suggest that high-dimensional fine-tuning may admit a broader class of viable optimization methods than worst-case theory implies."}

When modeling the dissociation of the nitrogen molecule with a (10e, 26o) active space, HSQD matches the accuracy of SQD on IBM quantum hardware using only half the number of qubits and 40% fewer measurements.\n  We further enhance HSQD with a heat-bath configuration interaction (HCI) inspired selection of the samples, forming HCI-HSQD.

For these systems, HCI-HSQD reduces SQD energy errors by up to 76% for [2Fe-2S] and 26% for [4Fe-4S], while also reducing subspace sizes, halving measurement requirements, and eliminating expensive post-processing.\n  Together, these results establish half-qubit SQD as a noise-resilient and resource-efficient pathway toward practical quantum advantage in strongly correlated chemistry."}

We introduce GASP (Guided Adversarial Self-Play), a robustification method that explicitly trains detect-and-repair capabilities using only outcome verification. Without human labels or external teachers, GASP forms an adversarial self-play game within a single model: a polluter learns to induce failure via locally coherent corruptions, while an agent learns to diagnose and recover under the same corrupted conditioning. To address the scarcity of successful recoveries early in training, we propose in-distribution repair guidance, an imitation term on self-generated repairs that increases recovery probability while preserving previously acquired capabilities. Across four open-weight models (1.5B--8B), GASP transforms strong-but-brittle reasoners into robust ones that withstand misleading and perturbed context while often improving clean accuracy. Further analysis shows that adversarial corruptions induce an effective curriculum, and in-distribution guidance enables rapid recovery learning with minimal representational drift."}

This dependency is particularly limiting for newly released benchmarks with minimal historical evaluation data. We argue that discrete correctness labels are a lossy view of the model's decision process and fail to capture information encoded in hidden states. To address this, we introduce REPCORE, which aligns heterogeneous hidden states into a unified latent space to construct representative coresets. Using these subsets for performance extrapolation, REPCORE achieves precise estimation accuracy with as few as ten source models. Experiments on five benchmarks and over 200 models show consistent gains over output-based baselines in ranking correlation and estimation accuracy. Spectral analysis further indicates that the aligned representations contain separable components reflecting broad response tendencies and task-specific reasoning patterns."}

Furthermore, we connect this stability guarantee to generalization, proving that the expected generalization error of any $(\\varepsilon, δ)$-QDP learning algorithm is bounded by the square root of the privacy-induced stability term.

In general, data-driven methods such as those based on deep learning, exhibit higher accuracy than traditional knowledge-based systems. These systems however, are not without significant limitations. The need for large labeled data sets, a lack of generalizibility to new environments (out-of-distribution generalization), and a lack of transparency at inference time are some of the obstacles to adoption in real world environments. In contrast, traditional approaches based on domain expertise in the form of rules, logic or first principles suffer from poor accuracy, many false positives and a need for ongoing expert supervision and manual tuning. While the majority of approaches in recent literature utilize some form of data-driven architecture, there are hybrid systems which also take into account domain specific knowledge. Such hybrid systems have the potential to overcome the weaknesses of either approach on its own while preserving their strengths. We propose taking the hybrid approach even further and integrating deep learning with symbolic logic, or Neuro-symbolic AI, to create more accurate, explainable, interpretable, and robust systems. We describe several neuro-symbolic architectures and examine their strengths and limitations within the PdM domain. We focus specifically on methods which involve the use of sensor data and manually crafted rules as inputs by describing concrete NeSy architectures.

The results reveal that the initial strength of magnetization plays a crucial role in the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions. In concrete terms, when quenching within the same phase, through the properties of observables such as Fisher zeros and magnetization, we show that the stronger the initial magnetization, the more difficult the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions. The underlying mechanism is that the strong initial magnetization provides a directional effect, which inhibits the spin flipping in the process of quantum quench, making the dynamical quantum phase transition difficult to emerge. Since dynamical quantum phase transitions can be experimentally realized in various artificial systems, we hope that the physics predicted here can be experimentally verified in tabletop platforms."}

Breeden"], "title": "How Understanding Forecast Uncertainty Resolves the Explainability Problem in Machine Learning Models", "comment": "22 pages; 2 figures", "summary": "For applications of machine learning in critical decisions, explainability is a primary concern, and often a regulatory requirement. Local linear methods for generating explanations, such as LIME and SHAP, have been criticized for being unstable near decision boundaries. In this paper, we explain that such concerns reflect a misunderstanding of the problem. The forecast uncertainty is high at decision boundaries, so consequently, the explanatory instability is high. The correct approach is to change the sequence of events and questions being asked. Nonlinear models can be highly predictive in some regions while having little or no predictability in others. Therefore, the first question is whether a usable forecast exists. When there is a forecast with low enough uncertainty to be useful, an explanation can be sought via a local linear approximation. In such cases, the explanatory instability is correspondingly low. When no usable forecast exists, the decision must fall to a simpler overall model such as traditional logistic regression. Additionally, these results show that some methods that purport to be explainable everywhere, such as ReLU networks or any piecewise linear model, have only an illusory explainability, because the forecast uncertainty at the segment boundaries is too high to be useful. Explaining an unusable forecast is pointless."}

However, brittle, prototype-derived architectures often plague industrial applications and a lack of systemic oversight, creating a ``responsibility vacuum'' where safety and accountability are compromised. This paper presents an industry case study of the ``Maria'' platform, a production-grade AI system in primary healthcare that addresses this gap.\n  Our central hypothesis is that trustworthy clinical AI is achieved through the holistic integration of four foundational engineering pillars. We present a synergistic architecture that combines Clean Architecture for maintainability with an Event-driven architecture for resilience and auditability. We introduce the Agent as the primary unit of modularity, each possessing its own autonomous MLOps lifecycle. Finally, we show how a Human-in-the-Loop governance model is technically integrated not merely as a safety check, but as a critical, event-driven data source for continuous improvement. We present the platform as a reference architecture, offering practical lessons for engineers building maintainable, scalable, and accountable AI-enabled systems in high-stakes domains."}

The framework enables systematic large-scale evaluation of a linearly mixed quantum-classical dual kernel of up to 784 qubits. Using Fashion-MNIST, the classification performance of the test dataset is compared between a classical kernel, a quantum kernel, and the quantum-classical dual kernel across the feature dimensions from 2 to 784, with a one-to-one mapping between encoded features and qubits. Our result shows that the quantum-classical dual kernel consistently outperforms both single-kernel baselines, remains stable as the dimensionality increases, and mitigates the large-scale degradation observed in the quantum kernel. Analysis of the learned mixing weights indicates that quantum contributions dominate below 128 features, while classical contributions become increasingly important beyond 128, suggesting that the classical kernel provides a stabilizing anchor against concentration effects and hardware noise while preserving quantum gains at lower dimensions."}

Most diffusion-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors exploit score magnitude or local geometry (energies, curvature, covariance spectra) and largely ignore equivariances. We introduce Group-Equivariant Posterior Consistency (GEPC), a training-free probe that measures how consistently the learned score transforms under a finite group $\\mathcal{G}$, detecting equivariance breaking even when score magnitude remains unchanged. At the population level, we propose the ideal GEPC residual, which averages an equivariance-residual functional over $\\mathcal{G}$, and we derive ID upper bounds and OOD lower bounds under mild assumptions. GEPC requires only score evaluations and produces interpretable equivariance-breaking maps. On OOD image benchmark datasets, we show that GEPC achieves competitive or improved AUROC compared to recent diffusion-based baselines while remaining computationally lightweight. On high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imagery where OOD corresponds to targets or anomalies in clutter, GEPC yields strong target-background separation and visually interpretable equivariance-breaking maps.

However, as the environment evolves during VLA execution, the optimal sparsity patterns change accordingly. Static pruning lacks the adaptability required for environment dynamics, whereas fixed-interval dynamic layer pruning suffers from coarse granularity and high retraining overheads. To bridge this gap, we propose EcoVLA, a training-free, plug-and-play adaptive pruning framework that supports orthogonal combination with existing VLA acceleration methods. EcoVLA comprises two components: Environment-aware Adaptive Pruning (EAP) and Interleaved Inference Orchestration ($I^2O$). EAP is a lightweight adaptive channel pruning method that incorporates the temporal consistency of the physical environment to update sparsity patterns. $I^2O$ leverages the FLOPs bubbles inherent in VLA inference to schedule the pruning method in parallel, ensuring negligible impact on latency. Evaluated on diverse VLA models and benchmarks, EcoVLA delivers state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 1.60$\\times$ speedup with only a 0.4% drop in success rate, and further reaches 2.18$\\times$ speedup with only a 0.5% degradation when combined with token pruning. We further validate the effectiveness of EcoVLA on real-world robots."}

To date, research into the design of noise-resilient quantum algorithms has been dominated by variational approaches, while alternatives remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel class of quantum optimisation heuristics that forgo this variational framework in favour of a hybrid quantum-classical approach built upon Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We introduce Quantum-enhanced Simulated Annealing (QeSA) and Quantum-enhanced Parallel Tempering (QePT), before validating these heuristics on hard Sherrington-Kirkpatrick instances and demonstrate their superior scaling over classical benchmarks. These algorithms are expected to exhibit inherent robustness to noise and support parallel execution across both quantum and classical resources with only classical communication required. As such, they offer a scalable and potentially competitive route toward solving large-scale optimisation problems with near-term quantum devices."}

We approach this challenge from a Bayesian perspective by focusing on the parameter space of flow matching and diffusion models and constructing a predictive posterior that better captures the variability of the data distribution. In particular, we capture the geometry of the loss using a Riemannian metric and leverage a flexible approximate posterior that adapts to the local structure of the loss landscape. This approach allows us to sample generative models that resemble the original model, but exhibit reduced memorisation. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces memorisation while preserving generalisation. Further, we provide a theoretical analysis of our method, which explains our findings. Overall, our work illustrates how considering the geometry of the loss enables effective use of the parameter space, even for complex high-dimensional generative models."}

However, these successes have not translated to complex domains where the cost of interaction is high, such as the physical cost of running robots, the time cost of ML engineering, and the resource cost of scientific experiments. The true bottleneck for achieving the next level of agent performance for these complex and high-cost domains lies in the expense of executing actions to acquire reward signals. To address this gap, this paper argues that we should use world models as an intermediary between agents and the real world. We discuss how world models, viewed as models of dynamics, rewards, and task distributions, can overcome fundamental barriers of high-cost actions such as extreme off-policy learning and sample inefficiency in long-horizon tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate how world models can provide critical and rich learning signals to agents across a broad set of domains, including machine learning engineering, computer use, robotics, and AI for science. Lastly, we identify the challenges of building these world models and propose actionable items along dataset curation, architecture design, scaling, and evaluation of world models."}

While prior efforts have explored empirical remedies, a theoretical understanding of such performance disparities in classification remains limited. In this work, we present Margin Regularization for Performance Disparity Reduction (MR$^2$), a theoretically principled regularization for classification by dynamically adjusting margins in both the logit and representation spaces. Our analysis establishes a margin-based, class-sensitive generalization bound that reveals how per-class feature variability contributes to error, motivating the use of larger margins for hard classes. Guided by this insight, MR$^2$ optimizes per-class logit margins proportional to feature spread and penalizes excessive representation margins to enhance intra-class compactness. Experiments on seven datasets, including ImageNet, and diverse pre-trained backbones (MAE, MoCov2, CLIP) demonstrate that MR$^2$ not only improves overall accuracy but also significantly boosts hard class performance without trading off easy classes, thus reducing performance disparity.

However, in real-world scenarios, the availability of modality data is often dynamic and uncertain, leading to substantial performance fluctuations due to the distribution shifts and semantic deficiencies of the incomplete multimodal inputs. Known as the missing modality issue, this challenge poses a critical barrier to the robustness and practical deployment of MAC models. To systematically quantify this issue, we introduce MissMAC-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to establish fair and unified evaluation standards from the perspective of cross-modal synergy. Two guiding principles are proposed, including no missing prior during training, and one single model capable of handling both complete and incomplete modality scenarios, thereby ensuring better generalization. Moreover, to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications, our benchmark integrates evaluation protocols with both fixed and random missing patterns at the dataset and instance levels. Extensive experiments conducted on 3 widely-used language models across 4 datasets validate the effectiveness of diverse MAC approaches in tackling the missing modality issue. Our benchmark provides a solid foundation for advancing robust multimodal affective computing and promotes the development of multimedia data mining."}

Ensemble methods are often adopted to mitigate these challenges by combining multiple detectors, which can reduce individual biases and increase robustness. Yet building an ensemble that is genuinely complementary remains challenging, since many detectors rely on similar decision cues and end up producing redundant anomaly scores. As a result, the potential of ensemble learning is often limited by the difficulty of identifying models that truly capture different types of irregularities. To address this, we propose a methodology for characterizing anomaly detectors through their decision mechanisms. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations, we quantify how each model attributes importance to input features, and we use these attribution profiles to measure similarity between detectors. We show that detectors with similar explanations tend to produce correlated anomaly scores and identify largely overlapping anomalies. Conversely, explanation divergence reliably indicates complementary detection behavior. Our results demonstrate that explanation-driven metrics offer a different criterion than raw outputs for selecting models in an ensemble. However, we also demonstrate that diversity alone is insufficient; high individual model performance remains a prerequisite for effective ensembles. By explicitly targeting explanation diversity while maintaining model quality, we are able to construct ensembles that are more diverse, more complementary, and ultimately more effective for unsupervised anomaly detection."}

Despite its promise, RLVR remains prohibitively resource-intensive, requiring extensive reward signals and incurring substantial rollout costs during training. In this work, we revisit the fundamental question of data and compute efficiency in RLVR. We first establish a theoretical lower bound on the sample complexity required to unlock reasoning capabilities, and empirically validate that strong performance can be achieved with a surprisingly small number of training instances. To tackle the computational burden, we propose Dynamic One-Shot Policy Refinement (DoPR), an uncertainty-aware RL strategy that dynamically selects a single informative training sample per batch for policy updates, guided by reward volatility and exploration-driven acquisition. DoPR reduces rollout overhead by nearly an order of magnitude while preserving competitive reasoning accuracy, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for LLM post-training. This approach offers a practical path toward more efficient and accessible RL-based training for reasoning-intensive LLM applications."}

To better understand LLM scaling, we study representational differences between LLMs and their smaller counterparts, with the goal of replicating the representational qualities of larger models in the smaller models. We observe a geometric phenomenon which we term $\\textbf{embedding condensation}$, where token embeddings collapse into a narrow cone-like subspace in some language models. Through systematic analyses across multiple Transformer families, we show that small models such as $\\texttt{GPT2}$ and $\\texttt{Qwen3-0.6B}$ exhibit severe condensation, whereas the larger models such as $\\texttt{GPT2-xl}$ and $\\texttt{Qwen3-32B}$ are more resistant to this phenomenon. Additional observations show that embedding condensation is not reliably mitigated by knowledge distillation from larger models. To fight against it, we formulate a dispersion loss that explicitly encourages embedding dispersion during training. Experiments demonstrate that it mitigates condensation, recovers dispersion patterns seen in larger models, and yields performance gains across 10 benchmarks. We believe this work offers a principled path toward improving smaller Transformers without additional parameters."}

Theoretically, we redefine information gain as uncertainty reduction over the model's belief states, establishing guarantees, including non-negativity, telescoping additivity, and channel monotonicity. Practically, to enable scalable optimization without manual retrieval annotations, we propose an output-aware intrinsic estimator that computes information gain directly from the model's output distributions using semantic clustering via bidirectional textual entailment. This intrinsic reward guides the policy to maximize epistemic progress, enabling efficient training via Group Relative Policy Optimxization (GRPO).

This, in turn, implies that there are several ways to define entropy production in finite-dimensional quantum systems, because the classical entropy production depends on temperature. We propose a unified definition of entropy production based on the difference in quantum relative entropy with respect to reference states characterized by effective temperatures. We demonstrate that the proposed definition naturally decomposes into a Clausius-type entropy production and an additional contribution arising from the time dependence of the effective temperature. Furthermore, we show that requiring the entropy production rate to take the conventional form as the sum of the entropy change and the heat flow constrains the effective temperature to be either constant or equal to a specific energy-matching effective temperature. For general initial states, entropy production can become negative, in which case we derive lower bounds on entropy production and establish sufficient conditions for its non-negativity using the trace distance."}

We propose Group Regularization Importance Persistence in 2 Dimensions (GRIP2), a deep knockoff feature importance statistic that integrates first-layer feature activity over a two-dimensional regularization surface controlling both sparsity strength and sparsification geometry. To approximate this surface integral in a single training run, we introduce efficient block-stochastic sampling, which aggregates feature activity magnitudes across diverse regularization regimes along the optimization trajectory. The resulting statistics are antisymmetric by construction, ensuring finite-sample FDR control. In extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-real data, GRIP2 demonstrates improved robustness to feature correlation and noise level: in high correlation and low signal-to-noise ratio regimes where standard deep learning based feature selectors may struggle, our method retains high power and stability.

We assess the intrinsic algorithmic performance of our methods through exact numerical simulations on a variety of quantum systems, including 8-qubit diagonally dominant matrices, 12-qubit one-dimensional Ising models, and a 10-qubit water molecule (H$_2$O) Hamiltonian. Our results show that both QJD and SBQJD achieve significantly faster convergence and require fewer Pauli measurements compared to the recently reported Quantum Davidson method, with SBQJD further benefiting from optimized reference state preparation. These findings establish the QJD framework as an efficient general-purpose subspace-based technique for solving quantum eigenvalue problems, providing a promising foundation for sparse Hamiltonian calculations on future fault-tolerant quantum hardware."}

Our best-performing model, Green-NAS-A, achieved an RMSE of 0.0988 (i.e., within 1.4% of our manually tuned baseline) using only 153k model parameters, which is 239 times fewer than other globally applied weather forecasting models, such as GraphCast. In addition, we also describe how the use of transfer learning will improve the weather forecasting accuracy by approximately 5.2%, in comparison to a naive approach of training a new model for each city, when there is limited historical weather data available for that city."}

To formalize this, we define the Cognitive Integrity Threshold (CIT) as the minimum comprehension required to preserve oversight, autonomy, and accountable participation under AI assistance. CIT does not require full reasoning reconstruction, nor does it constrain automation. It identifies the threshold beyond which oversight becomes procedural and contestability fails. We operatinalize CIT through three functional dimensions: (i) verification capacity, (ii) comprehension-preserving interaction, and (iii) institutional scaffolds for governance. This motivates a design and governance agenda that aligns human-AI interaction with cognitive sustainability in responsibility-critical settings."}

While control theories in the rapid-driving and slow-driving limits have been developed, to the best of our knowledge there is no general optimization method applicable to intermediate timescales. We introduce an optimal-control framework to minimize dissipated work and work variance, defined via the two-point measurement scheme, in open quantum systems governed by time-dependent Lindblad master equations. By introducing an auxiliary operator, we convert the history-dependent work variance into a time-local integral, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization beyond slow or rapid driving regimes. Applying our method, we find that in the coherent spin-boson model the optimized protocol can switch discontinuously between distinct locally optimal solutions as the relative weight between dissipation and fluctuations is varied. Moreover, for a single-level quantum dot coupled to a fermionic reservoir, the optimized fluctuation-minimizing protocol develops a qualitatively different multi-step structure that is not captured by approaches based on slow- or rapid-driving limits."}

While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass.

To ensure scalability, we introduce \\texttt{ActiveQueryAttention}, a sparse adjoint primitive that exploits the structure of the masking objective to reduce backward pass complexity. BoE achieves a superior Pareto frontier for inference-time scaling compared to existing unmasking methods, demonstrating that gradient-guided steering offers a mathematically principled and efficient path to robust non-autoregressive generation.

Such fragmentation prevents shared representation learning and limits cross-task generalization. By contrast, natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have been transformed by the foundation model paradigm: large-scale pretraining followed by task-specific adaptation. In this work, we introduce the foundation CAN model that demonstrates multi-objective downstream generalization using a single pretrained backbone. Our approach treats CAN data as a language: we pretrain on large-scale, unlabeled decoded CAN signals and fine-tune across heterogeneous auto insurance tasks. To enable this, we propose a unified tokenization scheme for mixed discrete-continuous signals and address challenges of temporal complexity and trip-specific variability. Our results show that one pretrained CAN model can adapt effectively to diverse predictive tasks, validating that the foundation modeling paradigm, proven in NLP and CV, also holds for CAN data.

However, most existing approaches operate at the level of output critique, patching surface errors while often failing to correct deeper reasoning flaws. We propose SELF-THOUGHT, a framework that introduces an intermediate step of task abstraction before solution refinement. Given an input and an initial response, the model first distills the task into a structured template that captures key variables, constraints, and problem structure. This abstraction then guides solution instantiation, grounding subsequent responses in a clearer understanding of the task and reducing error propagation. Crucially, we show that these abstractions can be transferred across models: templates generated by larger models can serve as structured guides for smaller LLMs, which typically struggle with intrinsic self-correction. By reusing distilled task structures, smaller models achieve more reliable refinements without heavy fine-tuning or reliance on external verifiers. Experiments across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that SELF-THOUGHT improves accuracy, robustness, and generalization for both large and small models, offering a scalable path toward more reliable self-correcting language systems."}

We find that the spontaneous emission rate (the dissipation rate in vacuum) is modified by the gravitational field. Specifically, this modification depends on the atom's dipole, the position of the atom relative to the source of the gravitational field, and the frequency of the scalar radiation emitted by the atom. Furthermore, we identify the parameter regimes in which the spontaneous emission rate is enhanced or suppressed by gravity. We also discuss how the modification arises from time dilation and dipole radiation in a weak gravitational field.

Our analysis yields three key insights: (1) The benefits of Easy-First decoding (prioritizing low-entropy tokens) are magnified as model error increases; (2) factorized parallel decoding introduces intrinsic sampling errors that can lead to arbitrary large Reverse KL divergence, capturing \"incoherence\" failures that standard Forward KL metrics overlook; and (3) while verification can eliminate sampling error, it incurs an exponential cost governed by the total correlation within a block.

We derive our formulation by decomposing the conventional formulation's Taylor expansion into expressions over symmetric chains of tensor products. We exploit their symmetry to obtain feed-forward transformations that efficiently map queries and keys to coordinates in a minimal polynomial-kernel feature basis. Notably, cost is fixed inversely in proportion to head size, enabling application over a greater number of heads per token than otherwise feasible. We implement our formulation and empirically validate its correctness.

But, recent works have established that in many situations such Markovian descriptions are fundamentally limited: they cannot simultaneously capture populations and coherences even to the leading-order in system-bath couplings. This can cause violation of fundamental properties like thermalization and continuity equations associated with local conservation laws, even when such properties are expected in the actual setting. This begs the question: given a physical situation, how do we know if there exists an LE that describes it to a desired accuracy? Here we show that, for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), this question can be succinctly formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), a convex optimization technique. If a solution to the SDP can be found to a desired accuracy, then an LE description is possible for the chosen setting. If not, no LE description is fundamentally attainable, showing that a consistent Markovian treatment is impossible even at weak system-bath coupling for that particular setting. Considering few qubit isotropic XXZ-type models coupled to multiple baths, we find that in most parameter regimes, LE description giving accurate populations and coherences to leading-order is unattainable, leading to rigorous no-go results. However, in some cases, LE description having correct populations but inaccurate coherences, and satisfying local conservation laws, is possible over some of the parameter regimes.

However, we identify a critical representation paradox, termed Latent Chaos: models with accurate predictions often learn latent representations that are temporally disordered and lack continuity. We attribute this phenomenon to the dominant observation-space forecasting paradigm. Most TSF models minimize point-wise errors on noisy and partially observed data, which encourages shortcut solutions instead of the recovery of underlying system dynamics. To address this issue, we propose Latent Time Series Forecasting (LatentTSF), a novel paradigm that shifts TSF from observation regression to latent state prediction. Specifically, LatentTSF employs an AutoEncoder to project observations at each time step into a higher-dimensional latent state space. This expanded representation aims to capture underlying system variables and impose a smoother temporal structure. Forecasting is then performed entirely in the latent space, allowing the model to focus on learning structured temporal dynamics. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our proposed latent objectives implicitly maximize mutual information between predicted latent states and ground-truth states and observations. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks confirm that LatentTSF effectively mitigates latent chaos, achieving superior performance.

We introduce TheoryCoder-2, a new TBRL agent that leverages LLMs' in-context learning ability to actively learn reusable abstractions rather than relying on hand-specified ones, by synthesizing abstractions from experience and integrating them into a hierarchical planning process. We conduct experiments on diverse environments, including BabyAI, Minihack and VGDL games like Sokoban.

A promising route to understanding this quantum thermalization is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which posits that individual energy eigenstates already appear locally thermal. Subsequent studies have extended this concept to the full ETH, which captures higher-order correlations among matrix elements through nontrivial relations. In this work, we perform a detailed exact-diagonalization study of finite-size corrections to these relations in the canonical ensemble. We distinguish two distinct sources of corrections: those arising from energy fluctuations, which decay polynomially with system size, and those originating from fluctuations within each energy window, which decay exponentially with system size. In particular, our analysis resolves the puzzle that, for certain observables, finite-size corrections exhibit anomalous growth with increasing system size even in chaotic systems.

For multi-step, state-dependent analytical tasks, this is a mistake. Building on Woods (1984) Keyhole Effect, the cognitive cost of viewing large information spaces through narrow viewports, I show that chat interfaces systematically degrade analytical performance through five mechanisms: (1) constant content displacement defeats hippocampal spatial memory systems; (2) hidden state variables exceed working memory capacity (approximately 4 chunks under load); (3) forced verbalization triggers verbal overshadowing, degrading visual pattern recognition; (4) linear text streams block epistemic action and cognitive offloading; (5) serialization penalties scale with data dimensionality. I formalize cognitive overload as O = max(0, m - v - W) where m is task-relevant items, v is visible items, and W is working memory capacity. When O > 0, error probability increases and analytical biases (anchoring, confirmation, change blindness) amplify. Eight hybrid design patterns address these failures: Generative UI, Infinite Canvas, Deictic Interaction, State Rail, Ghost Layers, Mise en Place, Semantic Zoom, and Probabilistic UI. Each pattern targets specific cognitive bottlenecks while preserving natural language for intent specification and synthesis. Well-scaffolded conversational systems that encode expert priors may reduce load for guided tasks; the framework applies most strongly to open-ended exploration. The paper concludes with falsifiable hypotheses and experimental paradigms for empirical validation."}

Remarkably, the same functions also arise in spin models, including the Ising and Heisenberg models, where distinct interaction structures correspond to different matrix functions. This correspondence has been used to establish the classical hardness of simulating interacting spin systems by relating their output distributions to #P-hard quantities. Previous works, however, have largely been restricted to bipartite spin interactions, where transition amplitudes, which provide the leading-order contribution to the output probabilities, are proportional to the permanent. In this work, we extend the Ising model construction to arbitrary interaction networks and show that transition amplitudes of the Ising Hamiltonian are proportional to the hafnian and the loop-hafnian. The loop-hafnian generalizes both the permanent and hafnian, but unlike these cases, loop-hafnian-based states require Dicke-like superpositions, making the design of corresponding quantum circuits non-trivial. Our results establish a unified framework linking bosonic networks of single photons and Gaussian states with quantum spin dynamics and matrix functions. This unification not only broadens the theoretical foundation of quantum circuit models but also highlights new, diverse, and classically intractable applications."}

Training is performed using a zeroth-order optimizer, since backpropagation through long, recurrent Ising-machine dynamics leads to unstable and poorly informative gradients. We call this approach a neural network parameterized Ising machine (NPIM). Despite its low parameter count, the learned dynamics recover effective algorithmic structure, including momentum-like behavior and time-varying schedules, enabling efficient search in highly non-convex energy landscapes.

In this structure, the number of repetitions of the basic circuit pattern is associated to convergence parameters. This iterative structure behaves similarly to function approximation by series expansion: the higher the truncation order, the better the target gate (i.e. operation) approximation. The asymptotic convergence of the gate error with respect to the number of basic pattern repetitions is known. It is referred to as the query complexity. The underlying convergence law is bounded, but not in an explicit fashion. Upper bounds are generally too pessimistic to be useful in practice. The actual convergence law contains constants that depend on the joint properties of the matrix encoded by the query and the initial state vector, which are difficult to compute classically. This paper proposes a strategy to study this convergence law and extract the associated constants from the gate (operation) approximation at different accuracy (convergence parameter) constructed directly on a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). This protocol is called Numerical Error Extraction by Quantum Measurement Algorithm (NEEQMA). NEEQMA concepts are tested on specific instances of Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Hamiltonian Simulation by Trotterization. Knowing theexact convergence constants allows for selecting the smallest convergence parameters that enable reaching the required gate approximation accuracy, hence satisfying the quantum algorithm's requirements."}

Standard benchmarks cannot answer this because they lack access to the true posterior p(y|x). We use class-conditional normalizing flows as oracles that make exact posteriors tractable on realistic images (AFHQ, ImageNet). This enables five lines of investigation. Scaling laws: Prediction error decomposes into irreducible aleatoric uncertainty and reducible epistemic error; the epistemic component follows a power law in dataset size, continuing to shrink even when total loss plateaus. Limits of learning: The aleatoric floor is exactly measurable, and architectures differ markedly in how they approach it: ResNets exhibit clean power-law scaling while Vision Transformers stall in low-data regimes. Soft labels: Oracle posteriors contain learnable structure beyond class labels: training with exact posteriors outperforms hard labels and yields near-perfect calibration. Distribution shift: The oracle computes exact KL divergence of controlled perturbations, revealing that shift type matters more than shift magnitude: class imbalance barely affects accuracy at divergence values where input noise causes catastrophic degradation. Active learning: Exact epistemic uncertainty distinguishes genuinely informative samples from inherently ambiguous ones, improving sample efficiency.

Here, we construct and investigate a Liouvillian exceptional structure based on a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit. Through numerical simulations, we reveal a quantum phase transition occurring at the LEP characterized by a sudden change in dynamical behavior from underdamped oscillations to overdamped relaxations as visualized via Wigner functions and Bloch sphere trajectories. Notably the negativity of the Wigner function serves as a direct signature of genuine quantum coherence unattainable in conventional single-qubit non-Hermitian systems. Furthermore, we introduce the phase difference between the off-diagonal elements of the Liouvillian eigenmatrices as a novel parameter to quantify the transition. Our results establish the Kerr-cat qubit as a novel continuous-variable setting for exploring dissipative quantum criticality and intrinsic non-Hermitian physics."}

To address this threat, modern bot detectors increasingly rely on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the effectiveness of these GNN-based detectors in real-world settings remains poorly understood. In practice, attackers continuously adapt their strategies as well as must operate under domain-specific and temporal constraints, which can fundamentally limit the applicability of existing attack methods. As a result, there is a critical need for robust GNN-based bot detection methods under realistic, constraint-aware attack scenarios.\n  To address this gap, we introduce BOCLOAK to systematically evaluate the robustness of GNN-based social bot detection via both edge editing and node injection adversarial attacks under realistic constraints. BOCLOAK constructs a probability measure over spatio-temporal neighbor features and learns an optimal transport geometry that separates human and bot behaviors. It then decodes transport plans into sparse, plausible edge edits that evade detection while obeying real-world constraints. We evaluate BOCLOAK across three social bot datasets, five state-of-the-art bot detectors, three adversarial defenses, and compare it against four leading graph adversarial attack baselines. BOCLOAK achieves up to 80.13% higher attack success rates while using 99.80% less GPU memory under realistic real-world constraints. Most importantly, BOCLOAK shows that optimal transport provides a lightweight, principled framework for bridging the gap between adversarial attacks and real-world bot detection."}

Motivated by this observation, we propose MixDPO, a simple yet effective difficulty-aware training strategy that (i) orders preference data from easy to hard (a curriculum over margin-defined difficulty), and (ii) routes difficult pairs to an SFT objective while applying a preference loss to easy pairs. This hybrid design provides a practical mechanism to leverage ambiguous pairs without incurring the optimization failures often associated with preference losses on low-margin data. Across three LLM-judge benchmarks, MixDPO consistently improves alignment over DPO and a range of widely-used variants, with particularly strong gains on AlpacaEval~2 length-controlled (LC) win rate."}

Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate.

Harvest treats peer GPU memory as a transient cache tier, preserving correctness while reducing data movement overhead under dynamic memory availability.

Despite its widespread adoption, this assumption has rarely been examined empirically. In this paper, we systematically investigate this assumption by introducing a Linear Effect Attribution System(LEAS), which provides quantitative evidence of interference between reasoning and tool-use behaviors. Through an in-depth analysis, we show that these two capabilities often induce misaligned gradient directions, leading to training interference that undermines the effectiveness of joint optimization and challenges the prevailing ARL paradigm.

We measure background quasiparticle tunneling rates at the single-hertz level, with temporal resolution of tens of microseconds. Using time-tagged coincidence analysis, we show that individual events are uncorrelated across devices, whereas burst episodes occur about once per minute and are largely correlated.

However, existing prototype-based models are primarily designed for standard RGB image data and are not optimized for the distinct, variable-specific channels commonly found in geoscientific image and raster datasets. In this study, we develop a prototype-based XAI approach tailored for multi-channel geospatial data, where each channel represents a distinct physical environmental variable or spectral channel. Our approach enables the model to identify separate, channel-specific prototypical characteristics sourced from multiple distinct training examples that inform how these features individually and in combination influence model prediction while achieving comparable performance to standard neural networks. We demonstrate this method through two geoscientific case studies: (1) classification of Madden Julian Oscillation phases using multi-variable climate data and (2) land-use classification from multispectral satellite imagery. This approach produces both local (instance-level) and global (model-level) explanations for providing insights into feature-relevance across channels.

We show that the direction of behavioral drift is determined by a covariance under the base policy between endorsing the belief signal in the prompt and the learned reward, and that the first-order effect reduces to a simple mean-gap condition. We then analyze reward learning from pairwise comparisons under random utility models like Bradley-Terry and characterize when bias in human annotators' preferences induces this reward gap. Next, we propose a training-time intervention designed to neutralize the amplification mechanism itself. Among all post-trained policies that prevent sycophantic behavior from increasing, we characterize the unique policy closest in KL divergence to the unconstrained post-trained policy, and derive the corresponding minimal reward correction as a closed-form agreement penalty.

Our results uncover three distinct phenomena: (i) we obtain an exponential separation between $\\QSQ$ and $\\SQ$ on a permutation-invariant function class; (ii) we establish query complexity lower bounds for $\\QSQ$ learning that match, up to constant factors, the corresponding classical $\\SQ$ lower bounds for most commonly studied symmetries; however, the potential advantages may occur under highly skewed orbit distributions; and (iii) we further identify a tolerance-based separation exists, where quantum learners succeed at noise levels that render classical $\\SQ$ algorithms ineffective.

A quantum clock is defined by the following properties: (a) the time that the clock shows is non-decreasing, (b) the clock ticks at random with random tick sizes, and (c) on average the clock shows the Newtonian time. We show that the leading term in the evolution equation for the density matrix associated with any quantum clock model gives the von Neumann equation. Modifications to the von Neumann equation are worked out in detail in a parametric family of examples for which the tick sizes have a gamma distribution. The leading correction to the von Neumann equation is given by the Lindblad equation generated by the Hamiltonian, but there are higher-order terms that generalize the von Neumann equation and the Lindblad equation. Lower bounds on the parameters of these quantum clock models are derived by use of the precision limit of an atomic clock."}

In the semiclassical limit, exponential complexity growth arises from hyperbolic trajectories, and asymptotically linear Lanczos growth appears as a universal chaotic fixed point, with sub-leading deformations classified as irrelevant, marginal or relevant. Going beyond the saddle, the Schwinger-Keldysh framework provides controlled access to fluctuations and large deviations of Krylov complexity, revealing sharp signatures of integrability-chaos crossovers that are invisible at the level of the mean.

A critical bottleneck in this context is how to load classical or quantum data into quantum circuits efficiently. Approximate quantum loaders (AQLs) provide a viable solution to this problem by balancing fidelity and circuit complexity. However, most existing AQL methods are either heuristic or provide guarantees only for specific input types, and a general theoretical framework is still lacking. To address this gap, here we reformulate most AQL methods into a unified framework and establish information-theoretic bounds on their approximation error. Our analysis reveals that the achievable infidelity between the prepared state and target state scales linearly with the total entanglement entropy across subsystems when the loading circuit is applied to the target state. In light of this, we develop AQER, a scalable AQL method that constructs the loading circuit by systematically reducing entanglement in target states. We conduct systematic experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of AQER, using synthetic datasets, classical image and language datasets, and a quantum many-body state datasets with up to 50 qubits.

This self-referential setup enables surprisingly strong quality recovery after aggressive pruning.\n  Our experiments reveal an unexpected finding: self-referential distillation alone, applied post-training under an identical objective and fixed calibration dataset, improves model quality by 39% relative to the original converged checkpoint.

Current Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and standards like FHIR are designed for human review, creating a \"Context Mismatch\": AI agents receive fragmented data and must rely on probabilistic inference (e.g., RAG) to reconstruct patient history. This approach causes hallucinations and hinders auditability. Methods: We propose MedBeads, an agent-native data infrastructure where clinical events are immutable \"Beads\"--nodes in a Merkle Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)--cryptographically referencing causal predecessors. This \"write-once, read-many\" architecture makes tampering mathematically detectable. We implemented a prototype with a Go Core Engine, Python middleware for LLM integration, and a React-based visualization interface. Results: We successfully implemented the workflow using synthetic data. The FHIR-to-DAG conversion transformed flat resources into a causally-linked graph. Our Breadth-First Search (BFS) Context Retrieval algorithm traverses relevant subgraphs with O(V+E) complexity, enabling real-time decision support. Tamper-evidence is guaranteed by design: any modification breaks the cryptographic chain. The visualization aids clinician understanding through explicit causal links. Conclusion: MedBeads addresses the \"Context Mismatch\" by shifting from probabilistic search to deterministic graph traversal, and from mutable records to immutable chains, providing the substrate for \"Trustworthy Medical AI.\" It guarantees the context the AI receives is deterministic and tamper-evident, while the LLM determines interpretation.

This robustness, however, is not absolute. We identify a simple yet effective failure mode, termed context nesting, where harmful requests are embedded within structured benign contexts, effectively bypassing the stepwise reduction mechanism.

In this work, we introduce a principled framework for understanding RLVR instability through the lens of objective-level hacking. Unlike reward hacking, which arises from exploitable verifiers, objective-level hacking emerges from token-level credit misalignment and is manifested as system-level spurious signals in the optimization objective. Grounded in our framework, together with extensive experiments on a 30B MoE model, we trace the origin and formalize the mechanism behind a key pathological training dynamic in MoE models: the abnormal growth of the training-inference discrepancy, a phenomenon widely associated with instability but previously lacking a mechanistic explanation. These findings provide a concrete and causal account of the training dynamics underlying instabilities in MoE models, offering guidance for the design of stable RLVR algorithms."}

In particular, intrinsic quantum noise provides a natural stochastic resource that, when rigorously analyzed within the differential privacy (DP) framework and composed with classical mechanisms, can satisfy formal $(\\varepsilon, δ)$-DP guarantees. This enables a reduction in the required classical perturbation without compromising the privacy budget, potentially improving model utility.

While modern diagnostic systems primarily rely on sequences of vehicular Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) registered in On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) systems, they often overlook valuable contextual information such as raw sensory data (e.g., temperature, humidity, and pressure). This contextual data, crucial for domain experts to classify vehicle failures, introduces unique challenges due to its complexity and the noisy nature of real-world data. This paper presents BiCarFormer: the first multimodal approach to multi-label sequence classification of error codes into error patterns that integrates DTC sequences and environmental conditions. BiCarFormer is a bidirectional Transformer model tailored for vehicle event sequences, employing embedding fusions and a co-attention mechanism to capture the relationships between diagnostic codes and environmental data. Experimental results on a challenging real-world automotive dataset with 22,137 error codes and 360 error patterns demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance compared to models that rely solely on DTC sequences and traditional sequence models.

Existing FFN sparsification methods, designed for autoregressive decoding, fail to exploit the prefill stage's parallelism and often degrade accuracy. To address this, we introduce FastForward, a predictive sparsity framework that accelerates LLM prefill through block-wise, context-aware FFN sparsity. FastForward combines (1) a lightweight expert predictor to select high-importance neurons per block, (2) an error compensation network to correct sparsity-induced errors, and (3) a layer-wise sparsity scheduler to allocate compute based on token-mixing importance.

However, the efficacy of such heterogeneous networks is often compromised by the conflict between limited onboard resources and stringent stability requirements. Moving beyond traditional throughput-centric designs, we propose a Sensing-Communication-Computing-Control closed-loop framework that explicitly models the impact of communication latency on physical control stability. To guarantee mission reliability, we leverage the Lyapunov stability theory to derive an intrinsic mapping between the state evolution of the control system and communication constraints, transforming abstract stability requirements into quantifiable resource boundaries. Then, we formulate the resource allocation problem as a Stackelberg game, where UAVs (as leaders) dynamically price resources to balance load and ensure stability, while users (as followers) optimize requests based on service urgency. Furthermore, addressing the prohibitive computational overhead of standard Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) on energy-constrained edge platforms, we propose a novel and lightweight pruning-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. By integrating a dynamic structured pruning mechanism, the proposed algorithm significantly compresses the neural network scale during training, enabling the UAV to rapidly approximate the game equilibrium with minimal inference latency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively secures control loop stability while maximizing system utility in dynamic low-altitude environments."}

While classical AI-based methods have been developed for early diagnosis and stage classification of AD, growing data volumes and limited computational resources necessitate faster, more efficient approaches. Quantum-based AI methods, which leverage superposition and entanglement principles along with high-dimensional Hilbert space, can surpass classical approaches' limitations and offer higher accuracy for high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and noisy data. In this study, a Quantum-Based Parallel Model (QBPM) architecture is proposed for the efficient classification of AD stages using MRI datasets, inspired by the principles of classical model parallelism. The proposed model leverages quantum advantages by employing two distinct quantum circuits, each incorporating rotational and entanglement blocks, running in parallel on the same quantum simulator. The classification performance of the model was evaluated on two different datasets to assess its overall robustness and generalization capability. The proposed model demonstrated high classification accuracy across both datasets, highlighting its overall robustness and generalization capability. Results obtained under high-level Gaussian noise, simulating real-world conditions, further provided experimental evidence for the model's applicability not only in theoretical but also in practical scenarios. Moreover, compared with five different classical transfer learning methods, the proposed model demonstrated its efficiency as an alternative to classical approaches by achieving higher classification accuracy and comparable execution time while utilizing fewer circuit parameters. The results indicate that the proposed QBPM architecture represents an innovative and powerful approach for the classification of stages in complex diseases such as Alzheimer's."}

In detail, we investigate how input tokens access memory locations within FFN parameters and the importance of FFN memory across different downstream tasks. MemoryLLM achieves context-free FFNs by training them in isolation from self-attention directly using the token embeddings. This approach allows FFNs to be pre-computed as token-wise lookups (ToLs), enabling on-demand transfer between VRAM and storage, additionally enhancing inference efficiency.

We identify two long-term memory-specific risks: cross-domain leakage, where LLMs inappropriately inject context from the long-term memories; and memory-induced sycophancy, where stored long-term memories insidiously reinforce user biases. We evaluate 18 frontier and open-source LLMs on our benchmark. Our results reveal a surprisingly high failure rate across these LLMs - a median failure rate of 53% on cross-domain samples and 97% on sycophancy samples.

This formulation enables an efficient ranking of a large number of candidate block-removal configurations and yields many high-quality, non-trivial solutions beyond consecutive regions. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art block-removal methods across several benchmarks, with performance gains persisting after short retraining, and reaching improvements of up to 6 points on the MMLU benchmark. Our method requires only forward and backward passes for a few active parameters, together with an (at least approximate) Ising solver, and can be readily applied to any architecture.

This reflects a competition between non-adiabatic quench-driven excitations and QR, giving rise to local minima of the defect densities at optimal annealing times. These times and the corresponding local minima are shown to scale as universal power laws with the rate of QR. Additional results for the scaling of the mean excess energy suggest that a system driven across a quantum critical point exhibits the same scaling behavior under a linear quench with QR as with uncorrelated noise."}

To solve this issue, Federated Graph Neural Networks (FedGNNs) are proposed to facilitate collaborative learning over decentralized local graph data, aiming to preserve user privacy. Yet, emerging research indicates that even in these settings, shared model updates, particularly gradients, can unintentionally leak sensitive information of local users. Numerous privacy inference attacks have been explored in traditional federated learning and extended to graph settings, but the problem of label distribution inference in FedGNNs remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fed-Listing (Federated Label Distribution Inference in GNNs), a novel gradient-based attack designed to infer the private label statistics of target clients in FedGNNs without access to raw data or node features. Fed-Listing only leverages the final-layer gradients exchanged during training to uncover statistical patterns that reveal class proportions in a stealthy manner. An auxiliary shadow dataset is used to generate diverse label partitioning strategies, simulating various client distributions, on which the attack model is obtained. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three GNN architectures show that Fed-Listing significantly outperforms existing baselines, including random guessing and Decaf, even under challenging non-i.i.d. scenarios. Moreover, applying defense mechanisms can barely reduce our attack performance, unless the model's utility is severely degraded."}

This paper introduces CAREP (Causal Automated Reasoning for Error Patterns), a multi-agent system that automatizes the generation of EP rules from high-dimensional event sequences of DTCs. CAREP combines a causal discovery agent that identifies potential DTC-EP relations, a contextual information agent that integrates metadata and descriptions, and an orchestrator agent that synthesizes candidate boolean rules together with interpretable reasoning traces.

An Empirical Study of Task-Interfering Layers in Vision-Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Current VLMs have demonstrated capabilities across a wide range of multimodal tasks. Typically, in a pretrained VLM, all layers are engaged by default to make predictions on downstream tasks. We find that intervening on a single layer, such as by zeroing its parameters, can improve the performance on certain tasks, indicating that some layers hinder rather than help downstream tasks. We systematically investigate how individual layers influence different tasks via layer intervention. Specifically, we measure the change in performance relative to the base model after intervening on each layer and observe improvements when bypassing specific layers. This improvement can be generalizable across models and datasets, indicating the presence of Task-Interfering Layers that harm downstream tasks' performance. We introduce Task-Layer Interaction Vector, which quantifies the effect of intervening on each layer of a VLM given a task. These task-interfering layers exhibit task-specific sensitivity patterns: tasks requiring similar capabilities show consistent response trends under layer interventions, as evidenced by the high similarity in their task-layer interaction vectors. Inspired by these findings, we propose TaLo (Task-Adaptive Layer Knockout), a training-free, test-time adaptation method that dynamically identifies and bypasses the most interfering layer for a given task. Without parameter updates, TaLo improves performance across various models and datasets, including boosting Qwen-VL's accuracy on the Maps task in ScienceQA by up to 16.6%.

Although AutoML methods for classification are able to deal with data imperfections, such as outliers, multiple scales and missing data, their behavior is less known on dirty categorical datasets. These datasets often have several categorical features with high cardinality arising from issues such as lack of curation and automated collection. Recent research has shown that ML models can benefit from morphological encoders for dirty categorical data, leading to significantly superior predictive performance. However the effects of using such encoders in AutoML methods are not known at the moment. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that transforms categorical data into numerical data so that an AutoML can handle categorical data transformed by more advanced encoding schemes. We benchmark the current robustness of AutoML methods on a set of dirty datasets and compare it with the proposed pipeline. This allows us to get insight on differences in predictive performance. We also look at the ML pipelines built by AutoMLs in order to gain insight beyond the best model as typically returned by these methods."}

Existing studies usually enhance the reasoning efficiency of LLMs by compressing CoT sequences. However, this approach conflicts with test-time scaling, limiting the reasoning capacity of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an efficient reasoning framework that models the reasoning process of LLMs as a state-transition process. Specifically, we first apply a linear attention mechanism to estimate the LLM's reasoning state, which records the historical reasoning information from previous reasoning steps. Then, based on the query prompt and the reasoning state, the LLM can efficiently perform the current reasoning step and update the state. With the linear attention, each token in the current reasoning step can directly retrieve relevant historical reasoning information from the reasoning state, without explicitly attending to tokens in previous reasoning steps. In this way, the computational complexity of attention is reduced from quadratic to linear, significantly improving the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. In addition, we propose a state-based reasoning strategy to mitigate the over-thinking issue caused by noisy reasoning steps. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and model sizes demonstrate that our framework not only improves the reasoning efficiency of LLMs but also enhances their reasoning performance."}

In this paper, we present Workflow-R1, a framework that reformulates workflow construction as a multi-turn, natural language-based sequential decision-making process. To resolve the optimization granularity mismatch inherent in such multi-turn interactions, we introduce Group Sub-sequence Policy Optimization (GSsPO). While explicitly tailored to align with the interleaved Think-Action dynamics of agentic reasoning, GSsPO fundamentally functions as a structure-aware RL algorithm generalizable to a broad class of multi-turn agentic sequential decision-making tasks. By recalibrating the optimization unit to the composite sub-sequence, specifically the atomic Think-Action cycle, it aligns gradient updates with the semantic boundaries of these interactions, ensuring robust learning in complex multi-turn reasoning tasks. Through extensive experiments on multiple QA benchmarks, Workflow-R1 outperforms competitive baselines, validating GSsPO as a generalized solution for sequential reasoning and establishing Workflow-R1 as a promising new paradigm for automated workflow optimization."}

This thesis introduces gSMILE, a unified framework for the explainability of generative models, extending the Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations (SMILE) method to generative settings. gSMILE employs controlled perturbations of textual input, Wasserstein distance metrics, and weighted surrogate modelling to quantify and visualise how specific components of a prompt or instruction influence model outputs. Applied to Large Language Models (LLMs), gSMILE provides fine-grained token-level attribution and generates intuitive heatmaps that highlight influential tokens and reasoning pathways. In instruction-based image editing models, the exact text-perturbation mechanism is employed, allowing for the analysis of how modifications to an editing instruction impact the resulting image. Combined with a scenario-based evaluation strategy grounded in the Operational Design Domain (ODD) framework, gSMILE allows systematic assessment of model behaviour across diverse semantic and environmental conditions. To evaluate explanation quality, we define rigorous attribution metrics, including stability, fidelity, accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness, and apply them across multiple generative architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that gSMILE produces robust, human-aligned attributions and generalises effectively across state-of-the-art generative models. These findings highlight the potential of gSMILE to advance transparent, reliable, and responsible deployment of generative AI technologies."}

We propose Private Mask Pre-Training (PMP), a pre-training framework that concentrates representation learning into a sparse subnetwork identified early in training. The binary mask defining this subnetwork is kept private, and only the final dense weights are released. This forces unauthorized fine-tuning without access to the mask to update parameters misaligned with pretraining subspace, inducing an intrinsic mismatch between the fine-tuning objective and the pre-training geometry. We provide theoretical analysis showing that this mismatch destabilizes gradient-based adaptation and bounds fine-tuning gains. Empirical results on large language models demonstrating that PMP preserves base model performance while consistently degrading unauthorized fine-tuning across a wide range of downstream tasks, with the strength of non-fine-tunability controlled by the mask ratio."}

Facing these challenges, we propose SAGE (Stability-Aware Gradient Efficiency), a dynamic framework designed to enhance alignment reliability by maximizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of policy updates. Concretely, SAGE integrates a coarse-grained curriculum mechanism that refreshes candidate pools based on model competence with a fine-grained, stability-aware scoring function that prioritizes informative, confident errors while filtering out unstable samples. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAGE significantly accelerates convergence and outperforms static baselines, highlighting the critical role of policy-aware, stability-conscious data selection in reasoning alignment."}

FutureMind introduces a dynamic reasoning pipeline composed of four key modules: Problem Analysis, Logical Reasoning, Strategy Planning, and Retrieval Guidance.

In such settings, single-agent systems are vulnerable to self-reinforcing errors, as their predictions lack independent validation and can drift toward spurious conclusions. Although recent multi-agent frameworks attempt to mitigate this issue through collaborative reasoning, their interactions are often shallow and loosely structured, failing to reflect the rigorous, evidence-driven processes used by clinical experts. More fundamentally, existing approaches largely ignore the rich logical dependencies among diseases, such as mutual exclusivity, pathological compatibility, and diagnostic confusion. This limitation prevents them from ruling out clinically implausible hypotheses, even when sufficient evidence is available. To overcome these, we propose RE-MCDF, a relation-enhanced multi-expert clinical diagnosis framework. RE-MCDF introduces a generation--verification--revision closed-loop architecture that integrates three complementary components: (i) a primary expert that generates candidate diagnoses and supporting evidence, (ii) a laboratory expert that dynamically prioritizes heterogeneous clinical indicators, and (iii) a multi-relation awareness and evaluation expert group that explicitly enforces inter-disease logical constraints. Guided by a medical knowledge graph (MKG), the first two experts adaptively reweight EMR evidence, while the expert group validates and corrects candidate diagnoses to ensure logical consistency.

Under review", "summary": "While open sourced Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have proliferated, selecting the optimal pretrained model for a specific downstream task remains challenging. Exhaustive evaluation is often infeasible due to computational constraints and data limitations in few shot scenarios. Existing selection methods fail to fully address this: they either rely on data-intensive proxies or use symmetric textual descriptors that neglect the inherently directional and model-specific nature of transferability. To address this problem, we propose a framework that grounds model selection in the internal functional dynamics of the visual encoder. Our approach represents each task via layer wise conductance and derives a target-conditioned block importance distribution through entropy regularized alignment. Building on this, we introduce Directional Conductance Divergence (DCD), an asymmetric metric that quantifies how effectively a source task covers the target's salient functional blocks. This allows for predicting target model rankings by aggregating source task ranks without direct inference. Experimental results on 48 VLMs across 21 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 14.7% improvement in NDCG@5 over SWAB."}

Our method treats states as optimization variables (\"virtual states\") with soft dynamics constraints, enabling parallel computation and easier optimization. To facilitate exploration and avoid local optima, we introduce stochasticity into the states. To mitigate sensitive gradients through high-dimensional vision-based world models, we modify the gradient structure to descend towards valid plans while only requiring action-input gradients. Our planner, which we call GRASP (Gradient RelAxed Stochastic Planner), can be viewed as a stochastic version of a non-condensed or collocation-based optimal controller.

Unlike softmax, where class regions are defined implicitly through coupled inequalities among logits, each PUNN partition function $h_i$ directly defines the probability of class $i$ as a standalone function of $x$.\n  We prove that PUNN is dense in the space of continuous probability maps on compact domains.

In many practical settings, the graphical model remains fixed while inference must be performed repeatedly for varying evidence patterns. Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms scale to large models but rely on myopic best-improvement rule that prioritizes immediate likelihood gains and often stagnate in poor local optima. Heuristics such as Guided Local Search (GLS+) partially alleviate this limitation by modifying the search landscape, but their guidance cannot be reused effectively across multiple inference queries on the same model. We propose a neural amortization framework for improving local search in this repeated-query regime. Exploiting the fixed graph structure, we train an attention-based network to score local moves by predicting their ability to reduce Hamming distance to a near-optimal solution. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing local search procedures, using this signal to balance short-term likelihood gains with long-term promise during neighbor selection. We provide theoretical intuition linking distance-reducing move selection to improved convergence behavior, and empirically demonstrate consistent improvements over SLS and GLS+ on challenging high-treewidth benchmarks in the amortized inference setting."}

At inference time, the agent intervenes only when a calibrated probability of user acceptance exceeds a threshold derived from asymmetric costs of missed help and false alarms. Inspired by festina lente (Latin: \"make haste slowly\"), we gate by an acceptance-calibrated, cost-derived threshold and invoke a resource-intensive Slow mode with counterfactual checks only near the decision boundary, concentrating computation on ambiguous and high-stakes cases.

We develop a framework clearly separating the underlying world, the data generation process and the resulting model representations to study these questions in a controlled setup. 5,075 city coordinates define the world and 7 geometric tasks generate the training data for autoregressive training. We find that different tasks give rise to qualitatively and quantitatively distinct world representation geometries. However, multi-task training drives convergence of world representations: models trained on non-overlapping tasks develop aligned geometric representations, providing controlled evidence for the Multitask Scaling Hypothesis of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. To study adaptation, we pretrain models on all tasks, then test whether new entities (cities) can be consistently integrated into the representation space via fine-tuning. Surprisingly, we find that despite multi-task pretraining, some tasks, which we call divergent, actively harm the representational integration of new entities and harm generalization. Our results show that training on multiple relational tasks reliably produces convergent world representations, but lurking divergent tasks can catastrophically harm new entity integration via fine-tuning."}

In this paper, we propose a human-simulation-based framework that enables AI systems to autonomously form questions and set tasks by reasoning over their internal states, environmental observations, and interactions with other AI systems. The proposed method treats question formation as a first-class decision process preceding task selection and execution, and integrates internal-driven, environment-aware, and inter-agent-aware prompting scopes to progressively expand cognitive coverage. In addition, the framework supports learning the question-formation process from experience, allowing the system to improve its adaptability and decision quality over time. xperimental results in a multi-agent simulation environment show that environment-aware prompting significantly reduces no-eat events compared with the internal-driven baseline, and inter-agent-aware prompting further reduces cumulative no-eat events by more than 60% over a 20-day simulation, with statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05)."}

We introduce Collaborative Thoughts, a unified collaborative framework that enables autoregressive and diffusion models to reason and generate jointly through a closed-loop interaction. In Collaborative Thoughts, autoregressive models perform structured planning and constraint management, diffusion models instantiate these constraints as intermediate visual thoughts, and a vision-based critic module evaluates whether the visual thoughts satisfy the intended structural and physical requirements. This feedback is then used to iteratively refine subsequent planning and generation steps, mitigating error propagation across modalities. Importantly, Collaborative Thoughts uses the same collaborative loop regardless of whether the task is autoregressive question answering or diffusion-based visual generation. Through representative examples, we illustrate how Collaborative Thoughts can improve the reliability of spatial reasoning and the controllability of generation."}

We propose ToPT, a two-stage framework that delivers spatially consistent fusion and explicit task alignment.

Prior work has attributed the well-documented ``bulk-and-spike'' spectral structure, where a few dominant eigenvalues are separated from a bulk of smaller ones, to the imbalance in the data covariance matrix. In this work, we challenge this view by demonstrating that such spectral Bifurcation can arise purely from the network architecture, independent of data imbalance.\n  Specifically, we analyze a deep linear network setup and prove that, even when the data covariance is perfectly balanced, the Hessian still exhibits a Bifurcation eigenvalue structure: a dominant cluster and a bulk cluster. Crucially, we establish that the ratio between dominant and bulk eigenvalues scales linearly with the network depth. This reveals that the spectral gap is strongly affected by the network architecture rather than solely by data distribution. Our results suggest that both model architecture and data characteristics should be considered when designing optimization algorithms for deep networks."}

Here we develop instrumental goal trajectories to expand these options beyond the model. Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds.

Conventional CIL approaches implicitly assume that classes are morphologically static, focusing primarily on preserving previously learned representations as new classes are introduced. However, this assumption neglects intra-class evolution: a phenomenon wherein instances of the same semantic class undergo significant morphological transformations, such as a larva turning into a butterfly. Consequently, a model must both discriminate between classes and adapt to evolving appearances within a single class. To systematically address this challenge, we formalize Stage-Aware CIL (Stage-CIL), a paradigm in which each class is learned progressively through distinct morphological stages. To facilitate rigorous evaluation within this paradigm, we introduce the Stage-Bench, a 10-domain, 2-stages dataset and protocol that jointly measure inter- and intra-class forgetting. We further propose STAGE, a novel method that explicitly learns abstract and transferable evolution patterns within a fixed-size memory pool. By decoupling semantic identity from transformation dynamics, STAGE enables accurate prediction of future morphologies based on earlier representations.

Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) seeks to mitigate this instability, but existing approaches face two persistent challenges. First, commonly used prompt strategies rely on static instructions that perform well on average but fail to adapt to heterogeneous queries. Second, more dynamic approaches depend on offline reward models that are fundamentally correlational, confounding prompt effectiveness with query characteristics. We propose Causal Prompt Optimization (CPO), a framework that reframes prompt design as a problem of causal estimation. CPO operates in two stages. First, it learns an offline causal reward model by applying Double Machine Learning (DML) to semantic embeddings of prompts and queries, isolating the causal effect of prompt variations from confounding query attributes. Second, it utilizes this unbiased reward signal to guide a resource-efficient search for query-specific prompts without relying on costly online evaluation. We evaluate CPO across benchmarks in mathematical reasoning, visualization, and data analytics. CPO consistently outperforms human-engineered prompts and state-of-the-art automated optimizers. The gains are driven primarily by improved robustness on hard queries, where existing methods tend to deteriorate. Beyond performance, CPO fundamentally reshapes the economics of prompt optimization: by shifting evaluation from real-time model execution to an offline causal model, it enables high-precision, per-query customization at a fraction of the inference cost required by online methods. Together, these results establish causal inference as a scalable foundation for reliable and cost-efficient prompt optimization in enterprise LLM deployments."}

Existing decoding methods, such as contrastive decoding (CD), rely on random perturbations to construct contrastive data for mitigating hallucination patterns. However, such a way is hard to control the visual cues that drive hallucination or well align with model weaknesses. We propose Model-aware Counterfactual Data based Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a new inference strategy that combines model-guided counterfactual construction with decoding. Our approach uses the Video-LLM's own feedback to identify object regions most responsible for hallucination, generating targeted counterfactual inputs at the object level rather than arbitrary frame or temporal modifications. These model-aware counterfactual data is then integrated into CD to enforce evidence-grounded token selection during decoding. Experiments on EventHallusion, MVBench, Perception-test and Video-MME show that MACD consistently reduces hallucination while maintaining or improving task accuracy across diverse Video-LLMs, including Qwen and InternVL families. The method is especially effective in challenging scenarios involving small, occluded, or co-occurring objects. Our code and data will be publicly released."}

We find that unlearning effectiveness degrades substantially on sparse models. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that this degradation occurs because existing unlearning methods require updating all parameters, yet sparsification prunes substantial weights to zero, fundamentally limiting the model's forgetting capacity. To address this challenge, we propose Sparsity-Aware Unlearning (SAU), which decouples unlearning from sparsification objectives through gradient masking that redirects updates to surviving weights, combined with importance-aware redistribution to compensate for pruned parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAU significantly outperforms existing methods on sparse LLMs, achieving effective forgetting while preserving model utility."}

ARA operates in two stages: first, a Hacker policy discovers reward model vulnerabilities while an Auditor learns to detect exploitation from latent representations; second, Auditor-Guided RLHF (AG-RLHF) gates reward signals to penalize detected hacking, transforming reward hacking from an unobservable failure into a measurable, controllable signal. Experiments across three hacking scenarios demonstrate that ARA achieves the best alignment-utility tradeoff among all baselines: reducing sycophancy to near-SFT levels while improving helpfulness, decreasing verbosity while achieving the highest ROUGE-L, and suppressing code gaming while improving Pass@1. Beyond single-domain evaluation, we show that reward hacking, detection, and mitigation all generalize across domains -- a Hacker trained on code gaming exhibits increased sycophancy despite no reward for this behavior, and an Auditor trained on one domain effectively suppresses exploitation in others, enabling efficient multi-domain defense with a single model."}

While existing work attempts to balance the trade-off between prediction accuracy and compute latency, we address this fundamental dilemma through architectural innovation.\n  We propose PRISM, which disaggregates the computation of each predictive step across different parameter sets, refactoring the computational pathways of draft models to successfully decouple model capacity from inference cost. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PRISM outperforms all existing draft architectures, achieving exceptional acceptance lengths while maintaining minimal draft latency for superior end-to-end speedup.

Patching techniques, commonly used and effective in time series modeling, help capture temporal dependencies by dividing the data into patches. However, existing patch-based methods fail to dynamically select patches and typically use all patches during the prediction process. In real-world time series, there are often low-quality issues during data collection, such as missing values, distribution shifts, anomalies and white noise, which may cause some patches to contain low-quality information, negatively impacting the prediction results. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust time series forecasting framework called SEER. Firstly, we propose an Augmented Embedding Module, which improves patch-wise representations using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and obtains series-wise token representations through a channel-adaptive perception mechanism. Secondly, we introduce a Learnable Patch Replacement Module, which enhances forecasting robustness and model accuracy through a two-stage process: 1) a dynamic filtering mechanism eliminates negative patch-wise tokens; 2) a replaced attention module substitutes the identified low-quality patches with global series-wise token, further refining their representations through a causal attention mechanism. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the SOTA performance of SEER."}

Although many models incorporate time through encodings or architectural design, they often compute attention over entangled node and edge representations, failing to reflect their distinct temporal behaviors. Node embeddings evolve slowly as they aggregate long-term structural context, while edge features reflect transient, timestamped interactions (e.g. messages, trades, or transactions). This mismatch results in semantic attention blurring, where attention weights cannot distinguish between slowly drifting node states and rapidly changing, information-rich edge interactions. As a result, models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and provide limited transparency into how temporal relevance is computed. This paper introduces KEAT (Kernelized Edge Attention for Temporal Graphs), a novel attention formulation that modulates edge features using a family of continuous-time kernels, including Laplacian, RBF, and learnable MLP variant. KEAT preserves the distinct roles of nodes and edges, and integrates seamlessly with both Transformer-style (e.g., DyGFormer) and message-passing (e.g., TGN) architectures. It achieves up to 18% MRR improvement over the recent DyGFormer and 7% over TGN on link prediction tasks, enabling more accurate, interpretable and temporally aware message passing in TGNNs."}

These algorithms work with very limited feedback in the form of pairwise preferences and fine-tune models to align with these preferences without explicitly learning a reward model. While the form of feedback used by these algorithms makes the data collection process easy and relatively more accurate, its ambiguity in terms of the quality of responses could have negative implications. For example, it is not clear if a decrease (increase) in the likelihood of preferred (dispreferred) responses during the execution of these algorithms could be interpreted as a positive or negative phenomenon. In this paper, we study how to design algorithms that can leverage additional information in the form of rating gap, which informs the learner how much the chosen response is better than the rejected one. We present new algorithms that can achieve faster statistical rates than DPO in presence of accurate rating gap information. Moreover, we theoretically prove and empirically show that the performance of our algorithms is robust to inaccuracy in rating gaps.

However, many existing systems rely on stochastic routing or ad-hoc heuristics, making their behavior difficult to reproduce and their decision process hard to interpret. We propose ORCH, a deterministic coordination framework for discrete-choice reasoning that orchestrates heterogeneous LLMs. ORCH follows a ``many analyses, one decision'' paradigm: multiple base models independently produce structured analyses, and a dedicated merge agent outputs the final choice. The framework uses fixed rules for task decomposition and answer aggregation, keeping the pipeline predictable, reproducible, and training-free. Determinism here refers to fixed routing and aggregation rules under a fixed evaluation protocol, rather than strict bit-level reproducibility across deployments. To exploit model complementarity, we optionally introduce an EMA-guided router that updates agent selection using historical accuracy, latency, or cost; since it relies on answer-based feedback, it is mainly intended for benchmarking, controlled evaluation, or delayed-feedback settings. Experiments on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GSM8K show that ORCH consistently outperforms single-model baselines and a majority-vote ensemble. On MMLU-Pro, ORCH improves accuracy by over 10 points compared to the strongest baseline, and on GSM8K it yields gains exceeding 50 points; McNemar tests confirm statistical significance. The EMA router provides an additional 0.7--2.0 point accuracy boost, and ablations show that both multi-agent collaboration and routing contribute substantially. Overall, ORCH offers a practical path toward controllable, interpretable, and deployment-ready LLM-based agent systems for discrete-choice reasoning."}

Crucially, the learning process relies on non-equilibrium adaptation through smoothed best responses to observed payoffs. We establish convergence to (approximate) equilibria in two-agent zero-sum and multi-agent identical-interest stochastic games over an infinite horizon.

As reasoning depth increases, sequential orchestration becomes brittle, context windows impose hard limits that degrade performance, and opaque execution traces make failures difficult to localize or debug.

ROMA decomposes goals into dependency-aware subtask trees that can be executed in parallel, while aggregation compresses and validates intermediate results to control context growth. Our framework standardizes agent construction around four modular roles --Atomizer (which decides whether a task should be decomposed), Planner, Executor, and Aggregator -- which cleanly separate orchestration from model selection and enable transparent, hierarchical execution traces. This design supports heterogeneous multi-agent systems that mix models and tools according to cost, latency, and capability. To adapt ROMA to specific tasks without fine-tuning, we further introduce GEPA$+$, an improved Genetic-Pareto prompt proposer that searches over prompts within ROMA's component hierarchy while preserving interface contracts. We show that ROMA, combined with GEPA+, delivers leading system-level performance on reasoning and long-form generation benchmarks. On SEAL-0, which evaluates reasoning over conflicting web evidence, ROMA instantiated with GLM-4.6 improves accuracy by 9.9\\% over Kimi-Researcher.

Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, we propose SOPRAG, a novel framework specifically designed to address the above pain points in SOP retrieval. SOPRAG replaces flat chunking with specialized Entity, Causal, and Flow graph experts to resolve industrial structural and logical complexities. To optimize and coordinate these experts, we propose a Procedure Card layer that prunes the search space to eliminate computational noise, and an LLM-Guided gating mechanism that dynamically weights these experts to align retrieval with operator intent. To address the scarcity of domain-specific data, we also introduce an automated, multi-agent workflow for benchmark construction. Extensive experiments across four industrial domains demonstrate that SOPRAG significantly outperforms strong lexical, dense, and graph-based RAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response utility, achieving perfect execution scores in real-world critical tasks."}

While limiting exploration to a feasible zone has become widely accepted as a way to ensure safety, key questions remain unresolved: what is the maximum feasible zone achievable through exploration, and how can it be identified? This paper, for the first time, answers these questions by revealing that the goal of safe exploration is to find the equilibrium between the feasible zone and the environment model. This conclusion is based on the understanding that these two components are interdependent: a larger feasible zone leads to a more accurate environment model, and a more accurate model, in turn, enables exploring a larger zone. We propose the first equilibrium-oriented safe exploration framework called safe equilibrium exploration (SEE), which alternates between finding the maximum feasible zone and the least uncertain model. Using a graph formulation of the uncertain model, we prove that the uncertain model obtained by SEE is monotonically refined, the feasible zones monotonically expand, and both converge to the equilibrium of safe exploration. Experiments on classic control tasks show that our algorithm successfully expands the feasible zones with zero constraint violation, and achieves the equilibrium of safe exploration within a few iterations."}

To bridge this gap, we propose ProcMEM, a framework that enables agents to autonomously learn procedural memory from interaction experiences without parameter updates. By formalizing a Skill-MDP, ProcMEM transforms passive episodic narratives into executable Skills defined by activation, execution, and termination conditions to ensure executability. To achieve reliable reusability without capability degradation, we introduce Non-Parametric PPO, which leverages semantic gradients for high-quality candidate generation and a PPO Gate for robust Skill verification. Through score-based maintenance, ProcMEM sustains compact, high-quality procedural memory. Experimental results across in-domain, cross-task, and cross-agent scenarios demonstrate that ProcMEM achieves superior reuse rates and significant performance gains with extreme memory compression. Visualized evolutionary trajectories and Skill distributions further reveal how ProcMEM transparently accumulates, refines, and reuses procedural knowledge to facilitate long-term autonomy."}

Based on it, we develop an upper confidence bound (UCB) acquisition function to select the queried points. Furthermore, we introduce a more complex and practical problem setting, named combinatorial bandit Bayesian optimization (CBBO), where only a subset of the outputs can be selected to contribute to the objective function. To tackle this, we propose a tensor-output CBBO method, which extends TOGP to handle partially observed outputs, and accordingly design a novel combinatorial multi-arm bandit-UCB2 (CMAB-UCB2) criterion to sequentially select both the queried points and the optimal output subset. Theoretical regret bounds for the two methods are established, ensuring their sublinear performance. Extensive synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate their superiority."}

In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between response entropy and accuracy, indicating that entropy can serve as a reliable and unsupervised proxy for annotation noise and sample difficulty. Based on this insight, we propose a novel Entropy-Guided Training (EGT) approach for multimodal reasoning reward models, which combines two strategies: (1) entropy-guided data curation to mitigate the impact of unreliable samples, and (2) an entropy-guided training strategy that progressively introduces more complex examples. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks show that the EGT-trained model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal reward models."}

However, conventional FL algorithms often suffer from performance disparities across clients caused by heterogeneous data distributions and unequal participation, which leads to unfair outcomes. Specifically, we focus on two core fairness challenges, i.e., representation bias, arising from misaligned client representations, and collaborative bias, stemming from inequitable contribution during aggregation, both of which degrade model performance and generalizability. To mitigate these disparities, we propose CoRe-Fed, a unified optimization framework that bridges collaborative and representation fairness via embedding-level regularization and fairness-aware aggregation. Initially, an alignment-driven mechanism promotes semantic consistency between local and global embeddings to reduce representational divergence. Subsequently, a dynamic reward-penalty-based aggregation strategy adjusts each client's weight based on participation history and embedding alignment to ensure contribution-aware aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that CoRe-Fed improves both fairness and model performance over the state-of-the-art baseline algorithms."}

Without altering the mechanism, we view standard attention through a top-N selection lens and study its behaviour directly in value-state space. We define geometric metrics - Precision, Recall, and F-score - to quantify separability between selected and non-selected tokens, and derive non-asymptotic bounds with explicit dependence on dimension and margin under empirically motivated assumptions (stable value norms with a compressed sink token, exponential similarity decay, and piecewise attention weight profiles). The theory predicts a small-N operating regime of strongest non-trivial separability and clarifies how sequence length and sink similarity shape the metrics. Empirically, across LLaMA-2-7B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B, measurements closely track the theoretical envelopes: top-N selection sharpens separability, sink similarity correlates with Recall. We also found that in LLaMA-2-7B heads specialize into three regimes - Retriever, Mixer, Reset - with distinct geometric signatures. Overall, attention behaves as a structured geometric classifier with measurable criteria for token selection, offering head level interpretability and informing geometry-aware sparsification and design of attention in LLMs."}

To effectively capture this periodic heterogeneity, we propose PHAT (Period Heterogeneity-Aware Transformer). Specifically, PHAT arranges multivariate inputs into a three-dimensional \"periodic bucket\" tensor, where the dimensions correspond to variate group characteristics with similar periodicity, time steps aligned by phase, and offsets within the period. By restricting interactions within buckets and masking cross-bucket connections, PHAT effectively avoids interference from inconsistent periods. We also propose a positive-negative attention mechanism, which captures periodic dependencies from two perspectives: periodic alignment and periodic deviation. Additionally, the periodic alignment attention scores are decomposed into positive and negative components, with a modulation term encoding periodic priors. This modulation constrains the attention mechanism to more faithfully reflect the underlying periodic trends. A mathematical explanation is provided to support this property. We evaluate PHAT comprehensively on 14 real-world datasets against 18 baselines, and the results show that it significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving highly competitive forecasting performance.

Existing approaches, however, face critical limitations. Supervised models require impractical amounts of labeled data. Foundation models for activity recognition focus only on inertial sensors, failing to address the unique characteristics of smart-home binary sensor events: their sparse, discrete nature combined with rich semantic associations. LLM-based approaches, while tested in this domain, still raise several issues regarding the need for natural language descriptions or prompting, and reliance on either external services or expensive hardware, making them infeasible in real-life scenarios due to privacy and cost concerns. We introduce DomusFM, the first foundation model specifically designed and pretrained for smart-home sensor data. DomusFM employs a self-supervised dual contrastive learning paradigm to capture both token-level semantic attributes and sequence-level temporal dependencies. By integrating semantic embeddings from a lightweight language model and specialized encoders for temporal patterns and binary states, DomusFM learns generalizable representations that transfer across environments and tasks related to activity and event analysis. Through leave-one-dataset-out evaluation across seven public smart-home datasets, we demonstrate that DomusFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on different downstream tasks, achieving superior performance even with only 5% of labeled training data available for fine-tuning. Our approach addresses data scarcity while maintaining practical deployability for real-world smart-home systems."}

However, this paradigm suffers from two critical challenges: Structural Degeneration, where hierarchical and semantic representations are entangled, and Optimization Instability, which arises from oscillatory dynamics of minimax adversarial training. To tackle these issues, we propose DisRFM, a geometry-aware GDA framework that unifies Riemannian embedding and flow-based transport. First, to overcome structural degeneration, we embed graphs into a Riemannian manifold. By adopting polar coordinates, we explicitly disentangle structure (radius) from semantics (angle). Then, we enforce topology preservation through radial Wasserstein alignment and semantic discrimination via angular clustering, thereby preventing feature entanglement and collapse. Second, we address the instability of adversarial alignment by using Riemannian flow matching. This method learns a smooth vector field to guide source features toward the target along geodesic paths, guaranteeing stable convergence. The geometric constraints further guide the flow to maintain the disentangled structure during transport. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic stability of the flow matching and derive a tighter bound for the target risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisRFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

In this work, we compare LLM and FCA to better understand their strengths and weakneses in the topic modeling field. FCA is evaluated through the CREA pipeline used in past experiments on topic modeling and visualization, whereas GPT-5 is used for the LLM. A strategy based on three prompts is applied with GPT-5 in a zero-shot setup: topic generation from document batches, merging of batch results into final topics, and topic labeling. A first experiment reuses the teaching materials previously used to evaluate CREA, while a second experiment analyzes 40 research articles in information systems to compare the extracted topics with the underling subfields."}

It also presents the complete workflow, including data preprocessing and comparison of ML models. To understand which ML classification model works best for this kind of problem, we train and test the following three commonly used models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). The performance of each is evaluated with respect to accuracy and F1-score. The results indicate that ML models can be effectively utilized for three-way emotion classification of EEG signals. Among the three ML models trained on the available dataset, the RF model gave the best results. Its higher accuracy and F1-score suggest that it is able to capture the emotional patterns more accurately and effectively than the other two models. The RF model also outperformed the existing state-of-the-art classification models in terms of the accuracy parameter."}

This study introduces Generalizable Predictive Prompt Selection (GPS), which performs Bayesian inference towards prompt difficulty using a lightweight generative model trained on the shared optimization history. Intermediate-difficulty prioritization and history-anchored diversity are incorporated into the batch acquisition principle to select informative prompt batches.

Furthermore, the lack of self-optimization mechanisms means that erroneous tool outputs can mislead the LLM's responses. Additionally, the construction of existing tools entails significant manual effort, which consequently constrains their applicability. Recognizing that the reasoning traces of LLMs encapsulate implicit problem-solving capabilities, we propose UCT, a novel training-free framework that transforms agents from tool users to tool creators. This approach harvests reasoning experiences and distills them into reusable assets. This method transforms the agent from a mere tool user into a tool creator, enabling adaptive tool creation and self-updating during the inference process. We also introduce a memory consolidation mechanism to maintain the tool library, ensuring high reusability of retained experiential memory for subsequent reasoning tasks. This novel automated tool construction paradigm continuously improves tool quality during reasoning, allowing the overall agent system to progress without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a novel paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of TIR models.

Based on this formulation, we introduce synthetic tasks that evaluate the emergence of analogical reasoning under controlled settings. We find that the emergence of analogical reasoning is highly sensitive to data characteristics, optimization choices, and model scale. Through mechanistic analysis, we show that analogical reasoning in Transformers decomposes into two key components: (1) geometric alignment of relational structure in the embedding space, and (2) the application of a functor within the Transformer. These mechanisms enable models to transfer relational structure from one category to another, realizing analogy. Finally, we quantify these effects and find that the same trends are observed in pretrained LLMs. In doing so, we move analogy from an abstract cognitive notion to a concrete, mechanistically grounded phenomenon in modern neural networks."}

However, the application of forecasting solutions is often hindered by privacy constrains and regulations as the users participating in the Local Energy Community can be (rightfully) reluctant sharing their consumption patterns with others.

Existing mitigation approaches primarily rely on either external post-hoc verification or mapping uncertainty directly to abstention during fine-tuning, often resulting in overly conservative behavior.

VeriFY augments training with structured verification traces that guide the model to produce an initial answer, generate and answer a probing verification query, issue a consistency judgment, and then decide whether to answer or abstain. To address the risk of reinforcing hallucinated content when training on augmented traces, we introduce a stage-level loss masking approach that excludes hallucinated answer stages from the training objective while preserving supervision over verification behavior. Across multiple model families and scales, VeriFY reduces factual hallucination rates by 9.7 to 53.3 percent, with only modest reductions in recall (0.4 to 5.7 percent), and generalizes across datasets when trained on a single source.

Specifically, LocalV integrates hierarchical document partitioning, task planning, localized code generation, interface-consistent merging, and AST-guided locality-aware debugging. Experiments on RealBench, an IP-level Verilog generation benchmark, demonstrate that LocalV substantially outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and agents, achieving a pass rate of 45.0% compared to 21.6%."}

Existing safety alignment for LLMs is predominantly achieved through post-training methods, which are computationally expensive and often fail to generalize well across different models. A small number of lightweight alignment approaches either rely heavily on prior-computed safety injections or depend excessively on the model's own capabilities, resulting in limited generalization and degraded efficiency and usability during generation. In this work, we propose a safety-aware decoding method that requires only low-cost training of an expert model and employs a single neuron as a gating mechanism. By effectively balancing the model's intrinsic capabilities with external guidance, our approach simultaneously preserves utility and enhances output safety. It demonstrates clear advantages in training overhead and generalization across model scales, offering a new perspective on lightweight alignment for the safe and practical deployment of large language models.

We demonstrate that existing objectives fail to meet this criterion, as they enforce moment matching only for one or two predefined balancing functions, thus failing to achieve full distribution balance. To address this limitation, we propose direct forecasting with kernelized moment balancing (KMB-DF). Unlike existing objectives, KMB-DF adaptively selects the most informative balancing functions from a reproducing kernel hilbert space (RKHS) to enforce sufficient distribution balancing. We derive a tractable and differentiable objective that enables efficient estimation from empirical samples and seamless integration into gradient-based training pipelines.

Existing knowledge editing approaches emphasize atomic facts, improving factual recall but often failing to integrate new information into a coherent framework usable across contexts. In this work, we argue that knowledge internalization is fundamentally a reasoning problem rather than a memorization problem. Consequently, a model should be trained in situations where the new information is instrumental to solving a task, combined with pre-existing knowledge, and exercised through multi-step reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose a training strategy based on three principles. First, new knowledge is introduced as a coherent background story that contextualizes novel facts and explains their relation to existing knowledge. Second, models are trained using self-generated multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning involving the new information. Third, training is done using knowledge distillation, forcing a student model to internalize the teacher's reasoning behavior without access to the novel information. Experiments show that models trained with this strategy effectively leverage newly acquired knowledge during reasoning and achieve remarkable performance on challenging questions that require combining multiple new facts."}

CIR encodes the semantics of operational rules through constraint archetypes and candidate modeling paradigms, thereby decoupling rule logic from its mathematical instantiation. Upon a newly generated CIR knowledge base, we develop the rule-to-constraint (R2C) framework, a multi-agent pipeline that parses problem texts, synthesizes CIR implementations by retrieving domain knowledge, and instantiates optimization models. To systematically evaluate rule-to-constraint reasoning, we test R2C on our newly constructed benchmark featuring rich operational rules, and benchmarks from prior work. Extensive experiments show that R2C achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the proposed benchmark (47.2% Accuracy Rate). On established benchmarks from the literature, R2C delivers highly competitive results, approaching the performance of proprietary models (e.g., GPT-5). Moreover, with a reflection mechanism, R2C achieves further gains and sets new best-reported results on some benchmarks."}

Most existing approaches treat continual learning as avoiding interference with past updates, rather than considering what properties make the current task-specific update naturally preserve previously acquired knowledge. From a knowledge-decomposition perspective, we observe that low-rank adaptations exhibit highly imbalanced singular value spectra: a few dominant components absorb most of the adaptation energy, thereby (i) more likely to disrupt previously acquired knowledge and (ii) making the update more vulnerable to interference from subsequent tasks. To enable explicit balance among components, we decouple the magnitude of the task update from its directional structure and formulate it as a constrained optimization problem on a restricted Stiefel manifold. We address this problem using a projected first-order method compatible with standard deep-learning optimizers used in vision-language models. Our method mitigates both backward and forward forgetting, consistently outperforming continual learning baselines. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/haodotgu/EBLoRA."}

We introduce a multi-agent system formalized as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a directed acyclic structure. Each agent corresponds to a specific role or decision stage (e.g., content, business, or legal review in a compliance workflow), with predefined transitions representing task escalation or completion. Epistemic uncertainty is quantified at the agent level using Monte Carlo estimation, while system-level uncertainty is captured by the MDP's termination in either an automated labeled state or a human-review state. We illustrate the approach through a case study in AI safety evaluation for self-harm detection, implemented as a multi-agent compliance system. Results demonstrate improvements over a single-agent baseline, including up to a 19\\% increase in accuracy, up to an 85x reduction in required human review, and, in some configurations, reduced processing time."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce prompt multiplicity, a framework for quantifying consistency in LLM evaluations. Our analysis reveals significant multiplicity (over 50% inconsistency in benchmarks like Med-HALT), suggesting that hallucination-related harms have been severely misunderstood. Furthermore, we study the role of consistency in hallucination detection and mitigation. We find that: (a) detection techniques detect consistency, not correctness, and (b) mitigation techniques like RAG, while beneficial, can introduce additional inconsistencies. By integrating prompt multiplicity into hallucination evaluation, we provide an improved framework of potential harms and uncover critical limitations in current detection and mitigation strategies."}

Building on this finding, we propose using entropy reduction as a supervisory signal and design two reward strategies to address the differing needs of optimizing tool-use behavior. Sparse outcome rewards provide coarse, trajectory-level guidance to improve efficiency, while dense process rewards offer fine-grained supervision to enhance performance. Experiments across diverse domains show that both reward designs improve tool-use behavior: the former reduces tool calls by 72.07% compared to the average of baselines, while the latter improves performance by 22.27%.

We investigate a mechanistic approach to preventing emergent misalignment by identifying a small set of internal features that reliably control the misaligned behavior and then discouraging the model from strengthening these features during fine-tuning. Across six fine-tuning domains, blocking (i.e., constraining) a fixed set of features achieves up to 95\\% relative reduction in emergent misalignment with no degradation in model quality or target-task performance. We strengthen validity with disjoint selection/evaluation splits, multiple independent judges, multiple random seeds for key settings, quality metrics, and extensive ablations demonstrating that the reduction in misalignment is specific to the identified mechanism. We also characterize a limiting regime in which misalignment re-emerges under prolonged fine-tuning, present evidence consistent with rerouting through alternative features or layers, and evaluate modifications that partially restore the misalignment-blocking effect. Overall, our results show that targeted training-time constraints on internal mechanisms can mitigate emergent misalignment without degrading target-task performance."}

Masked diffusion-based language models (MDMs) exhibit this failure in a much weaker form, but the underlying reason has remained unclear. A common explanation attributes this mitigation to the any-order training objective. However, observing \"[MASK] is $B$\" during training does not necessarily teach the model to handle the reverse prompt \"$B$ is [MASK]\". We show that the mitigation arises from architectural structure and its interaction with training. In a one-layer Transformer encoder, weight sharing couples the two directions by making forward and reverse attention scores positively correlated. In the same setting, we further show that the corresponding gradients are aligned, so minimizing the forward loss also reduces the reverse loss. Experiments on both controlled toy tasks and large-scale diffusion language models support these mechanisms, explaining why MDMs partially overcome a failure mode that persists in strong ARMs."}

Then, we propose the Model Provenance Set (MPS), which employs a sequential test-and-exclusion procedure to adaptively construct a small set satisfying the guarantee. The key idea of MPS is to test the significance of provenance existence within a candidate pool, thereby establishing a provable asymptotic guarantee at a user-specific confidence level.

Existing datasets used for safety alignment for an LRM are usually constructed by distilling safety reasoning traces and answers from an external LRM or human labeler. However, such reasoning traces and answers exhibit a distributional gap with the target LRM that needs alignment, and we conjecture such distributional gap is the culprit leading to significant degradation of reasoning ability of the target LRM. Driven by this hypothesis, we propose a safety alignment dataset construction method, dubbed DGR. DGR transforms and refines an existing out-of-distributional safety reasoning dataset to be aligned with the target's LLM inner distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that i) DGR effectively mitigates the safety tax while maintaining safety performance across all baselines, i.e., achieving \\textbf{+30.2\\%} on DirectRefusal and \\textbf{+21.2\\%} on R1-ACT improvement in average reasoning accuracy compared to Vanilla SFT; ii) the degree of reasoning degradation correlates with the extent of distribution shift, suggesting that bridging this gap is central to preserving capabilities. Furthermore, we find that safety alignment in LRMs may primarily function as a mechanism to activate latent knowledge, as a mere \\textbf{10} samples are sufficient for activating effective refusal behaviors. These findings not only emphasize the importance of distributional consistency but also provide insights into the activation mechanism of safety in reasoning models."}

Their environmental performance directly affects regional ecological security and is closely tied to national resource strategies and green transformation outcomes. Ensuring the authenticity and reliability of their environmental disclosure is thus a core and urgent issue for sustainable development and national strategic objectives.From a corporate governance perspective, this study examines equity balance as a fundamental governance mechanism, investigating its inhibitory effect on greenwashing behavior among these enterprises and the underlying pathways involved. Methodologically, the paper innovatively employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a Double Machine Learning (DML) model to construct counterfactual scenarios, mitigating endogeneity concerns and precisely identifying the causal relationship between equity balance and greenwashing. The findings indicate, first, a significant negative causal relationship between equity balance and corporate greenwashing, confirming its substantive governance effect. Second, this inhibitory effect exhibits notable heterogeneity, manifesting more strongly in western regions, upstream segments of the industrial chain, and industries with high environmental sensitivity. Third, the governance effect demonstrates clear temporal dynamics, with the strongest impact occurring in the current period, followed by a diminishing yet statistically significant lagged effect, and ultimately a stable long-term cumulative influence. Finally, mechanism analysis reveals that equity balance operates through three distinct channels to curb greenwashing: alleviating management performance pressure, enhancing the stability of the executive team, and intensifying media scrutiny."}

Nevertheless, significant heterogeneity persists across regions, industries and individual enterprises regarding energy structure, production scale, policy intensity and governance efficacy, resulting in pronounced distribution shifts and non-stationarity in carbon emission data across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Such cross-regional and cross-enterprise data drift not only compromises the accuracy of carbon emission reporting but substantially undermines the guidance value of predictive models for production planning and carbon quota trading decisions. To address this critical challenge, we integrate causal inference perspectives with stable learning methodologies and time-series modelling, proposing a stable temporal prediction mechanism tailored to distribution shift environments. This mechanism incorporates enterprise-level energy inputs, capital investment, labour deployment, carbon pricing, governmental interventions and policy implementation intensity, constructing a risk consistency-constrained stable learning framework that extracts causal stable features (robust against external perturbations yet demonstrating long-term stable effects on carbon dioxide emissions) from multi-environment samples across diverse policies, regions and industrial sectors. Furthermore, through adaptive normalization and sample reweighting strategies, the approach dynamically rectifies temporal non-stationarity induced by economic fluctuations and policy transitions, ultimately enhancing model generalization capability and explainability in complex environments."}

We provide an efficient tabular learning algorithm for this novel objective, proving it achieves fast finite-sample convergence: it achieves minimax optimal constant regret for $K=1$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\max((K-1),C_{K-1})\\sqrt{SAT\\log(T)})$ regret for any $K \\geq 2$. We numerically evaluate the performance of our algorithm under the objective of maximizing reward. Our implementation adaptively increases K over time, balancing lookahead depth against estimation variance. Empirical results demonstrate superior cumulative rewards over state-of-the-art tabular RL methods across synthetic MDPs and RL environments: JumpRiverswim, FrozenLake and AnyTrading."}

We define this paradigm as Test-Time Improvement (TTI). However, the mechanisms under how and why TTI succeed or fail remain poorly understood, and existing evaluation metrics fail to capture their task optimization efficiency, behavior adaptation after erroneous actions, and the specific utility of working memory for task completion. To address these gaps, we propose Test-time Improvement Diagnostic Evaluation (TIDE), an agent-agnostic and environment-agnostic framework that decomposes TTI into three comprehensive and interconnected dimensions. The framework measures (1) the overall temporal dynamics of task completion and (2) identifies whether performance is primarily constrained by recursive looping behaviors or (3) by burdensome accumulated memory. Through extensive experiments across diverse agents and environments, TIDE highlights that improving agent performance requires more than scaling internal reasoning, calling for explicitly optimizing the interaction dynamics between the agent and the environment."}

Existing MFBO methods primarily capture associational dependencies between inputs, fidelities, and objectives, rather than causal mechanisms, and can perform poorly when lower-fidelity proxies are poorly aligned with the target fidelity. We propose RESCUE (REducing Sampling cost with Causal Understanding and Estimation), a multi-objective MFBO method that incorporates causal calculus to systematically address this challenge. RESCUE learns a structural causal model capturing causal relationships between inputs, fidelities, and objectives, and uses it to construct a probabilistic multi-fidelity (MF) surrogate that encodes intervention effects. Exploiting the causal structure, we introduce a causal hypervolume knowledge-gradient acquisition strategy to select input-fidelity pairs that balance expected multi-objective improvement and cost.

Classic explainable AI (XAI) methods can surface failures at a single checkpoint of a model, but they are structurally ill-suited to justify what changed internally across different checkpoints and which explanatory claims are warranted about that change. We take the position that behavioral shifts should be explained comparatively: the core target should be the intervention-induced shift between a reference model and an intervened model, rather than any single model in isolation. To this aim we formulate a Comparative XAI ($Δ$-XAI) framework with a set of desiderata to be taken into account when designing proper explaining methods.

Conversely, in the masked domain, prior methods typically assume the absence of deterministic trajectories, forcing a reliance on stochastic distillation. To bridge this gap, we establish explicit Masked Diffusion Duality, proving that the masked process arises as the projection of a continuous Gaussian process via a novel maximum-value index preservation mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce Masked Consistency Distillation (MCD), a principled framework that leverages this duality to analytically construct the deterministic coupled trajectories required for consistency distillation, bypassing numerical ODE solvers. This result strictly improves upon prior stochastic distillation methods, achieving a 16$\\times$ inference speedup without compromising generation quality.

Consequently, current methods struggle to precisely localize complex reasoning mechanisms or capture sequential influence from model internal workings to the reasoning outputs. In this paper, built on outcome-oriented and sequential-influence-aware principles, we focus on identifying components that have sequential contribution to reasoning behavior where outcomes are cumulated by long-range effects. We propose Integrated Policy Gradient (IPG), a novel framework that attributes reasoning behaviors to model's inner components by propagating compound outcome-based signals such as post reasoning accuracy backward through model inference trajectories.

In this work, we investigate the impact of FLS on generalization in deep networks under such practical conditions. Through empirical studies, we first uncover the emergence of an $\\textit{optimal FLS}$ -- neither too small nor too large -- that yields substantial generalization gains.

Motivated by how the human brain monitors errors at discrete decision points and resamples alternatives, we introduce Iterative Correction Sampling of Thoughts (Thought-ICS), a self-correction framework. Thought-ICS iteratively prompts the model to generate reasoning one discrete and complete thought at a time--where each thought represents a deliberate decision by the model--creating natural boundaries for precise error localization. Upon verification, the model localizes the first erroneous step, and the system backtracks to generate alternative reasoning from the last correct point.

Our proposed framework contains two crucial components: (1) It constructs a hierarchical graph representation comprising a collection of fine-grained subgraphs, each corresponding to a secondary structure motif (e.g., $α$-helices, $β$-strands, loops), and a single coarse-grained graph that connects these motifs based on their spatial arrangement and relative orientation. (2) It employs two GNNs for feature learning: the first operates within individual secondary motifs to capture local interactions, and the second models higher-level structural relationships across motifs. Our modular framework allows a flexible choice of GNN in each stage.

However, CFM is insufficient to ensure accuracy in learning probability paths. In this paper, we introduce a new partial differential equation characterization for the error between the learned and exact probability paths, along with its solution. We show that the total variation gap between the two probability paths is bounded above by a combination of the CFM loss and an associated divergence loss. This theoretical insight leads to the design of a new objective function that simultaneously matches the flow and its divergence. Our new approach improves the performance of the flow-based generative model by a noticeable margin without sacrificing generation efficiency.

To evaluate and probe this capability, we develop MentisOculi, a procedural, stratified suite of multi-step reasoning problems amenable to visual solution, tuned to challenge frontier models. Evaluating visual strategies ranging from latent tokens to explicit generated imagery, we find they generally fail to improve performance. Analysis of UMMs specifically exposes a critical limitation: While they possess the textual reasoning capacity to solve a task and can sometimes generate correct visuals, they suffer from compounding generation errors and fail to leverage even ground-truth visualizations. Our findings suggest that despite their inherent appeal, visual thoughts do not yet benefit model reasoning. MentisOculi establishes the necessary foundation to analyze and close this gap across diverse model families."}

However, their integration with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures is constrained by an expert explosion: as the number of tokens generated in parallel increases, the number of distinct experts activated grows nearly linearly. This results in substantial memory traffic that pushes inference into a memory-bound regime, negating the efficiency gains of both MoE and parallel decoding. To address this challenge, we propose Dynamic Expert Sharing (DES), a novel technique that shifts MoE optimization from token-centric pruning and conventional expert skipping methods to sequence-level coreset selection. To maximize expert reuse, DES identifies a compact, high-utility set of experts to satisfy the requirements of an entire parallel decoding block. We introduce two innovative selection strategies: (1) Intra-Sequence Sharing (DES-Seq), which adapts optimal allocation to the sequence level, and (2) Saliency-Aware Voting (DES-Vote), a novel mechanism that allows tokens to collectively elect a coreset based on aggregated router weights. Extensive experiments on MoE dLLMs demonstrate that DES reduces unique expert activations by over 55% and latency by up to 38%, while retaining 99% of vanilla accuracy, effectively decoupling memory overhead from the degree of parallelism."}

Extensive prior research suggests that this failure is an inherent, fundamental limit of autoregressive causal LLMs, indicating that these models tend to memorize factual-level knowledge rather than capture higher-level rules. In this paper, we challenge this view by showing that this seemingly fundamental limit can be mitigated by slightly tweaking the training data with a simple regularization data recipe called the Identity Bridge of the form \"$A \\to A$\" (e.g., The name of Alice is Alice). Theoretically, we prove that under this recipe, even a one-layer transformer can break the reversal curse by analyzing the implicit bias of gradient descent. Empirically, we show that a 1B pretrained language model finetuned with the proposed data recipe achieves a 40% success rate on reversal tasks, in stark contrast to a near-zero success rate when trained solely on forward-knowledge data. Our work provides a novel theoretical foundation for the reversal curse and offers a principled, low-cost path to encouraging LLMs to learn higher-level rules from data."}

In this work, we propose a method to enhance generalization at test time, i.e., without modifying pretrained weights. Building on DISCO, which provides a dictionary of neural operators trained across different dynamics, we introduce a neural operator splitting strategy that, at test time, searches over compositions of training operators to approximate unseen dynamics. On challenging out-of-distribution tasks including parameter extrapolation and novel combinations of physics phenomena, our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization results, while being able to recover the underlying PDE parameters.

To mitigate the human cost of failure attribution, we present AGENTRX, an automated domain-agnostic diagnostic framework that pinpoints the critical failure step in a failed agent trajectory. It synthesizes constraints, evaluates them step-by-step, and produces an auditable validation log of constraint violations with associated evidence; an LLM-based judge uses this log to localize the critical step and category.

This presumption prohibits their use under partial storage outage, imperfect communication, and stochastic access failures. Furthermore, we show that the original formulation collapses under such conditions. To address this gap, we introduce ProbDPP, a novel reliability-aware implementation of k-DPP that accounts for probabilistic data access by recasting the objective function with a regularization term that remains well-posed and decomposes into a geometric diversity term and unreliability cost. The resulting objective facilitates robust selection of diverse data batches under uncertainty.

To perform data analysis while maintaining patient privacy, we create ML models that satisfy Differential Privacy (DP).

We suggest improvements to address these open gaps. We account for inherent class imbalances and evaluate the utility-privacy trade-off more extensively and over stricter privacy budgets. Our evaluation is supported by empirically estimating practical privacy through black-box Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). The introduced DP should help limit leakage threats posed by MIAs, and our practical analysis is the first to test this hypothesis on the COVID-19 classification task. Our results indicate that needed privacy levels might differ based on the task-dependent practical threat from MIAs. The results further suggest that with increasing DP guarantees, empirical privacy leakage only improves marginally, and DP therefore appears to have a limited impact on practical MIA defense. Our findings identify possibilities for better utility-privacy trade-offs, and we believe that empirical attack-specific privacy estimation can play a vital role in tuning for practical privacy."}

The existing methods rely on establishing relations a priori, i.e. predefining graphs to capture inter-stock relationships. However, the stock-related web signals are characterised by high levels of noise, asynchrony, and challenging to obtain, resulting in poor generalisability and non-alignment between the predefined graphs and the downstream tasks. To address this, we propose GAPNet, a Graph Adaptation Plug-in Network that jointly learns task-specific topology and representations in an end-to-end manner. GAPNet attaches to existing pairwise graph or hypergraph backbone models, enabling the dynamic adaptation and rewiring of edge topologies via two complementary components: a Spatial Perception Layer that captures short-term co-movements across assets, and a Temporal Perception Layer that maintains long-term dependency under distribution shift. Across two real-world stock datasets, GAPNet has been shown to consistently enhance the profitability and stability in comparision to the state-of-the-art models, yielding annualised cumulative returns of up to 0.47 for RT-GCN and 0.63 for CI-STHPAN, with peak Sharpe Ratio of 2.20 and 2.12 respectively. The plug-and-play design of GAPNet ensures its broad applicability to diverse GNN-based architectures.

Our method not only protects patient information but also enhances data availability for research. To ensure its usefulness, we test synthetic data from multiple GANs and employ different data enhancement strategies on an actual stress detection task.

This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified \"closed world\" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination.

Most existing ECTS methods assume that the time-dependent decision costs governing the learning objective are known, fixed, and correctly specified. In practice, however, these costs are often uncertain and may change over time, leading to mismatches between training-time and deployment-time objectives. In this paper, we study ECTS under two practically relevant forms of cost non-stationarity: drift in the balance between misclassification and decision delay costs, and stochastic realizations of decision costs that deviate from the nominal training-time model. To address these challenges, we revisit representative ECTS approaches and adapt them to an online learning setting. Focusing on separable methods, we update only the triggering model during deployment, while keeping the classifier fixed.

However, the optimal operation of HMES remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-physics coupled dynamics of hydrogen energy storage systems (HESS) (consisting of electrolyters, fuel cells and hydrogen tanks) as well as the presence of multiple uncertainties from supply and demand. To address these challenges, this paper develops a comprehensive operational model for HMES that fully captures the nonlinear dynamics and multi-physics process of HESS. Moreover, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework by integrating the emerging representation learning techniques, enabling substantially accelerated and improved policy optimization for spatially and temporally coupled complex networked systems, which is not provided by conventional DRL. Experimental studies based on real-world datasets show that the comprehensive model is crucial to ensure the safe and reliable of HESS. In addition, the proposed SR-DRL approaches demonstrate superior convergence rate and performance over conventional DRL counterparts in terms of reducing the operation cost of HMES and handling the system operating constraints. Finally, we provide some insights into the role of representation learning in DRL, speculating that it can reorganize the original state space into a well-structured and cluster-aware geometric representation, thereby smoothing and facilitating the learning process of DRL."}

Recent efforts pursue this in different ways, such as RL fine-tuning to elicit long CoT or scaling latent reasoning through architectural recurrence. This makes reasoning length an important scaling knob. In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon (both theoretically and experimentally): under outcome-only supervision, out-of-distribution (OOD) performance can continue improving as training-time reasoning length (e.g., the token budget in RL, or the loop count in looped Transformers) increases, even after in-distribution (ID) performance has saturated. This suggests that robustness may require a larger budget than ID validation alone would indicate. We provide theoretical explanations via two mechanisms: (i) self-iteration can induce a stronger inductive bias in the hypothesis class, reshaping ID-optimal solutions in ways that improve OOD generalization; and (ii) when shortcut solutions that work for ID samples but not for OOD samples persist in the hypothesis class, regularization can reduce the learned solution's reliance on these shortcuts as the number of self-iterations increases. We complement the theory with empirical evidence from two realizations of scaling training-time reasoning length: increasing the number of loops in looped Transformers on a synthetic task, and increasing token budgets during RL fine-tuning of LLMs on mathematical reasoning."}

We prove that learning with K strategies yields a Theta(K log K) improvement in sample complexity over binary preferences, and that DPO converges to the entropy-regularized utility-maximizing policy. To exploit this signal, we propose a two-stage training pipeline: (i) strategy selection, which optimizes the model to choose the best strategy for a given problem via best-vs-all comparisons, and (ii) execution refinement, which trains the model to correctly execute the selected strategy using margin-stratified pairs. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, CU-DPO improves strategy selection accuracy from 35-46 percent to 68-78 percent across seven base models, yielding consistent downstream reasoning gains of up to 6.6 points on in-distribution datasets with effective transfer to out-of-distribution tasks."}

However, the high computational and energy overhead of on-device training hinders its deployment on battery-powered mobile systems with strict thermal and memory budgets. While prior research has extensively optimized model architectures for efficient inference, the training phase remains bottlenecked by the processing of massive, often redundant, local datasets. In this work, we propose a data-centric optimization framework that leverages dataset pruning to achieve resource-efficient edge learning. Unlike standard methods that process all available data, our approach constructs compact, highly informative training subsets via a lightweight, on-device importance evaluation. Specifically, we utilize average loss statistics derived from a truncated warm-up phase to rank sample importance, deterministically retaining only the most critical data points under a dynamic pruning ratio. This mechanism is model-agnostic and operates locally without inter-device communication. Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves a near-linear reduction in training latency and energy consumption proportional to the pruning ratio, with negligible degradation in model accuracy. These results validate dataset pruning as a vital, complementary paradigm for enhancing the sustainability and scalability of learning on resource-constrained mobile edge devices."}

By formulating structured weight learning under an augmented Lagrangian framework and introducing an adaptive controller that dynamically balances the training loss and structural constraints, SALAAD preserves the stability of standard training dynamics while enabling explicit control over the evolution of effective model capacity during training. Experiments across model scales show that SALAAD substantially reduces memory consumption during deployment while achieving performance comparable to ad-hoc methods.

Quantum Computing (QC), which exploits quantum mechanisms for computation, has attracted growing attention and significant global investment as it may address these challenges. Consequently, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the integration of these two fields, has received increasing interest, with a notable rise in related studies in recent years.

In practice, Thompson Sampling (TS) is often initialized with a uniform Beta(1,1) prior, implicitly assuming a 50% success rate for unseen items. When true base rates are far lower, this optimistic prior systematically over-allocates to weak items. The impact is amplified by batched policy updates and pipeline latency: for hours, newly launched items can remain effectively \"no data,\" so the prior dominates allocation before feedback is incorporated. We propose Dynamic Prior Thompson Sampling, a prior design that directly controls the probability that a new arm outcompetes the incumbent winner. Our key contribution is a closed-form quadratic solution for the prior mean that enforces P(X_j > Y_k) = epsilon at introduction time, making exploration intensity predictable and tunable while preserving TS Bayesian updates. Across Monte Carlo validation, offline batched simulations, and a large-scale online experiment on a thumbnail personalization system serving millions of users, dynamic priors deliver precise exploration control and improved efficiency versus a uniform-prior baseline."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce TextBFGS, a second-order framework to implement a Quasi-Newton optimization method for discrete text. Unlike traditional memory-based approaches that retrieve similar textual instances, TextBFGS approximates the inverse Hessian matrix by retrieving Gradient-Operators from the memory of pre-learned successful trajectories. Specifically, given a textual gradient feedback, TextBFGS identifies historical correction patterns from the optimization knowledge base and tries to apply these abstract operators to the current variable. This mechanism enables a One-Pass Update, combining feedback generation and second-order correction into a single inference step. Empirical evaluations on code optimization across diverse domains (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP) demonstrate that TextBFGS significantly outperforms first-order baselines. It achieves superior pass rates with fewer model calls and exhibits strong cross-task transferability, thus establishes a mathematically grounded paradigm for efficient, memory-aware text optimization."}

In this work, we investigate the robustness of common combinations of machine learning models and counterfactual generation algorithms in the presence of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world tabular datasets, we show that counterfactual explanations are highly sensitive to model uncertainty.

The flue gas differential pressure across the air preheater unit installed in a 660 MW thermal power plant is analyzed as a case study since it mimics the batch processes due to load cycling in the power plant.

Existing graph contrastive learning methods typically rely on either random perturbations (e.g., edge dropping) to generate diverse views or purely spectral augmentations (e.g., SVD) to preserve global structural priors. However, random perturbations are structure-agnostic and may remove critical edges, while SVD-based views often become dense and lack sufficient diversity. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGCL, a robust graph contrastive learning framework via SVD-guided structural perturbation. SPGCL couples lightweight stochastic edge removal with an SVD-guided refinement step that can recover mistakenly removed informative edges and introduce semantically meaningful missing links while avoiding graph densification through sparse top-ranked edge selection and merging. By balancing edge removal and recovery rates, SPGCL explicitly controls structural discrepancy between views so that contrastive signals reflect semantic structural differences rather than edge-count gaps. We further incorporate a contrastive fusion module regularized by a global similarity constraint to better align the two views. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPGCL consistently improves robustness and accuracy of base GNNs, outperforming state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning and structure learning methods."}

To resolve this tension, we introduce CARE-RFT (Confidence-Anchored Regularized Reinforcement Finetuning), a novel method that replaces standard reverse KL regularization with a skew reverse KL divergence. CARE-RFT provides a confidence-sensitive penalty: it is bounded for confident, consistently rewarded explorations to enable reasoning, while unbounded elsewhere to preserve calibration.

Still, most existing methods rely on Euclidean geometry to model intra-domain relationships. This approach can fail when features are only weakly related to the task of interest, leading to noisy, semantically misleading structure and degraded alignment quality. To address this limitation, we introduce FoSTA (Forest-guided Semantic Transport Alignment), a scalable alignment framework that leverages forest-induced geometry to denoise intra-domain structure and recover task-relevant manifolds prior to alignment. FoSTA builds semantic representations directly from label-informed forest affinities and aligns them via fast, hierarchical semantic transport, capturing meaningful cross-domain relationships. Extensive comparisons with established baselines demonstrate that FoSTA improves correspondence recovery and label transfer on synthetic benchmarks and delivers strong performance in practical single-cell applications, including batch correction and biological conservation."}

Submitted to ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology", "summary": "Large language models have achieved remarkable success in time series prediction tasks, but their substantial computational and memory requirements limit deployment on lightweight platforms. In this paper, we propose the Symbolic Transition Mechanism (STM) a novel framework that bridges numeric time series data and language models through symbolic abstraction and prompt engineering. STM transforms continuous time series values into symbol tokens with quantization techniques based on human cognitive structures, and captures temporal dynamics through structured transformations of symbols, enabling fast engineering based predictions in which language models focus on critical parts of time series data. STM is a general purpose mechanisms that ensure the integrity of backbone language models, but they significantly improve their efficiency by inferring the dynamic and structured patterns inherent in time series data. We evaluated STM on various time series datasets, paired with four small language models (SLM) with limited computational environments. For all models, STM achieves error reductions of up to 69% in MAE and 90% in MSE compared to the default backbone SLM without STM. These results demonstrate the potential of STM as an efficient, adaptable layer for symbol-driven time series prediction using foundation models. The accuracy improvements were made at negligible resource costs, with maximum GPU memory of the base model increasing by approximately 0.06% and latency overhead increasing by only 0.64%."}

This forces a difficult trade-off: use expressive but computationally demanding models like Deep Gaussian Processes, or scalable but limited methods like Random Fourier Features (RFF). We close this gap by introducing Random Wavelet Features (RWF), a framework that constructs scalable, non-stationary kernel approximations by sampling from wavelet families. By harnessing the inherent localization and multi-resolution structure of wavelets, RWF generates an explicit feature map that captures complex, input-dependent patterns. Our framework provides a principled way to generalize RFF to the non-stationary setting and comes with a comprehensive theoretical analysis, including positive definiteness, unbiasedness, and uniform convergence guarantees. We demonstrate empirically on a range of challenging synthetic and real-world datasets that RWF outperforms stationary random features and offers a compelling accuracy-efficiency trade-off against more complex models, unlocking scalable and expressive kernel methods for a broad class of real-world non-stationary problems."}

Using World Health Organization hemoglobin thresholds, we defined anemia status for children aged 6-59 months and formulated a binary classification task by grouping all anemia severities as \\emph{anemic} versus \\emph{not anemic}. We analyzed Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS 2022) microdata comprising 1,855 children and initially considered 48 candidate features spanning demographic, socioeconomic, maternal, and child health characteristics. To obtain a stable and substantiated feature set, we applied four features selection techniques (Chi-square, mutual information, point-biserial correlation, and Boruta) and prioritized features supported by multi-method consensus. Five features: child age, recent fever, household size, maternal anemia, and parasite deworming were consistently selected by all methods, while amenorrhea, ethnicity indicators, and provinces were frequently retained. We then compared eight traditional machine learning classifiers (LR, KNN, DT, RF, XGBoost, SVM, NB, LDA) with two deep learning models (DNN and TabNet) using standard evaluation metrics, emphasizing F1-score and recall due to class imbalance. Among all models, logistic regression attained the best recall (0.701) and the highest F1-score (0.649), while DNN achieved the highest accuracy (0.709), and SVM yielded the strongest discrimination with the highest AUC (0.736). Overall, the results indicate that both machine learning and deep learning models can provide competitive anemia prediction and the interpretable features such as child age, infection proxy, maternal anemia, and deworming history are central for risk stratification and public health screening in Nepal."}

Beyond analysis, probes are often used operationally in probe-then-steer pipelines: a learned concept vector is extracted from a probe and injected via additive activation steering by adding it to a layer representation during the forward pass. The effectiveness of this pipeline hinges on estimating concept vectors that are accurate, directionally stable under ablation, and inexpensive to obtain. Motivated by these desiderata, we propose RAPTOR (Ridge-Adaptive Logistic Probe), a simple L2-regularized logistic probe whose validation-tuned ridge strength yields concept vectors from normalized weights. Across extensive experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs and human-written concept datasets, RAPTOR matches or exceeds strong baselines in accuracy while achieving competitive directional stability and substantially lower training cost; these quantitative results are supported by qualitative downstream steering demonstrations. Finally, using the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem (CGMT), we provide a mechanistic characterization of ridge logistic regression in an idealized Gaussian teacher-student model in the high-dimensional few-shot regime, explaining how penalty strength mediates probe accuracy and concept-vector stability and yielding structural predictions that qualitatively align with trends observed on real LLM embeddings."}

We show that enforcing ODE consistency does not require expensive nonlinear integration: a token-wise locally linear ODE representation preserves physical fidelity while scaling to foundation-model regimes. Thus, we propose novel token representations that respect locally linear ODE evolution. Such linearity substantially accelerates integration while accurately approximating the local data manifold. Second, we introduce a simple yet effective inter-system attention that augments attention with a common structure hub (CSH) that stores shared tokens and aggregates knowledge across systems.

A Study of Synthetic Experiments", "comment": "25 pages, 23 figures", "summary": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning generated by large language models (LLMs) is often unfaithful: intermediate steps can be logically inconsistent or fail to reflect the causal relationship leading to the final answer. Despite extensive empirical observations, a fundamental understanding of CoT is lacking--what constitutes faithful CoT reasoning, and how unfaithfulness emerges from autoregressive training. We study these questions using well-controlled synthetic experiments, training small transformers on noisy data to solve modular arithmetic expressions step by step, a task we term Arithmetic Expression Reasoning. We find that models can learn faithful reasoning that causally follows the underlying arithmetic rules, but only when the training noise is below a critical threshold, a phenomenon attributable to simplicity bias. At higher noise levels, training dynamics exhibit a transition from faithful stepwise reasoning to unfaithful skip-step reasoning via an intermediate mixed mode characterized by a transient increase in prediction entropy. Mechanistic analysis reveals that models learn to encode internal uncertainty by resolving inconsistent reasoning steps, which suggests the emergence of implicit self-verification from autoregressive training."}

This formulation enables an efficient ranking of a large number of candidate block-removal configurations and yields many high-quality, non-trivial solutions beyond consecutive regions. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art block-removal methods across several benchmarks, with performance gains persisting after short retraining, and reaching improvements of up to 6 points on the MMLU benchmark. Our method requires only forward and backward passes for a few active parameters, together with an (at least approximate) Ising solver, and can be readily applied to any architecture.

However, this multimodal integration expands the attack surface by exposing the model to image-based jailbreaks crafted to induce harmful responses. Existing gradient-based jailbreak methods transfer poorly, as adversarial patterns overfit to a single white-box surrogate and fail to generalise to black-box models. In this work, we propose Universal and transferable jailbreak (UltraBreak), a framework that constrains adversarial patterns through transformations and regularisation in the vision space, while relaxing textual targets through semantic-based objectives. By defining its loss in the textual embedding space of the target LLM, UltraBreak discovers universal adversarial patterns that generalise across diverse jailbreak objectives. This combination of vision-level regularisation and semantically guided textual supervision mitigates surrogate overfitting and enables strong transferability across both models and attack targets. Extensive experiments show that UltraBreak consistently outperforms prior jailbreak methods. Further analysis reveals why earlier approaches fail to transfer, highlighting that smoothing the loss landscape via semantic objectives is crucial for enabling universal and transferable jailbreaks.

This design enables the local model to jointly learn task competence and collaboration behavior, allowing cloud requests to emerge naturally during post-training while respecting a prescribed assistance budget.

We argue that both effects reflect a shared geometric property of fine-tuning landscapes: they are low-dimensional in curvature. A small set of high-curvature dimensions dominates improvement, producing (i) heterogeneous time scales that yield rise-then-decay under fixed stochasticity, as captured by a minimal quadratic stochastic-ascent model, and (ii) degenerate improving updates, where many random perturbations share similar components along these directions. Using ES as a geometric probe on fine-tuning reward landscapes of GSM8K, ARC-C, and WinoGrande across Qwen2.5-Instruct models (0.5B--7B), we show that reward-improving perturbations remain empirically accessible with small populations across scales.

This severe data heterogeneity critically undermines the convergence stability, generalization ability, and ultimately the quality of service delivered by the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FLood, a novel FL framework inspired by out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. FLood dynamically counteracts the adverse effects of heterogeneity through a dual-weighting mechanism that jointly governs local training and global aggregation. At the client level, it adaptively reweights the supervised loss by upweighting pseudo-OOD samples, thereby encouraging more robust learning from distributionally misaligned or challenging data. At the server level, it refines model aggregation by weighting client contributions according to their OOD confidence scores, prioritizing updates from clients with higher in-distribution consistency and enhancing the global model's robustness and convergence stability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks under diverse non-IID settings demonstrate that FLood consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in both accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, FLood functions as an orthogonal plug-in module: it seamlessly integrates with existing FL algorithms to boost their performance under heterogeneity without modifying their core optimization logic.

We introduce GASP (Guided Adversarial Self-Play), a robustification method that explicitly trains detect-and-repair capabilities using only outcome verification. Without human labels or external teachers, GASP forms an adversarial self-play game within a single model: a polluter learns to induce failure via locally coherent corruptions, while an agent learns to diagnose and recover under the same corrupted conditioning. To address the scarcity of successful recoveries early in training, we propose in-distribution repair guidance, an imitation term on self-generated repairs that increases recovery probability while preserving previously acquired capabilities.

Ensemble methods are often adopted to mitigate these challenges by combining multiple detectors, which can reduce individual biases and increase robustness. Yet building an ensemble that is genuinely complementary remains challenging, since many detectors rely on similar decision cues and end up producing redundant anomaly scores. As a result, the potential of ensemble learning is often limited by the difficulty of identifying models that truly capture different types of irregularities. To address this, we propose a methodology for characterizing anomaly detectors through their decision mechanisms. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations, we quantify how each model attributes importance to input features, and we use these attribution profiles to measure similarity between detectors. We show that detectors with similar explanations tend to produce correlated anomaly scores and identify largely overlapping anomalies. Conversely, explanation divergence reliably indicates complementary detection behavior. Our results demonstrate that explanation-driven metrics offer a different criterion than raw outputs for selecting models in an ensemble. However, we also demonstrate that diversity alone is insufficient; high individual model performance remains a prerequisite for effective ensembles. By explicitly targeting explanation diversity while maintaining model quality, we are able to construct ensembles that are more diverse, more complementary, and ultimately more effective for unsupervised anomaly detection."}

Despite sharing base model weights, each agent independently builds and stores its own KV cache for the same long, tool-augmented trajectories, incurring substantial memory and compute overhead. Existing KV cache sharing methods largely overlook this multi-LoRA setting. We observe that, across agents, cache differences are dominated by adapter outputs, while activations from the shared pretrained backbone remain highly similar. Based on this observation, we propose LRAgent, a KV cache sharing framework for multi-LoRA agents that decomposes the cache into a shared base component from the pretrained weights and an adapter-dependent component from LoRA weights. LRAgent reduces memory overhead by sharing the base component and storing the adapter component in its inherent low-rank form, and further reduces compute overhead, enabled by shared-$A$ multi-LoRA architectures, by also sharing the low-rank cache and avoiding redundant computations for contexts already processed by other agents. To efficiently reconstruct adapter contributions at runtime, we introduce Flash-LoRA-Attention, a kernel that reorders attention computation to avoid materializing the low-rank cache to full dimension. LRAgent achieves throughput and time-to-first-token latency close to fully shared caching, while preserving accuracy near the non-shared caching baseline across agentic question-answering benchmarks."}

However, current sampling methods rely on simple confidence-based heuristics that ignore the long-term impact of local decisions, leading to trajectory lock-in where early hallucinations cascade into global incoherence. While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass. We formally derive the Token Influence Score (TIS) from a first-order expansion of the trajectory cost functional, proving that the gradient of future entropy with respect to input embeddings serves as an optimal control signal for minimizing uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce \\texttt{ActiveQueryAttention}, a sparse adjoint primitive that exploits the structure of the masking objective to reduce backward pass complexity. BoE achieves a superior Pareto frontier for inference-time scaling compared to existing unmasking methods, demonstrating that gradient-guided steering offers a mathematically principled and efficient path to robust non-autoregressive generation.

We attribute this to a mismatch typical in current SFT-RL pipelines: the distribution that generates the offline SFT data can differ substantially from the policy optimized during online RL, which learns from its own rollouts.\n  We propose PEAR (Policy Evaluation-inspired Algorithm for Offline Learning Loss Re-weighting), an SFT-stage method that corrects this mismatch and better prepares the model for RL. PEAR uses importance sampling to reweight the SFT loss, with three variants operating at the token, block, and sequence levels. It can be used to augment standard SFT objectives and incurs little additional training overhead once probabilities for the offline data are collected.\n  We conduct controlled experiments on verifiable reasoning games and mathematical reasoning tasks on Qwen 2.5 and 3 and DeepSeek-distilled models. PEAR consistently improves post-RL performance over canonical SFT, with pass at 8 gains up to a 14.6 percent on AIME2025.

Importantly, unlike other structured domains, weight-space learning targets maps operating on both weight and function spaces, making expressivity analysis particularly subtle. While a few prior works provide partial expressivity results, a comprehensive characterization is still missing. In this work, we address this gap by developing a systematic theory for expressivity of weight-space networks. We first prove that all prominent permutation-equivariant networks are equivalent in expressive power. We then establish universality in both weight- and function-space settings under mild, natural assumptions on the input weights, and characterize the edge-case regimes where universality no longer holds.

To help address this issue, we show that self-attention is efficiently computable to arbitrary precision with constant cost per token, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in memory use and computation. We derive our formulation by decomposing the conventional formulation's Taylor expansion into expressions over symmetric chains of tensor products. We exploit their symmetry to obtain feed-forward transformations that efficiently map queries and keys to coordinates in a minimal polynomial-kernel feature basis.

We implement our formulation and empirically validate its correctness. Our work enables unbounded token generation at modest fixed cost, substantially reducing the infrastructure and energy demands of large-scale Transformer models.

Scaling laws: Prediction error decomposes into irreducible aleatoric uncertainty and reducible epistemic error; the epistemic component follows a power law in dataset size, continuing to shrink even when total loss plateaus. Limits of learning: The aleatoric floor is exactly measurable, and architectures differ markedly in how they approach it: ResNets exhibit clean power-law scaling while Vision Transformers stall in low-data regimes. Soft labels: Oracle posteriors contain learnable structure beyond class labels: training with exact posteriors outperforms hard labels and yields near-perfect calibration.

We evaluate BOCLOAK across three social bot datasets, five state-of-the-art bot detectors, three adversarial defenses, and compare it against four leading graph adversarial attack baselines. BOCLOAK achieves up to 80.13% higher attack success rates while using 99.80% less GPU memory under realistic real-world constraints.

These directions can be linearly combined at inference to generate user-specified behaviors without additional optimization. Evaluated on the helpfulness-verbosity trade-off using the HelpSteer and UltraFeedback datasets, TS-DPO achieves broader Pareto-optimal coverage and smoother preference control than scalarized DPO.

Conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches often face challenges such as non-stationarity during training and limited generalization to unseen problem instances because they optimize representation learning and policy execution simultaneously. To address these issues, we introduce variational inference to the JSSP domain for the first time and derive a probabilistic objective based on the Evidence of Lower Bound (ELBO) with maximum entropy reinforcement learning. By mathematically decoupling representation learning from policy optimization, the VG2S framework enables the agent to learn robust structural representations of scheduling instances through a variational graph encoder. This approach significantly enhances training stability and robustness against hyperparameter variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior zero-shot generalization compared with state-of-the-art DRL baselines and traditional dispatching rules, particularly on large-scale and challenging benchmark instances such as DMU and SWV."}

Recent research has shown that ML models can benefit from morphological encoders for dirty categorical data, leading to significantly superior predictive performance. However the effects of using such encoders in AutoML methods are not known at the moment. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that transforms categorical data into numerical data so that an AutoML can handle categorical data transformed by more advanced encoding schemes. We benchmark the current robustness of AutoML methods on a set of dirty datasets and compare it with the proposed pipeline. This allows us to get insight on differences in predictive performance. We also look at the ML pipelines built by AutoMLs in order to gain insight beyond the best model as typically returned by these methods."}

In this paper, we introduce GRIT-VQ (Generalized Radius and Integrated Transform-Vector Quantization), a unified surrogate framework that keeps hard assignments in the forward pass while making VQ fully differentiable. GRIT-VQ replaces the straight-through estimator with a radius-based update that moves latents along the quantization direction with a controllable, geometry-aware step, and applies a data-agnostic integrated transform to the codebook so that all codes are updated through shared parameters instead of independently. Our theoretical analysis clarifies the fundamental optimization dynamics introduced by GRIT-VQ, establishing conditions for stable gradient flow, coordinated codebook evolution, and reliable avoidance of collapse across a broad family of quantizers. Across image reconstruction, image generation, and recommendation tokenization benchmarks, GRIT-VQ consistently improves reconstruction error, generative quality, and recommendation accuracy while substantially increasing codebook utilization compared to existing VQ variants."}

A key challenge of MU is how to reliably audit whether a model has truly forgotten specified training data. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely used for unlearning auditing, where samples that evade membership detection are often regarded as successfully forgotten. After carefully revisiting the reliability of MIA, we show that this assumption is flawed: failed membership inference does not imply true forgetting. We theoretically demonstrate that MIA-based auditing, when formulated as a binary classification problem, inevitably incurs statistical errors whose magnitude cannot be observed during the auditing process. This leads to overly optimistic evaluations of unlearning performance, while incurring substantial computational overhead due to shadow model training. To address these limitations, we propose Statistical Membership Inference Attack (SMIA), a novel training-free and highly effective auditing framework. SMIA directly compares the distributions of member and non-member data using statistical tests, eliminating the need for learned attack models. Moreover, SMIA outputs both a forgetting rate and a corresponding confidence interval, enabling quantified reliability of the auditing results. Extensive experiments show that SMIA provides more reliable auditing with significantly lower computational cost than existing MIA-based approaches. Notably, the theoretical guarantees and empirical effectiveness of SMIA suggest it as a new paradigm for reliable machine unlearning auditing."}

Standard PPO relies on surrogate objectives defined via importance ratios, which require evaluating policy likelihood that is typically straightforward when the policy is modeled as a Gaussian distribution. However, extending PPO to more expressive, high-capacity policy models such as continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), also known as flow-matching models, is challenging because likelihood evaluation along the full flow trajectory is computationally expensive and often numerically unstable. To resolve this issue, we propose PolicyFlow, a novel on-policy CNF-based reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates expressive CNF policies with PPO-style objectives without requiring likelihood evaluation along the full flow path. PolicyFlow approximates importance ratios using velocity field variations along a simple interpolation path, reducing computational overhead without compromising training stability. To further prevent mode collapse and further encourage diverse behaviors, we propose the Brownian Regularizer, an implicit policy entropy regularizer inspired by Brownian motion, which is conceptually elegant and computationally lightweight. Experiments on diverse tasks across various environments including MultiGoal, PointMaze, IsaacLab and MuJoCo Playground show that PolicyFlow achieves competitive or superior performance compared to PPO using Gaussian policies and flow-based baselines including FPO and DPPO.

While deep learning (DL) has been increasingly adopted in EPF to capture complex and nonlinear price dynamics, several important gaps persist: (i) limited attention to multi-day horizons beyond day-ahead forecasting, (ii) insufficient exploration of state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series DL models, and (iii) a predominant reliance on aggregated horizon-level evaluation that obscures time-of-day forecasting variation. To address these gaps, we propose a novel EPF framework that extends the forecast horizon to multi-day-ahead by systematically building forecasting models that leverage benchmarked SOTA time series DL models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation to analyse time-of-day forecasting performance by integrating model assessment at intraday interval levels across all five regions in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The results show that no single model consistently dominates across regions, metrics, and horizons. Overall, standard DL models deliver superior performance in most regions, while SOTA time series DL models demonstrate greater robustness to forecast horizon extension. Intraday interval-level evaluation reveals pronounced diurnal error patterns, indicating that absolute errors peak during the evening ramp, relative errors inflate during midday negative-price regimes, and directional accuracy degrades during periods of frequent trend changes. These findings suggest that future research on DL-based EPF can benefit from enriched feature representations and modelling strategies that enhance longer-term forecasting robustness while maintaining sensitivity to intraday volatility and structural price dynamics."}

The key to addressing this limitation is constructing the intermediate domains via samples directly. To this end, we propose an Entropy-regularized Semi-dual Unbalanced Optimal Transport (E-SUOT) framework to construct intermediate domains. Specifically, we reformulate flow-based GDA as a Lagrangian dual problem and derive an equivalent semi-dual objective that circumvents the need for likelihood estimation. However, the dual problem leads to an unstable min-max training procedure. To alleviate this issue, we further introduce entropy regularization to convert it into a more stable alternative optimization procedure. Based on this, we propose a novel GDA training framework and provide theoretical analysis in terms of stability and generalization.

We find that different tasks give rise to qualitatively and quantitatively distinct world representation geometries. However, multi-task training drives convergence of world representations: models trained on non-overlapping tasks develop aligned geometric representations, providing controlled evidence for the Multitask Scaling Hypothesis of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. To study adaptation, we pretrain models on all tasks, then test whether new entities (cities) can be consistently integrated into the representation space via fine-tuning. Surprisingly, we find that despite multi-task pretraining, some tasks, which we call divergent, actively harm the representational integration of new entities and harm generalization. Our results show that training on multiple relational tasks reliably produces convergent world representations, but lurking divergent tasks can catastrophically harm new entity integration via fine-tuning."}

To better understand these issues, we analyze DM-based TSDI process through a proximal-operator perspective and uncover that an implicit Wasserstein distance regularization inherent in the process hinders the model's ability to counteract non-stationarity and dissipative regularizer, thereby amplifying diversity at the expense of fidelity. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework called SPIRIT (Semi-Proximal Transport Regularized time-series Imputation). Specifically, we introduce entropy-induced Bregman divergence to relax the mass preserving constraint in the Wasserstein distance, formulate the semi-proximal transport (SPT) discrepancy, and theoretically prove the robustness of SPT against non-stationarity.

In this work, we theoretically analyze an in-context linear regression model with multi-head linear self-attention, and compare the training dynamics of two gradient based optimizers, namely gradient descent (GD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), the latter exhibiting superior generalization properties but is prohibitively expensive for training even medium-sized LLMs. We show, for the first time, that SAM induces a lower simplicity bias (SB)-the tendency of an optimizer to preferentially learn simpler features earlier in training-and identify this reduction as a key factor underlying its improved generalization performance. Motivated by this insight, we demonstrate that altering the training data distribution by upsampling or augmenting examples learned later in training similarly reduces SB and leads to improved generalization.

Their abilities to maintain internal memory and adapt quickly to unseen scenarios have offered them unparalleled performance when compared to non-recurrent counterparts. However, until today, the underlying mechanisms for their superior generalization and robustness performance remain poorly understood. In this study, by analyzing the hidden state domain of recurrent policies learned over a diverse set of training methods, model architectures, and tasks, we find that stable cyclic structures consistently emerge during interaction with the environment. Such cyclic structures share a remarkable similarity with \\textit{limit cycles} in dynamical system analysis, if we consider the policy and the environment as a joint hybrid dynamical system. Moreover, we uncover that the geometry of such limit cycles also has a structured correspondence with the policies' behaviors. These findings offer new perspectives to explain many nice properties of recurrent policies: the emergence of limit cycles stabilizes both the policies' internal memory and the task-relevant environmental states, while suppressing nuisance variability arising from environmental uncertainty; the geometry of limit cycles also encodes relational structures of behaviors, facilitating easier skill adaptation when facing non-stationary environments."}

For learning from such tabular data, we propose novel data transformation strategies that account for heterogeneous anonymization and evaluate them alongside standard imputation and LLM-based approaches. We employ multiple datasets, privacy configurations, and deployment scenarios, demonstrating that our method reliably regains utility. Our results show that generalized values are preferable to pure suppression, that the best data preparation strategy depends on the scenario, and that consistent data representations are crucial for maintaining downstream utility.

As the context extends, the expressive capacity of such an $N$-width MLP increases, but scaling its fast weights becomes prohibitively expensive for extremely long sequences. Recently, this fast-weight scaling perspective has motivated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention, which partitions the sequence into fast-weight experts and sparsely routes the tokens to them. In this paper, we elevate this perspective to a unifying framework for a wide range of efficient attention methods by interpreting them as scaling fast weights through routing and/or compression. Then we propose a compress-and-route strategy, which compresses the $N$-width MLP into a narrower one using a small set of landmark queries and constructs deformable experts by gathering top-$k$ activated key-value pairs for each landmark query. We call this strategy a Mixture of Top-$k$ Activations (MiTA), and refer to the resulting efficient mechanism as MiTA attention. Preliminary experiments on vision tasks demonstrate the promise of our MiTA attention and motivate further investigation on its optimization and broader applications in more challenging settings."}

A significant challenge for these communities is achieving self-sufficiency through effective management of the balance between energy production and consumption. To meet this challenge, it is essential to develop and implement forecasting models that deliver accurate predictions, which can then be utilized by optimization and planning algorithms. However, the application of forecasting solutions is often hindered by privacy constrains and regulations as the users participating in the Local Energy Community can be (rightfully) reluctant sharing their consumption patterns with others. In this context, the use of Federated Learning (FL) can be a viable solution as it allows to create a forecasting model without the need to share privacy sensitive information among the users. In this study, we demonstrate how FL and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks can be employed to achieve this objective, highlighting the trade-off between data sharing and forecasting accuracy."}

In this paper, we propose Lotus, a method that resolves this trade-off by simply modifying the projection process. We propose a criterion that quantifies the displacement of the unit gradient to enable efficient transitions between low-rank gradient subspaces. Experimental results indicate that Lotus is the most efficient method, achieving a 30% reduction in training time and a 40% decrease in memory consumption for gradient and optimizer states.

In this work, we use mechanistic interpretability to causally investigate the internal representations of a neural speech decoder. We perform cross-mode activation patching of internal activations across speech modes, and use tri-modal interpolation to examine whether speech representations vary discretely or continuously. We use coarse-to-fine causal tracing and causal scrubbing to find localized causal structure, allowing us to find internal subspaces that are sufficient for cross-mode transfer. In order to determine how finely distributed these effects are within layers, we perform neuron-level activation patching. We discover that small but not distributed subsets of neurons, rather than isolated units, affect the cross-mode transfer. Our results show that speech modes lie on a shared continuous causal manifold, and cross-mode transfer is mediated by compact, layer-specific subspaces rather than diffuse activity. Together, our findings give a causal explanation for how speech modality information is organized and used in brain-to-speech decoding models, revealing hierarchical and direction-dependent representational structure across speech modes."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce prompt multiplicity, a framework for quantifying consistency in LLM evaluations. Our analysis reveals significant multiplicity (over 50% inconsistency in benchmarks like Med-HALT), suggesting that hallucination-related harms have been severely misunderstood. Furthermore, we study the role of consistency in hallucination detection and mitigation. We find that: (a) detection techniques detect consistency, not correctness, and (b) mitigation techniques like RAG, while beneficial, can introduce additional inconsistencies.

Besides, vanilla KD imposes no structural constraint on the probability space. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective methodology, bilateral contrastive knowledge distillation (BicKD). This approach introduces a novel bilateral contrastive loss, which intensifies the orthogonality among different class generalization spaces while preserving consistency within the same class.

Across six fine-tuning domains, blocking (i.e., constraining) a fixed set of features achieves up to 95\\% relative reduction in emergent misalignment with no degradation in model quality or target-task performance. We strengthen validity with disjoint selection/evaluation splits, multiple independent judges, multiple random seeds for key settings, quality metrics, and extensive ablations demonstrating that the reduction in misalignment is specific to the identified mechanism. We also characterize a limiting regime in which misalignment re-emerges under prolonged fine-tuning, present evidence consistent with rerouting through alternative features or layers, and evaluate modifications that partially restore the misalignment-blocking effect.

An optimizer agent converts these templates into tractable optimization problems, analyzes trade-offs, and derives preferences across objectives. Lastly, a preference-driven controller agent, based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, leverages these preferences to operate near the Pareto frontier of network performance that best satisfies the original intent. Collectively, these agents enable networks to autonomously interpret, reason over, adapt to, and act upon diverse intents and network conditions in a scalable manner."}

While diffusion duality enables deterministic distillation for uniform models, these approaches generally underperform masked models and rely on complex integral operators. Conversely, in the masked domain, prior methods typically assume the absence of deterministic trajectories, forcing a reliance on stochastic distillation. To bridge this gap, we establish explicit Masked Diffusion Duality, proving that the masked process arises as the projection of a continuous Gaussian process via a novel maximum-value index preservation mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce Masked Consistency Distillation (MCD), a principled framework that leverages this duality to analytically construct the deterministic coupled trajectories required for consistency distillation, bypassing numerical ODE solvers. This result strictly improves upon prior stochastic distillation methods, achieving a 16$\\times$ inference speedup without compromising generation quality. Our findings not only provide a solid theoretical foundation connecting masked and continuous diffusion, but also unlock the full potential of consistency distillation for high-performance discrete generation.

We propose a method that improves BLLs by leveraging a projection of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) features onto the space spanned by the last-layer features. This enables posterior inference that accounts for variability of the full network while retaining the low computational cost of inference of a standard BLL. We show that our method yields posterior variances that are provably greater or equal to those of a standard BLL, correcting its tendency to underestimate epistemic uncertainty. To further reduce computational cost, we introduce a uniform subsampling scheme for estimating the projection matrix and for posterior inference. We derive approximation bounds for both types of sub-sampling. Empirical evaluations on UCI regression, contextual bandits, image classification, and out-of-distribution detection tasks in image and tabular datasets, demonstrate improved calibration and uncertainty estimates compared to standard BLLs and competitive baselines, while reducing computational cost."}

Rigorous isoFLOPs analysis further confirms that JTok-M fundamentally shifts the quality-compute Pareto frontier, achieving comparable model quality with 35% less compute relative to vanilla MoE architectures, and we validate that token-indexed parameters exhibit a predictable power-law scaling behavior. Moreover, our efficient implementation ensures that the overhead introduced by JTok and JTok-M remains marginal."}

Unfortunately, their practical deployment is limited by slow inference speed, high memory usage, and the computational demands of the noise estimation process. Post-training quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution to accelerate sampling and reduce memory overhead for diffusion models. Existing PTQ methods for diffusion models typically apply uniform weights to calibration samples across timesteps, which is sub-optimal since data at different timesteps may contribute differently to the diffusion process. Additionally, due to varying activation distributions and gradients across timesteps, a uniform quantization approach is sub-optimal. Each timestep requires a different gradient direction for optimal quantization, and treating them equally can lead to conflicting gradients that degrade performance. In this paper, we propose a novel PTQ method that addresses these challenges by assigning appropriate weights to calibration samples. Specifically, our approach learns to assign optimal weights to calibration samples to align the quantized model's gradients across timesteps, facilitating the quantization process. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, LSUN-Bedrooms, and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other PTQ methods for diffusion models."}

However, existing GNN-based methods often face challenges in learning multiscale representations and modeling long-range dependencies efficiently. In this work, we propose an efficient multiscale graph-based learning framework tailored to proteins. Our proposed framework contains two crucial components: (1) It constructs a hierarchical graph representation comprising a collection of fine-grained subgraphs, each corresponding to a secondary structure motif (e.g., $α$-helices, $β$-strands, loops), and a single coarse-grained graph that connects these motifs based on their spatial arrangement and relative orientation. (2) It employs two GNNs for feature learning: the first operates within individual secondary motifs to capture local interactions, and the second models higher-level structural relationships across motifs. Our modular framework allows a flexible choice of GNN in each stage. Theoretically, we show that our hierarchical framework preserves the desired maximal expressiveness, ensuring no loss of critical structural information. Empirically, we demonstrate that integrating baseline GNNs into our multiscale framework remarkably improves prediction accuracy and reduces computational cost across various benchmarks."}

To counter this, we propose Parametric Singularity Smoothing (PSS), a lightweight, flexible, and effective method for smoothing the singular spectra of weight matrices. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, architectures, and optimizers demonstrate that PSS mitigates instability, restores trainability even after failure, and improves both training efficiency and generalization."}

Across two real-world stock datasets, GAPNet has been shown to consistently enhance the profitability and stability in comparision to the state-of-the-art models, yielding annualised cumulative returns of up to 0.47 for RT-GCN and 0.63 for CI-STHPAN, with peak Sharpe Ratio of 2.20 and 2.12 respectively.

In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of the TRAK algorithm, characterizing its performance and quantifying the errors introduced by the approximations on which the method relies. We show that although the approximations incur significant errors, TRAK's estimated influence remains highly correlated with the original influence and therefore largely preserves the relative ranking of data points.

This forces SAEs to allocate monolithic features for compound concepts rather than decomposing them into interpretable constituents. We introduce PolySAE, which extends the SAE decoder with higher-order terms to model feature interactions while preserving the linear encoder essential for interpretability. Through low-rank tensor factorization on a shared projection subspace, PolySAE captures pairwise and triple feature interactions with small parameter overhead (3% on GPT2). Across four language models and three SAE variants, PolySAE achieves an average improvement of approximately 8% in probing F1 while maintaining comparable reconstruction error, and produces 2-10$\\times$ larger Wasserstein distances between class-conditional feature distributions.

However, the theoretical foundations for self-play finetuning remain underexplored. In this work, we tackle this by connecting self-play finetuning with adversarial imitation learning by formulating finetuning procedure as a min-max game between the model and a regularized implicit reward player parameterized by the model itself. This perspective unifies self-play imitation and general preference alignment within a common framework. Under this formulation, we present a game-theoretic analysis showing that the self-play finetuning will converge to it's equilibrium. Guided by this theoretical formulation, we propose a new self-play imitation finetuning algorithm based on the $χ^2$-divergence variational objective with bounded rewards and improved stability. Experiments on various of language model finetuning tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over existing self-play methods and validate our theoretical insights."}

Given the complexity of physical constraints, two challenges stand out. $(i)$ Physics-computation scalability: physics-informed learning can enforce physical regularization, but its computation (e.g., ODE integration) does not scale to extensive systems. $(ii)$ Knowledge-sharing efficiency: the attention mechanism is primarily computed within each system, which limits the extraction of shared ODE structures across systems. We show that enforcing ODE consistency does not require expensive nonlinear integration: a token-wise locally linear ODE representation preserves physical fidelity while scaling to foundation-model regimes. Thus, we propose novel token representations that respect locally linear ODE evolution. Such linearity substantially accelerates integration while accurately approximating the local data manifold. Second, we introduce a simple yet effective inter-system attention that augments attention with a common structure hub (CSH) that stores shared tokens and aggregates knowledge across systems. The resulting model, termed LASS-ODE (\\underline{LA}rge-\\underline{S}cale \\underline{S}mall \\underline{ODE}), is pretrained on our $40$GB ODE trajectory collections to enable strong in-domain performance, zero-shot generalization across diverse ODE systems, and additional improvements through fine-tuning."}

In this study, we propose Patch-based representation learning for time-series Anomaly detection (PaAno), a lightweight yet effective method for fast and efficient time-series anomaly detection. PaAno extracts short temporal patches from time-series training data and uses a 1D convolutional neural network to embed each patch into a vector representation. The model is trained using a combination of triplet loss and pretext loss to ensure the embeddings capture informative temporal patterns from input patches. During inference, the anomaly score at each time step is computed by comparing the embeddings of its surrounding patches to those of normal patches extracted from the training time-series. Evaluated on the TSB-AD benchmark, PaAno achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods, including those based on heavy architectures, on both univariate and multivariate time-series anomaly detection across various range-wise and point-wise performance measures."}

Despite extensive empirical observations, a fundamental understanding of CoT is lacking--what constitutes faithful CoT reasoning, and how unfaithfulness emerges from autoregressive training. We study these questions using well-controlled synthetic experiments, training small transformers on noisy data to solve modular arithmetic expressions step by step, a task we term Arithmetic Expression Reasoning. We find that models can learn faithful reasoning that causally follows the underlying arithmetic rules, but only when the training noise is below a critical threshold, a phenomenon attributable to simplicity bias. At higher noise levels, training dynamics exhibit a transition from faithful stepwise reasoning to unfaithful skip-step reasoning via an intermediate mixed mode characterized by a transient increase in prediction entropy. Mechanistic analysis reveals that models learn to encode internal uncertainty by resolving inconsistent reasoning steps, which suggests the emergence of implicit self-verification from autoregressive training."}

Existing gradient-based jailbreak methods transfer poorly, as adversarial patterns overfit to a single white-box surrogate and fail to generalise to black-box models. In this work, we propose Universal and transferable jailbreak (UltraBreak), a framework that constrains adversarial patterns through transformations and regularisation in the vision space, while relaxing textual targets through semantic-based objectives. By defining its loss in the textual embedding space of the target LLM, UltraBreak discovers universal adversarial patterns that generalise across diverse jailbreak objectives. This combination of vision-level regularisation and semantically guided textual supervision mitigates surrogate overfitting and enables strong transferability across both models and attack targets. Extensive experiments show that UltraBreak consistently outperforms prior jailbreak methods. Further analysis reveals why earlier approaches fail to transfer, highlighting that smoothing the loss landscape via semantic objectives is crucial for enabling universal and transferable jailbreaks.

This severe data heterogeneity critically undermines the convergence stability, generalization ability, and ultimately the quality of service delivered by the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FLood, a novel FL framework inspired by out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. FLood dynamically counteracts the adverse effects of heterogeneity through a dual-weighting mechanism that jointly governs local training and global aggregation. At the client level, it adaptively reweights the supervised loss by upweighting pseudo-OOD samples, thereby encouraging more robust learning from distributionally misaligned or challenging data. At the server level, it refines model aggregation by weighting client contributions according to their OOD confidence scores, prioritizing updates from clients with higher in-distribution consistency and enhancing the global model's robustness and convergence stability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks under diverse non-IID settings demonstrate that FLood consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in both accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, FLood functions as an orthogonal plug-in module: it seamlessly integrates with existing FL algorithms to boost their performance under heterogeneity without modifying their core optimization logic. These properties make FLood a practical and scalable solution for deploying reliable intelligent services in real-world federated environments."}

While the most effective and popular estimators leverage the paired sampling heuristic to reduce estimation error, the theoretical mechanism driving this improvement has remained opaque. In this work, we provide an elegant and fundamental justification for paired sampling: we prove that the Shapley value depends exclusively on the odd component of the set function, and that paired sampling orthogonalizes the regression objective to filter out the irrelevant even component. Leveraging this insight, we propose OddSHAP, a novel consistent estimator that performs polynomial regression solely on the odd subspace. By utilizing the Fourier basis to isolate this subspace and employing a proxy model to identify high-impact interactions, OddSHAP overcomes the combinatorial explosion of higher-order approximations. Through an extensive benchmark evaluation, we find that OddSHAP achieves state-of-the-art estimation accuracy."}

Current mixed-precision training approaches either apply uniform precision to all GEMM operations or rely on heuristic-based methods that fail to generalize during training, leading to suboptimal convergence and instability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SNIP, a fine-grained adaptive mixed-precision training framework for LLM pretraining that supports subbyte precision. SNIP periodically collects statistics on activations, gradients, and optimizer states to assess the precision loss impact on model quality. We define two key metrics: loss divergence in the forward pass, caused by quantization-induced increases in training loss, and weight divergence in the backward pass, which measures error propagation through gradients affecting model updates. These metrics guide an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem that systematically optimizes layerwise precision to minimize overall quality loss while meeting efficiency targets. Experiments on 1B, 3B, 7B and 70B Llama-like models demonstrate that SNIP consistently outperforms existing baselines, reducing FLOPs by up to 80% while preserving model quality across different model sizes and training phases with minimal computational overhead."}

We attribute this to a mismatch typical in current SFT-RL pipelines: the distribution that generates the offline SFT data can differ substantially from the policy optimized during online RL, which learns from its own rollouts.\n  We propose PEAR (Policy Evaluation-inspired Algorithm for Offline Learning Loss Re-weighting), an SFT-stage method that corrects this mismatch and better prepares the model for RL. PEAR uses importance sampling to reweight the SFT loss, with three variants operating at the token, block, and sequence levels. It can be used to augment standard SFT objectives and incurs little additional training overhead once probabilities for the offline data are collected.\n  We conduct controlled experiments on verifiable reasoning games and mathematical reasoning tasks on Qwen 2.5 and 3 and DeepSeek-distilled models. PEAR consistently improves post-RL performance over canonical SFT, with pass at 8 gains up to a 14.6 percent on AIME2025.

We introduce a quantitative measure of watermark strength that governs statistical detectability and is maximized when tokens are deterministic functions of pseudorandom numbers. Using this measure, we fully characterize the trade-off as a constrained optimization problem and derive explicit Pareto curves for two existing watermarking schemes. Finally, we introduce a principled mechanism that injects pseudorandomness into draft-token acceptance, ensuring maximal watermark strength while maintaining speculative sampling efficiency.

A key challenge of MU is how to reliably audit whether a model has truly forgotten specified training data. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely used for unlearning auditing, where samples that evade membership detection are often regarded as successfully forgotten. After carefully revisiting the reliability of MIA, we show that this assumption is flawed: failed membership inference does not imply true forgetting. We theoretically demonstrate that MIA-based auditing, when formulated as a binary classification problem, inevitably incurs statistical errors whose magnitude cannot be observed during the auditing process. This leads to overly optimistic evaluations of unlearning performance, while incurring substantial computational overhead due to shadow model training. To address these limitations, we propose Statistical Membership Inference Attack (SMIA), a novel training-free and highly effective auditing framework. SMIA directly compares the distributions of member and non-member data using statistical tests, eliminating the need for learned attack models. Moreover, SMIA outputs both a forgetting rate and a corresponding confidence interval, enabling quantified reliability of the auditing results. Extensive experiments show that SMIA provides more reliable auditing with significantly lower computational cost than existing MIA-based approaches. Notably, the theoretical guarantees and empirical effectiveness of SMIA suggest it as a new paradigm for reliable machine unlearning auditing."}

While deep learning (DL) has been increasingly adopted in EPF to capture complex and nonlinear price dynamics, several important gaps persist: (i) limited attention to multi-day horizons beyond day-ahead forecasting, (ii) insufficient exploration of state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series DL models, and (iii) a predominant reliance on aggregated horizon-level evaluation that obscures time-of-day forecasting variation. To address these gaps, we propose a novel EPF framework that extends the forecast horizon to multi-day-ahead by systematically building forecasting models that leverage benchmarked SOTA time series DL models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation to analyse time-of-day forecasting performance by integrating model assessment at intraday interval levels across all five regions in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The results show that no single model consistently dominates across regions, metrics, and horizons. Overall, standard DL models deliver superior performance in most regions, while SOTA time series DL models demonstrate greater robustness to forecast horizon extension. Intraday interval-level evaluation reveals pronounced diurnal error patterns, indicating that absolute errors peak during the evening ramp, relative errors inflate during midday negative-price regimes, and directional accuracy degrades during periods of frequent trend changes. These findings suggest that future research on DL-based EPF can benefit from enriched feature representations and modelling strategies that enhance longer-term forecasting robustness while maintaining sensitivity to intraday volatility and structural price dynamics."}

To address this issue, a class of regularization methods that enforce consistency between imputed and fully observed data has emerged as a promising approach for improving model generalization, particularly in partially observed settings. We refer to this class of methods as Measure Consistency Regularization (MCR). Despite its empirical success in various applications, such as image inpainting, data imputation and semi-supervised learning, a fundamental understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of MCR remains limited. This paper bridges this gap by offering theoretical insights into why, when, and how MCR enhances imputation quality under partial observability, viewed through the lens of neural network distance.\n  Our theoretical analysis identifies the term responsible for MCR's generalization advantage and extends to the imperfect training regime, demonstrating that this advantage is not always guaranteed. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel training protocol that monitors the duality gap to determine an early stopping point that preserves the generalization benefit. We then provide detailed empirical evidence to support our theoretical claims and to show the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed stopping condition. We further provide a set of real-world data simulations to show the versatility of MCR under different model architectures designed for different data sources."}

In contrast, one-shot federated learning (OFL) alleviates these limitations by reducing communication to a single round, thereby lowering overhead and enhancing practical deployability. Nevertheless, most existing one-shot approaches remain either impractical or constrained, for example, they often depend on the availability of a public dataset, assume homogeneous client models, or require uploading additional data or model information. To overcome these issues, we introduce the Gaussian-Head OFL (GH-OFL) family, a suite of one-shot federated methods that assume class-conditional Gaussianity of pretrained embeddings. Clients transmit only sufficient statistics (per-class counts and first/second-order moments) and the server builds heads via three components: (i) Closed-form Gaussian heads (NB/LDA/QDA) computed directly from the received statistics; (ii) FisherMix, a linear head with cosine margin trained on synthetic samples drawn in an estimated Fisher subspace; and (iii) Proto-Hyper, a lightweight low-rank residual head that refines Gaussian logits via knowledge distillation on those synthetic samples. In our experiments, GH-OFL methods deliver state-of-the-art robustness and accuracy under strong non-IID skew while remaining strictly data-free."}

Naively scaling value functions -- including with a transformer architecture, which is known to be highly scalable -- often results in learning instability and worse performance. In this work, we ask what prevents transformers from scaling effectively for value functions? Through empirical analysis, we identify the critical failure mode in this scaling: attention scores collapse as capacity increases. Our key insight is that we can effectively prevent this collapse and stabilize training by controlling the entropy of the attention scores, thereby enabling the use of larger models. To this end, we propose Transformer Q-Learning (TQL), a method that unlocks the scaling potential of transformers in learning value functions in RL. Our approach yields up to a 43% improvement in performance when scaling from the smallest to the largest network sizes, while prior methods suffer from performance degradation."}

We employ multiple datasets, privacy configurations, and deployment scenarios, demonstrating that our method reliably regains utility. Our results show that generalized values are preferable to pure suppression, that the best data preparation strategy depends on the scenario, and that consistent data representations are crucial for maintaining downstream utility.

We propose a criterion that quantifies the displacement of the unit gradient to enable efficient transitions between low-rank gradient subspaces.

We introduce LLM-AutoOpt, a hybrid HPO framework that combines BO with LLM-based contextual reasoning. The framework encodes dataset meta-features, model descriptions, historical optimization outcomes, and target objectives as structured meta-knowledge within LLM prompts, using BO to initialize the search and mitigate cold-start effects.

We perform cross-mode activation patching of internal activations across speech modes, and use tri-modal interpolation to examine whether speech representations vary discretely or continuously. We use coarse-to-fine causal tracing and causal scrubbing to find localized causal structure, allowing us to find internal subspaces that are sufficient for cross-mode transfer. In order to determine how finely distributed these effects are within layers, we perform neuron-level activation patching. We discover that small but not distributed subsets of neurons, rather than isolated units, affect the cross-mode transfer. Our results show that speech modes lie on a shared continuous causal manifold, and cross-mode transfer is mediated by compact, layer-specific subspaces rather than diffuse activity.

In an effort to improve performance, a gated attention model that leverages a gating mechanism within the multi-head self-attention has recently been proposed as a promising alternative. Gated attention has been empirically demonstrated to increase the expressiveness of low-rank mapping in standard attention and even to eliminate the attention sink phenomenon. Despite its efficacy, a clear theoretical understanding of gated attention's benefits remains lacking in the literature. To close this gap, we rigorously show that each entry in a gated attention matrix or a multi-head self-attention matrix can be written as a hierarchical mixture of experts. By recasting learning as an expert estimation problem, we demonstrate that gated attention is more sample-efficient than multi-head self-attention. In particular, while the former needs only a polynomial number of data points to estimate an expert, the latter requires exponentially many data points to achieve the same estimation error. Furthermore, our analysis also provides a theoretical justification for why gated attention yields higher performance when a gate is placed at the output of the scaled dot product attention or the value map rather than at other positions in the multi-head self-attention architecture."}

In this work, we provide an elegant and fundamental justification for paired sampling: we prove that the Shapley value depends exclusively on the odd component of the set function, and that paired sampling orthogonalizes the regression objective to filter out the irrelevant even component. Leveraging this insight, we propose OddSHAP, a novel consistent estimator that performs polynomial regression solely on the odd subspace.

Though the straight-forward ''best-of-$N$'' (BoN) strategy has already demonstrated significant improvements in performance, it lacks principled guidance on the choice of $N$, budget allocation, and multi-stage decision-making, thereby leaving substantial room for optimization. While many works have explored such optimization, rigorous theoretical guarantees remain limited. In this work, we propose new methodologies to predict and improve scaling properties via tail-guided search. By estimating the tail distribution of rewards, our method predicts the scaling law of LLMs without the need for exhaustive evaluations. Leveraging this prediction tool, we introduce Scaling-Law Guided (SLG) Search, a new test-time algorithm that dynamically allocates compute to identify and exploit intermediate states with the highest predicted potential. We theoretically prove that SLG achieves vanishing regret compared to perfect-information oracles, and achieves expected rewards that would otherwise require a polynomially larger compute budget required when using BoN. Empirically, we validate our framework across different LLMs and reward models, confirming that tail-guided allocation consistently achieves higher reward yields than Best-of-$N$ under identical compute budgets.

However, many machine learning-based models such as neural operators exhibit spectral bias, attenuating high-frequency components that often encode small-scale structure. This limitation is particularly damaging in applications such as weather forecasting, where misrepresented high frequencies can induce long-horizon instability. To address this issue, we propose multi-scale wavelet transformers (MSWTs), which learn system dynamics in a tokenized wavelet domain. The wavelet transform explicitly separates low- and high-frequency content across scales. MSWTs leverage a wavelet-preserving downsampling scheme that retains high-frequency features and employ wavelet-based attention to capture dependencies across scales and frequency bands. Experiments on chaotic dynamical systems show substantial error reductions and improved long horizon spectral fidelity. On the ERA5 climate reanalysis, MSWTs further reduce climatological bias, demonstrating their effectiveness in a real-world forecasting setting."}

We introduce a decomposition-based causal discovery framework that separates each time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components and performs component-specific causal analysis. Trend components are assessed using stationarity tests, seasonal components using kernel-based dependence measures, and residual components using constraint-based causal discovery. The resulting component-level graphs are integrated into a unified multi-scale causal structure.

Through empirical analysis, we identify the critical failure mode in this scaling: attention scores collapse as capacity increases. Our key insight is that we can effectively prevent this collapse and stabilize training by controlling the entropy of the attention scores, thereby enabling the use of larger models. To this end, we propose Transformer Q-Learning (TQL), a method that unlocks the scaling potential of transformers in learning value functions in RL. Our approach yields up to a 43% improvement in performance when scaling from the smallest to the largest network sizes, while prior methods suffer from performance degradation."}

To improve generalization, we prove that vicinal risk, estimated through noise perturbation or mixup-based data augmentation, is bounded by the sum of empirical risk and a regularization term-either finite difference or the vicinal Jensen gap. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose an evolutionary feature construction framework that jointly optimizes empirical risk and the vicinal Jensen gap to control overfitting. Since datasets may vary in noise levels, we develop a noise estimation strategy to dynamically adjust regularization strength. Furthermore, to mitigate manifold intrusion-where data augmentation may generate unrealistic samples that fall outside the data manifold-we propose a manifold intrusion detection mechanism. Experimental results on 58 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Jensen gap minimization compared to other complexity measures.

The edge of stability phenomenon, introduced in Cohen et al.

In this regime, the \"Central Flow\", recently proposed in Cohen et al. (2025), provides an accurate ODE approximation to the GD dynamics over many architectures. In this work, we propose Rod Flow, an alternative ODE approximation, which carries the following advantages: (1) it rests on a principled derivation stemming from a physical picture of GD iterates as an extended one-dimensional object -- a \"rod\"; (2) it better captures GD dynamics for simple toy examples and matches the accuracy of Central Flow for representative neural network architectures, and (3) is explicit and cheap to compute. Theoretically, we prove that Rod Flow correctly predicts the critical sharpness threshold and explains self-stabilization in quartic potentials.

We show that this instability is not solely due to limited capacity: in the rank-1 regime, optimization is highly sensitive to the update direction. Concretely, pretrained vision and text features form mismatched anisotropic regions, yielding a dominant \"gap\" direction that acts like a translation component and disproportionately steers early gradients under rank-1 constraints. Analyzing pretrained representations, we identify a modality-gap axis that dominates early gradient flow, while a random rank-1 initialization is unlikely to align with it, leading to weak gradients and training collapse. We propose Gap-Init, a geometry-aware initialization that aligns the rank-1 LoRA direction with an estimated modality-gap vector from a small calibration set, while keeping the initial LoRA update zero. Across multiple vision-language tasks and backbones, Gap-Init consistently stabilizes rank-1 training and can match or outperform strong rank-8 baselines.

In this work, we reverse this paradigm by introducing a structural diagnostic framework. By performing a layer-wise decomposition of the NTK, we mathematically identify the ``Inlet Rank Collapse'': a phenomenon where the low-dimensional input coordinates fail to span the high-dimensional embedding space, creating a fundamental rank deficiency at the first layer that acts as an expressive bottleneck for the entire network. This framework provides a unified perspective to re-interpret PE, SIREN, and BN as different forms of rank restoration. Guided by this diagnosis, we derive a Rank-Expanding Initialization, a minimalist remedy that ensures the representation rank scales with the layer width without architectural modifications or computational overhead. Our results demonstrate that this principled remedy enables standard MLPs to achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, proving that the key to empowering INRs lies in the structural optimization of the initial rank propagation to effectively populate the latent space."}

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the standard solution, state-of-the-art pipelines often rely on explicit structural heuristics or memory-intensive node embeddings -- approaches that struggle to generalize or scale to massive graphs. Emerging Graph Transformers (GTs) offer a potential alternative but often incur significant overhead due to complex structural encodings, hindering their applications to large-scale link prediction. We challenge these sophisticated paradigms with PENCIL, an encoder-only plain Transformer that replaces hand-crafted priors with attention over sampled local subgraphs, retaining the scalability and hardware efficiency of standard Transformers. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that PENCIL extracts richer structural signals than GNNs, implicitly generalizing a broad class of heuristics and subgraph-based expressivity. Empirically, PENCIL outperforms heuristic-informed GNNs and is far more parameter-efficient than ID-embedding--based alternatives, while remaining competitive across diverse benchmarks -- even without node features. Our results challenge the prevailing reliance on complex engineering techniques, demonstrating that simple design choices are potentially sufficient to achieve the same capabilities."}

In this work, we study how implicit bias, defined as subtle statistical prejudice, accumulates and propagates within LLMs equipped with long-term memory. To support systematic analysis, we introduce the Decision-based Implicit Bias (DIB) Benchmark, a large-scale dataset comprising 3,776 decision-making scenarios across nine social domains, designed to quantify implicit bias in long-term decision processes. Using a realistic long-horizon simulation framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs integrated with three representative memory architectures on DIB and demonstrate that LLMs' implicit bias does not remain static but intensifies over time and propagates across unrelated domains. We further analyze mitigation strategies and show that a static system-level prompting baseline provides limited and short-lived debiasing effects. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Memory Tagging (DMT), an agentic intervention that enforces fairness constraints at memory write time. Extensive experimental results show that DMT substantially reduces bias accumulation and effectively curtails cross-domain bias propagation."}

Although the associated mean-field objective admits a unique mixed Nash equilibrium, the long-time behavior of the original MFL-DA for general nonconvex-nonconcave payoffs has remained largely open. Answering an open question posed by Wang and Chizat (COLT 2024), we provide a partial resolution by proving that this equilibrium is locally exponentially stable: if the initialization is sufficiently close in Wasserstein metric, the dynamics trends to the equilibrium at an exponential rate. The key to our analysis is to establish a coercivity estimate for the entropy near equilibrium via spectral analysis of the linearized operator. We show that this coercivity effectively reveals a local displacement convex-concave structure, thereby driving contraction. This result settles the local stability and quantitative rate questions of Wang and Chizat, leaving global convergence as a remaining open challenge."}

However, instead of explicitly performing temporal interaction through self-attention, linear models implicitly perform it based on stacked MLP structures, which may be insufficient in capturing the complex temporal dependencies and their performance still has potential for improvement. To this end, we propose a Lightweight Sparse Interaction Network (LSINet) for TSF task. Inspired by the sparsity of self-attention, we propose a Multihead Sparse Interaction Mechanism (MSIM). Different from self-attention, MSIM learns the important connections between time steps through sparsity-induced Bernoulli distribution to capture temporal dependencies for TSF. The sparsity is ensured by the proposed self-adaptive regularization loss. Moreover, we observe the shareability of temporal interactions and propose to perform Shared Interaction Learning (SIL) for MSIM to further enhance efficiency and improve convergence. LSINet is a linear model comprising only MLP structures with low overhead and equipped with explicit temporal interaction mechanisms. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that LSINet achieves both higher accuracy and better efficiency than advanced linear models and transformer models in TSF tasks.

The reduced memory footprint enables speculative decoding with a small draft model and a larger verifier. On Qwen3-32B at an 8k-token context window, Minima reduces peak VRAM from 64 GiB to 40 GiB.

One of the most common USD approaches is to maximize the Mutual Information (MI) between skill latent variables and states. However, MI-based methods tend to favor simple, static skills due to their invariance properties, limiting the discovery of dynamic, task-relevant behaviors. Distance-Maximizing Skill Discovery (DSD) promotes more dynamic skills by leveraging state-space distances, yet still fall short in encouraging comprehensive skill sets that engage all controllable factors or entities in the environment. In this work, we introduce SUSD, a novel framework that harnesses the compositional structure of environments by factorizing the state space into independent components (e.g., objects or controllable entities). SUSD allocates distinct skill variables to different factors, enabling more fine-grained control on the skill discovery process. A dynamic model also tracks learning across factors, adaptively steering the agent's focus toward underexplored factors. This structured approach not only promotes the discovery of richer and more diverse skills, but also yields a factorized skill representation that enables fine-grained and disentangled control over individual entities which facilitates efficient training of compositional downstream tasks via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL).

The reduced memory footprint enables speculative decoding with a small draft model and a larger verifier. On Qwen3-32B at an 8k-token context window, Minima reduces peak VRAM from 64 GiB to 40 GiB.

Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment.

One of the most common USD approaches is to maximize the Mutual Information (MI) between skill latent variables and states. However, MI-based methods tend to favor simple, static skills due to their invariance properties, limiting the discovery of dynamic, task-relevant behaviors. Distance-Maximizing Skill Discovery (DSD) promotes more dynamic skills by leveraging state-space distances, yet still fall short in encouraging comprehensive skill sets that engage all controllable factors or entities in the environment. In this work, we introduce SUSD, a novel framework that harnesses the compositional structure of environments by factorizing the state space into independent components (e.g., objects or controllable entities). SUSD allocates distinct skill variables to different factors, enabling more fine-grained control on the skill discovery process. A dynamic model also tracks learning across factors, adaptively steering the agent's focus toward underexplored factors. This structured approach not only promotes the discovery of richer and more diverse skills, but also yields a factorized skill representation that enables fine-grained and disentangled control over individual entities which facilitates efficient training of compositional downstream tasks via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). Our experimental results across three environments, with factors ranging from 1 to 10, demonstrate that our method can discover diverse and complex skills without supervision, significantly outperforming existing unsupervised skill discovery methods in factorized and complex environments.

Drawing inspiration from physics, we identify three constraints that any generalizing system must satisfy: (1) Locality -- information propagates at finite speed; (2) Symmetry -- the laws of computation are invariant across space and time; (3) Stability -- the system converges to discrete attractors that resist noise accumulation. From these postulates, we derive -- rather than design -- the Spatiotemporal Evolution with Attractor Dynamics (SEAD) architecture: a neural cellular automaton where local convolutional rules are iterated until convergence. Experiments on three tasks validate our theory: (1) Parity -- demonstrating perfect length generalization via light-cone propagation; (2) Addition -- achieving scale-invariant inference from L=16 to L=1 million with 100% accuracy, exhibiting input-adaptive computation; (3) Rule 110 -- learning a Turing-complete cellular automaton without trajectory divergence.

These methods typically rely on a reward model, often distributed with public weights on platforms such as Hugging Face, to provide feedback to the bandit. While online evaluation is expensive and requires repeated trials, offline evaluation with logged data has become an attractive alternative. However, the adversarial robustness of offline bandit evaluation remains largely unexplored, particularly when an attacker perturbs the reward model (rather than the training data) prior to bandit training. In this work, we fill this gap by investigating, both theoretically and empirically, the vulnerability of offline bandit training to adversarial manipulations of the reward model. We introduce a novel threat model in which an attacker exploits offline data in high-dimensional settings to hijack the bandit's behavior. Starting with linear reward functions and extending to nonlinear models such as ReLU neural networks, we study attacks on two Hugging Face evaluators used for generative model assessment: one measuring aesthetic quality and the other assessing compositional alignment. Our results show that even small, imperceptible perturbations to the reward model's weights can drastically alter the bandit's behavior. From a theoretical perspective, we prove a striking high-dimensional effect: as input dimensionality increases, the perturbation norm required for a successful attack decreases, making modern applications such as image evaluation especially vulnerable. Extensive experiments confirm that naive random perturbations are ineffective, whereas carefully targeted perturbations achieve near-perfect attack success rates ..."}

We show that this fixed geometry leads to highly conservative, volume-inefficient prediction regions when environments undergo structural shifts. To address this, we propose \\textbf{AdaptNC}, a framework for the joint online adaptation of both the nonconformity score parameters and the conformal threshold. AdaptNC leverages an adaptive reweighting scheme to optimize score functions, and introduces a replay buffer mechanism to mitigate the coverage instability that occurs during score transitions.

By integrating a many-body attention mechanism and higher-order edge modeling, MBGen comprehensively leverages the rich structural information encoded in MS/MS spectra, enabling accurate de novo generation and isomer differentiation for novel molecules. Experimental results on the NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym benchmarks demonstrate that MBGen achieves superior performance, with improvements of up to 230% over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the scientific value and practical utility of many-body modeling for mass spectrometry-based molecular generation. Further analysis and ablation studies show that our approach effectively captures higher-order interactions and exhibits enhanced sensitivity to complex isomeric and non-local fragmentation information."}

Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment. This taxonomy provides a foundation for unifying fragmented research efforts and enabling the next generation of spatially-aware autonomous systems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial intelligence."}

From these postulates, we derive -- rather than design -- the Spatiotemporal Evolution with Attractor Dynamics (SEAD) architecture: a neural cellular automaton where local convolutional rules are iterated until convergence.

To mitigate the quadratic complexity of standard full attention, various efficient attention mechanisms, such as linear and hybrid attention, have been developed. A fundamental gap remains: their expressive power relative to full attention lacks a rigorous theoretical characterization. In this work, we theoretically characterize the performance differences among these attention mechanisms. Our theory applies to all linear attention variants that can be formulated as a recurrence, including Mamba, DeltaNet, etc. Specifically, we establish an expressiveness hierarchy: for the sequential function composition-a multi-step reasoning task that must occur within a model's forward pass, an ($L+1$)-layer full attention network is sufficient, whereas any hybrid network interleaving $L-1$ layers of full attention with a substantially larger number ($2^{3L^2}$) of linear attention layers cannot solve it. This result demonstrates a clear separation in expressive power between the two types of attention. Our work provides the first provable separation between hybrid attention and standard full attention, offering a theoretical perspective for understanding the fundamental capabilities and limitations of different attention mechanisms."}

These methods typically rely on a reward model, often distributed with public weights on platforms such as Hugging Face, to provide feedback to the bandit. While online evaluation is expensive and requires repeated trials, offline evaluation with logged data has become an attractive alternative. However, the adversarial robustness of offline bandit evaluation remains largely unexplored, particularly when an attacker perturbs the reward model (rather than the training data) prior to bandit training. In this work, we fill this gap by investigating, both theoretically and empirically, the vulnerability of offline bandit training to adversarial manipulations of the reward model. We introduce a novel threat model in which an attacker exploits offline data in high-dimensional settings to hijack the bandit's behavior. Starting with linear reward functions and extending to nonlinear models such as ReLU neural networks, we study attacks on two Hugging Face evaluators used for generative model assessment: one measuring aesthetic quality and the other assessing compositional alignment. Our results show that even small, imperceptible perturbations to the reward model's weights can drastically alter the bandit's behavior. From a theoretical perspective, we prove a striking high-dimensional effect: as input dimensionality increases, the perturbation norm required for a successful attack decreases, making modern applications such as image evaluation especially vulnerable. Extensive experiments confirm that naive random perturbations are ineffective, whereas carefully targeted perturbations achieve near-perfect attack success rates ..."}

Designed as an efficient, plug-in module, CoMeT can be integrated into pre-trained models with only minimal fine-tuning. It operates on sequential data chunks, using a dual-memory system to manage context: a temporary memory on a FIFO queue for recent events, and a global memory with a gated update rule for long-range dependencies. These memories then act as a dynamic soft prompt for the next chunk. To enable efficient fine-tuning on extremely long contexts, we introduce a novel layer-level pipeline parallelism strategy. The effectiveness of our approach is remarkable: a model equipped with CoMeT and fine-tuned on 32k contexts can accurately retrieve a passkey from any position within a 1M token sequence. On the SCROLLS benchmark, CoMeT surpasses other efficient methods and achieves performance comparable to a full-attention baseline on summarization tasks.

To expose the implicit model multiplicity underlying CP, we build on recent results showing that, under a mild assumption, any full CP procedure induces a set of closed and convex predictive distributions, commonly referred to as a credal set. Importantly, the conformal prediction region (CPR) coincides exactly with the set of labels to which all distributions in the induced credal set assign probability at least $1-α$. As our first contribution, we prove that this characterisation also holds in split CP. Building on this connection, we then propose a computationally efficient and analytically tractable uncertainty measure, based on \\emph{Maximum Mean Imprecision}, to quantify the EPU by measuring the degree of conflicting information within the induced credal set. Experiments on active learning and selective classification demonstrate that the quantified EPU provides substantially more informative and fine-grained uncertainty assessments than reliance on CPR size alone.

Due to the lack of access to internal states, such feedback overlooks the fine-grained conflicts between different modalities that lead to hallucinations during generation.\n  To address this issue, we propose IRIS (Implicit Reward-Guided Internal Sifting), which leverages continuous implicit rewards in the native log-probability space to preserve full information density and capture internal modal competition. This on-policy paradigm eliminates learnability gaps by utilizing self-generated preference pairs. By sifting these pairs based on multimodal implicit rewards, IRIS ensures that optimization is driven by signals that directly resolve modal conflicts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IRIS achieves highly competitive performance on key hallucination benchmarks using only 5.7k samples, without requiring any external feedback during preference alignment. These results confirm that IRIS provides an efficient and principled paradigm for mitigating MLLM hallucinations."}

The learner aims to recommend actions that perform well under the agent's true objective, and the performance is measured by the regret, defined as the cumulative gap between the agent's optimal values and those achieved by the learner's recommended actions. Prior work has established a regret bound of $O(d\\log T)$, as well as a finite but exponentially large bound of $\\exp(O(d\\log d))$, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization problem and $T$ is the time horizon, while a regret lower bound of $Ω(d)$ is known (Gollapudi et al. 2021; Sakaue et al. 2025). Whether a finite regret bound polynomial in $d$ is achievable or not has remained an open question. We partially resolve this by showing that when the feasible sets are M-convex -- a broad class that includes matroids -- a finite regret bound of $O(d\\log d)$ is possible. We achieve this by combining a structural characterization of optimal solutions on M-convex sets with a geometric volume argument.

In high-dimensional settings, however, classical results from statistical decision theory show that unbiased estimators are generally inadmissible under quadratic loss, suggesting that standard stochastic gradients may be suboptimal from a risk perspective. In this work, we formulate stochastic gradient computation as a high-dimensional estimation problem and introduce a decision-theoretic framework based on Stein-rule shrinkage. We construct a shrinkage gradient estimator that adaptively contracts noisy mini-batch gradients toward a stable restricted estimator derived from historical momentum. The shrinkage intensity is determined in a data-driven manner using an online estimate of gradient noise variance, leveraging second-moment statistics commonly maintained by adaptive optimization methods. Under a Gaussian noise model and for dimension p>=3, we show that the proposed estimator uniformly dominates the standard stochastic gradient under squared error loss and is minimax-optimal in the classical decision-theoretic sense. We further demonstrate how this estimator can be incorporated into the Adam optimizer, yielding a practical algorithm with negligible additional computational cost. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, across multiple levels of label noise, show consistent improvements over Adam in the large-batch regime. Ablation studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from selectively applying shrinkage to high-dimensional convolutional layers, while indiscriminate shrinkage across all parameters degrades performance. These results illustrate that classical shrinkage principles provide a principled and effective approach to improving stochastic gradient estimation in modern deep learning."}

Meanwhile, we find that the mismatch can be effectively suppressed by shrinking the update size. Taken together, we deduce that the mismatch is not merely a static numerical discrepancy, but a dynamic failure coupled with the model's optimization. Based on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution: a specialized Learning Rate (LR) scheduler. Instead of pre-defined decay schedule in traditional LR scheduler, our method dynamically triggers LR decay based on response length, which we identify as a reliable early-warning signal for impending instability.

Despite their simplicity and intuition, these methods overlook the latent intercellular relationships driven by the functional mechanisms of biological systems and the inherent quality issues of the raw sequence data. Therefore, a series of structured methods has emerged. Although they employ various heuristic rules to capture intricate intercellular relationships and enhance the raw sequencing data, these methods often neglect biological prior knowledge.

Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models."}

We propose T-LLM, a temporal distillation framework that equips general-purpose LLMs with time series forecasting capability by transferring predictive behavior from a lightweight temporal teacher during training. The teacher combines trend modeling and frequency-domain analysis to provide structured temporal supervision, and is removed entirely at inference, leaving the LLM as the sole forecasting model.

To mitigate the quadratic complexity of standard full attention, various efficient attention mechanisms, such as linear and hybrid attention, have been developed. A fundamental gap remains: their expressive power relative to full attention lacks a rigorous theoretical characterization. In this work, we theoretically characterize the performance differences among these attention mechanisms. Our theory applies to all linear attention variants that can be formulated as a recurrence, including Mamba, DeltaNet, etc. Specifically, we establish an expressiveness hierarchy: for the sequential function composition-a multi-step reasoning task that must occur within a model's forward pass, an ($L+1$)-layer full attention network is sufficient, whereas any hybrid network interleaving $L-1$ layers of full attention with a substantially larger number ($2^{3L^2}$) of linear attention layers cannot solve it. This result demonstrates a clear separation in expressive power between the two types of attention. Our work provides the first provable separation between hybrid attention and standard full attention, offering a theoretical perspective for understanding the fundamental capabilities and limitations of different attention mechanisms."}

Designed as an efficient, plug-in module, CoMeT can be integrated into pre-trained models with only minimal fine-tuning. It operates on sequential data chunks, using a dual-memory system to manage context: a temporary memory on a FIFO queue for recent events, and a global memory with a gated update rule for long-range dependencies.

This on-policy paradigm eliminates learnability gaps by utilizing self-generated preference pairs. By sifting these pairs based on multimodal implicit rewards, IRIS ensures that optimization is driven by signals that directly resolve modal conflicts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IRIS achieves highly competitive performance on key hallucination benchmarks using only 5.7k samples, without requiring any external feedback during preference alignment.

For example, a grounding query that previously activated localization experts may instead be routed to irrelevant experts after learning OCR tasks. Meanwhile, the grounding-related experts can be overwritten by new tasks and lose their original functionality. Such failure reflects two problems: router drift, where expert selection becomes inconsistent over time, and expert drift, where shared experts are overwritten across tasks. Therefore, we propose StAbilized Mixture-of-Experts (SAME) for MCIT. To address router drift, SAME stabilizes expert selection by decomposing routing dynamics into orthogonal subspaces and updating only task-relevant directions. To mitigate expert drift, we regulate expert updates via curvature-aware scaling using historical input covariance in a rehearsal-free manner.

However, deploying DNNs on resource-constrained devices, e.g., in RISC-V platforms, remains challenging due to the high computational and memory demands of fully connected (FC) layers, which dominate resource consumption. Low-rank factorization (LRF) offers an effective approach to compressing FC layers, but the vast design space of LRF solutions involves complex trade-offs among FLOPs, memory size, inference time, and accuracy, making the LRF process complex and time-consuming. This paper introduces an end-to-end LRF design space exploration methodology and a specialized design tool for optimizing FC layers on RISC-V processors. Using Tensor Train Decomposition (TTD) offered by TensorFlow T3F library, the proposed work prunes the LRF design space by excluding first, inefficient decomposition shapes and second, solutions with poor inference performance on RISC-V architectures. Compiler optimizations are then applied to enhance custom T3F layer performance, minimizing inference time and boosting computational efficiency. On average, our TT-decomposed layers run 3x faster than IREE and 8x faster than Pluto on the same compressed model. This work provides an efficient solution for deploying DNNs on edge and embedded devices powered by RISC-V architectures."}

While this paradigm has driven substantial progress, it proves insufficient in adaptive and multi-turn settings where forecasting requires informative feature extraction, reasoning-driven inference, iterative refinement, and continual adaptation over time. In this paper, we argue for agentic time series forecasting (ATSF), which reframes forecasting as an agentic process composed of perception, planning, action, reflection, and memory. Rather than focusing solely on predictive models, ATSF emphasizes organizing forecasting as an agentic workflow that can interact with tools, incorporate feedback from outcomes, and evolve through experience accumulation. We outline three representative implementation paradigms -- workflow-based design, agentic reinforcement learning, and a hybrid agentic workflow paradigm -- and discuss the opportunities and challenges that arise when shifting from model-centric prediction to agentic forecasting. Together, this position aims to establish agentic forecasting as a foundation for future research at the intersection of time series forecasting."}

However, existing pruning techniques often suffer severe degradation on generative reasoning tasks. Through a systematic study across multiple model families, we find that tasks requiring multi-step reasoning are particularly sensitive to depth reduction. Beyond surface-level text degeneration, we observe degradation of critical algorithmic capabilities, including arithmetic computation for mathematical reasoning and balanced parenthesis generation for code synthesis. Under realistic post-training constraints, without access to pretraining-scale data or compute, we evaluate a simple mitigation strategy based on supervised finetuning with Self-Generated Responses. This approach achieves strong recovery on classification tasks, retaining up to 90\\% of baseline performance, and yields substantial gains of up to 20--30 percentage points on generative benchmarks compared to prior post-pruning techniques. Crucially, despite these gains, recovery for generative reasoning remains fundamentally limited relative to classification tasks and is viable primarily at lower pruning ratios. Overall, we characterize the practical limits of layer pruning for generative reasoning and provide guidance on when depth reduction can be applied effectively under constrained post-training regimes."}

In high-dimensional settings, however, classical results from statistical decision theory show that unbiased estimators are generally inadmissible under quadratic loss, suggesting that standard stochastic gradients may be suboptimal from a risk perspective. In this work, we formulate stochastic gradient computation as a high-dimensional estimation problem and introduce a decision-theoretic framework based on Stein-rule shrinkage. We construct a shrinkage gradient estimator that adaptively contracts noisy mini-batch gradients toward a stable restricted estimator derived from historical momentum. The shrinkage intensity is determined in a data-driven manner using an online estimate of gradient noise variance, leveraging second-moment statistics commonly maintained by adaptive optimization methods. Under a Gaussian noise model and for dimension p>=3, we show that the proposed estimator uniformly dominates the standard stochastic gradient under squared error loss and is minimax-optimal in the classical decision-theoretic sense. We further demonstrate how this estimator can be incorporated into the Adam optimizer, yielding a practical algorithm with negligible additional computational cost. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, across multiple levels of label noise, show consistent improvements over Adam in the large-batch regime. Ablation studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from selectively applying shrinkage to high-dimensional convolutional layers, while indiscriminate shrinkage across all parameters degrades performance. These results illustrate that classical shrinkage principles provide a principled and effective approach to improving stochastic gradient estimation in modern deep learning."}

However, these rewards are inherently sparse, failing to provide the fine-grained supervision necessary for generating complex, long-form trajectories. Furthermore, current work treats the Judge as a black-box oracle, discarding the rich intermediate feedback signals encoded in it. To address these limitations, we introduce Grad2Reward, a novel framework that extracts dense process rewards directly from the Judge's model inference process via a single backward pass. By leveraging gradient-based attribution, Grad2Reward enables precise token-level credit assignment, substantially enhancing training efficiency and reasoning quality. Additionally, Grad2Reward introduces a self-judging mechanism, allowing the policy to improve through its own evaluative signals without training specialized reward models or reliance on superior external Judges. The experiments demonstrate that policies optimized with Grad2Reward achieve outstanding performance across diverse open-ended tasks, affirming its effectiveness and broad generalizability."}

Offline RL tends to get stuck in local optima, and in FRL, one device's suboptimal policy can degrade the aggregated model, i.e., policy pollution. We present FORLER, combining Q-ensemble aggregation on the server with actor rectification on devices. The server robustly merges device Q-functions to curb policy pollution and shift heavy computation off resource-constrained hardware without compromising privacy. Locally, actor rectification enriches policy gradients via a zeroth-order search for high-Q actions plus a bespoke regularizer that nudges the policy toward them. A $δ$-periodic strategy further reduces local computation. We theoretically provide safe policy improvement performance guarantees.

In this work, we analyze this instability through the lens of optimization, demonstrating that gradient noise and training-inference mismatch escalate in tandem as training progresses. Meanwhile, we find that the mismatch can be effectively suppressed by shrinking the update size. Taken together, we deduce that the mismatch is not merely a static numerical discrepancy, but a dynamic failure coupled with the model's optimization. Based on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution: a specialized Learning Rate (LR) scheduler. Instead of pre-defined decay schedule in traditional LR scheduler, our method dynamically triggers LR decay based on response length, which we identify as a reliable early-warning signal for impending instability. Empirical evidence suggests that by reducing the learning rate as gradient noise rises, we can consistently stabilize RL training and keep the training-inference mismatch at a safe level."}

We introduce FiLoRA (Focus-and-Ignore LoRA), an instruction-conditioned, parameter-efficient adaptation framework that enables explicit control over internal feature reliance while keeping the predictive objective fixed. FiLoRA decomposes adaptation into feature group-aligned LoRA modules and applies instruction-conditioned gating, allowing natural language instructions to act as computation-level control signals rather than task redefinitions. Across text--image and audio--visual benchmarks, we show that instruction-conditioned gating induces consistent and causal shifts in internal computation, selectively amplifying or suppressing core and spurious feature groups without modifying the label space or training objective. Further analyses demonstrate that FiLoRA yields improved robustness under spurious feature interventions, revealing a principled mechanism to regulate reliance beyond correlation-driven learning."}

We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the capability of HGNNs to recover low-distortion representations on two synthetic regression problems, and show that their geometric inductive bias becomes helpful when the problem requires preserving metric structure. Additionally, we evaluate HGNNs on the tasks of link prediction and node classification by jointly analyzing predictive performance and embedding distortion, revealing that only link prediction is geometry-aligned.

Despite their simplicity and intuition, these methods overlook the latent intercellular relationships driven by the functional mechanisms of biological systems and the inherent quality issues of the raw sequence data. Therefore, a series of structured methods has emerged. Although they employ various heuristic rules to capture intricate intercellular relationships and enhance the raw sequencing data, these methods often neglect biological prior knowledge.

Furthermore, Gene Ontology is utilized to bridge the feature-level semantic gap by incorporating functional priors. In complex multi-species and multi-organ benchmarks, DOGMA achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot robustness and sample efficiency while operating with significantly lower computational cost."}

DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications.

To address these issues, we propose FUPareto, an efficient unlearning framework via Pareto-augmented optimization. We first introduce the Minimum Boundary Shift (MBS) Loss, which enforces unlearning by suppressing the target class logit below the highest non-target class logit; this can improve the unlearning efficiency and mitigate MIA risks. During the unlearning process, FUPareto performs Pareto improvement steps to preserve model utility and executes Pareto expansion to guarantee forgetting. Specifically, during Pareto expansion, the framework integrates a Null-Space Projected Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to decouple gradient conflicts.

A prominent approach is to fine-tune an existing model with an unlearning loss that retains overall utility. The space of suitable unlearning loss functions is vast, making the search for an optimal loss function daunting. Additionally, there might not even exist a universally optimal loss function: differences in the structure and overlap of the forget and retain data can cause a loss to work well in one setting but over-unlearn or under-unlearn in another. Our approach EvoMU tackles these two challenges simultaneously. An evolutionary search procedure automatically finds task-specific losses in the vast space of possible unlearning loss functions. This allows us to find dataset-specific losses that match or outperform existing losses from the literature, without the need for a human-in-the-loop. This work is therefore an instance of automatic scientific discovery, a.k.a. an AI co-scientist. In contrast to previous AI co-scientist works, we do so on a budget: We achieve SotA results using a small 4B parameter model (Qwen3-4B-Thinking), showing the potential of AI co-scientists with limited computational resources. Our experimental evaluation shows that we surpass previous loss-based unlearning formulations on TOFU-5%, TOFU-10%, MUSE and WMDP by synthesizing novel unlearning losses.

Yet, its application to time series experiments, where policies are sequentially assigned over time, remains challenging. Existing designs suffer from two limitations: (i) they do not fully leverage the entire history for treatment allocation; (ii) they rely on strong assumptions to approximate the objective function (e.g., the mean squared error of the estimated treatment effect) for optimizing the design. We first establish an impossibility theorem showing that failure to condition on the full history leads to suboptimal designs, due to the dynamic dependencies in time series experiments. To address both limitations simultaneously, we next propose a transformer reinforcement learning (RL) approach which leverages transformers to condition allocation on the entire history and employs RL to directly optimize the MSE without relying on restrictive assumptions. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data, a publicly available dispatch simulator, and a real-world ridesharing dataset demonstrate that our proposal consistently outperforms existing designs."}

To bridge this gap, we propose Back to the Future (BTTF), a simple yet effective framework that enhances forecasting stability through look-ahead augmentation and self-corrective refinement. Rather than relying on complex model architectures, BTTF revisits the fundamental forecasting process and refines a base model by ensembling the second-stage models augmented with their initial predictions. Despite its simplicity, our approach consistently improves long-horizon accuracy and mitigates the instability of linear forecasting models, achieving accuracy gains of up to 58% and demonstrating stable improvements even when the first-stage model is trained under suboptimal conditions. These results suggest that leveraging model-generated forecasts as augmentation can be a simple yet powerful way to enhance long-term prediction, even without complex architectures."}

To reduce overhead and improve exploration, prior work introduces tree structured rollouts, which share reasoning prefixes and branch at key nodes to improve sampling efficiency. However, this paradigm still faces two challenges: (1) high entropy branching can trigger rollout collapse, where the branching budget concentrates on a few trajectories with consecutive high-entropy segments, rapidly reducing the number of effective branches; (2) early pseudo-labels are noisy and biased, which can induce self-reinforcing overfitting, causing the policy to sharpen prematurely and suppress exploration. To address these issues, we propose Entropy Confidence Hybrid Group Relative Policy Optimization (ECHO). During rollout, ECHO jointly leverages local entropy and group level confidence to adaptively control branch width, and further introduces online confidence-based pruning to terminate persistently low confidence branches, avoiding high entropy traps and mitigating collapse. During policy updates, ECHO employs confidence adaptive clipping and an entropy confidence hybrid advantage shaping approach to enhance training robustness and mitigate early stage bias. Experiments demonstrate that ECHO achieves consistent gains on multiple mathematical and visual reasoning benchmarks, and generalizes more effectively under a limited rollout budget."}

While classical survival models such as Cox remain widely adopted in standard practice, they rely on restrictive assumptions, including linear covariate relationships and proportional hazards over time, that often fail to capture real-world clinical dynamics. Recent deep learning approaches like DeepSurv and DeepHit offer improved expressivity but sacrifice interpretability, limiting clinical adoption where trust and transparency are paramount. Hybrid models incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), such as CoxKAN, have begun to address this trade-off but remain constrained by the semi-parametric Cox framework. In this work we introduce SurvKAN, a fully parametric, time-continuous survival model based on KAN architectures that eliminates the proportional hazards constraint. SurvKAN treats time as an explicit input to a KAN that directly predicts the log-hazard function, enabling end-to-end training on the full survival likelihood. Our architecture preserves interpretability through learnable univariate functions that indicate how individual features influence risk over time. Extensive experiments on standard survival benchmarks demonstrate that SurvKAN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to classical and state-of-the-art baselines across concordance and calibration metrics.

This mechanism allows the design policy to expand or compress regions of the input space in response to observed variability, thereby shaping the behavior of variance-based acquisition functions.

In particular, we introduce the frame operator $F = WW^\\top$, which gives us a spectral measure that describes how each feature allocates norm across eigenspaces. While previous tools could describe the pairwise interactions between features, spectral methods capture the global geometry (``how do all features interact?''). In toy models of superposition, we use this theory to prove that capacity saturation forces spectral localization: features collapse onto single eigenspaces, organize into tight frames, and admit discrete classification via association schemes, classifying all geometries from prior work (simplices, polygons, antiprisms). The spectral measure formalism applies to arbitrary weight matrices, enabling diagnosis of feature localization beyond toy settings.

A closer examination reveals a defining Sparsity-Event Duality (SED) property of IMTS, i.e., long stretches with sparse or no observations are punctuated by short, dense bursts where most semantic events (observations) occur. However, existing Graph- and Transformer-based forecasters ignore SED: pre-alignment to uniform grids with heavy padding violates sparsity by inflating sequences and forcing computation at non-informative steps, while relational recasting weakens event semantics by disrupting local temporal continuity. These limitations motivate a more faithful and natural modeling paradigm for IMTS that aligns with its SED property. We find that Spiking Neural Networks meet this requirement, as they communicate via sparse binary spikes and update in an event-driven manner, aligning naturally with the SED nature of IMTS. Therefore, we present SEDformer, an SED-enhanced Spiking Transformer for telemetry IMTS forecasting that couples: (1) a SED-based Spike Encoder converts raw observations into event synchronous spikes using an Event-Aligned LIF neuron, (2) an Event-Preserving Temporal Downsampling module compresses long gaps while retaining salient firings and (3) a stack of SED-based Spike Transformer blocks enable intra-series dependency modeling with a membrane-based linear attention driven by EA-LIF spiking features. Experiments on public telemetry IMTS datasets show that SEDformer attains state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while reducing energy and memory usage, providing a natural and efficient path for modeling IMTS."}

Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models."}

To overcome these issues, we introduce a multi-stage physics-informed training strategy that achieves convergence by progressively enforcing boundary conditions in the loss landscape and subsequently incorporating interior residuals. At each stage the optimizer is re-initialized, acting as a continuation mechanism that restores stability and prevents gradient stagnation. We further propose the Physics-Informed Spline Fourier Neural Operator (PhIS-FNO), combining Fourier layers with Hermite spline kernels for smooth residual evaluation. Across canonical benchmarks, PhIS-FNO attains a level of accuracy comparable to that of supervised learning, using labeled information only along a narrow boundary region, establishing staged, spline-based optimization as a robust paradigm for physics-informed operator learning."}

The saddle-point dynamics of this energy perform inference and credit assignment simultaneously through local interactions. We term this framework ''Dyadic Backpropagation''. Crucially, we prove that unit-step Euler discretization, the natural timescale of layer transitions, recovers standard backpropagation exactly in precisely 2L steps for an L-layer network, with no approximations. Unlike prior energy-based methods requiring symmetric weights, asymptotic convergence, or vanishing perturbations, our framework guarantees exact gradients in finite time. This establishes backpropagation as the digitally optimized shadow of a continuous physical relaxation, providing a rigorous foundation for exact gradient computation in analog and neuromorphic substrates where continuous dynamics are native."}

Unlike data in vision and language domains, time series data is inherently tied to the evolution of underlying processes and can only accumulate as real-world time progresses, limiting the effectiveness of scale-driven pretraining alone. This time-bound constraint poses a challenge for enabling large language models (LLMs) to acquire forecasting capability, as existing approaches primarily rely on representation-level alignment or inference-time temporal modules rather than explicitly teaching forecasting behavior to the LLM. We propose T-LLM, a temporal distillation framework that equips general-purpose LLMs with time series forecasting capability by transferring predictive behavior from a lightweight temporal teacher during training. The teacher combines trend modeling and frequency-domain analysis to provide structured temporal supervision, and is removed entirely at inference, leaving the LLM as the sole forecasting model. Experiments on benchmark datasets and infectious disease forecasting tasks demonstrate that T-LLM consistently outperforms existing LLM-based forecasting methods under full-shot, few-shot, and zero-shot settings, while enabling a simple and efficient deployment pipeline."}

In this paper, we propose a novel training method for time-series forecasting that enforces two key properties: (1) AR prediction errors should increase with the forecasting horizon. Any violation of this principle is considered random guessing and is explicitly penalized in the loss function, and (2) the method enables models to concatenate short-term AR predictions for forming flexible long-term forecasts. Empirical results demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, achieving an MSE reduction of more than 10% compared to iTransformer and other recent strong baselines.

Moreover, to improve geometric consistency, we introduce a Boundary Cross-Attention (BCA) module that enables conditioning on building boundaries. Our experiments show that BCA significantly improves boundary adherence, while prolonged training drives diversity collapse undiagnosed by FID, revealing a critical trade-off between realism and diversity.

This has the disadvantage of limiting the applicability of the resulting model for other downstream tasks. Here, instead, we propose to represent the joint probability distribution by means of conditional probability distributions for each group of variables conditioned on the rest. Such models can then be used for practically any possible downstream task. Their learning can be approached as training a parametrised Markov chain kernel by maximising the data likelihood of its limiting distribution. This has the additional advantage of allowing a wide range of semi-supervised learning scenarios."}

ICL is strikingly sample-efficient, often learning from only a handful of demonstrations, but complex reasoning tasks typically demand many training examples to learn from. However, naively scaling ICL by adding more demonstrations breaks down at this scale: attention costs grow quadratically, performance saturates or degrades with longer contexts, and the approach remains a shallow form of learning. Due to these limitations, practitioners predominantly rely on in-weight learning (IWL) to induce reasoning. In this work, we show that by using Prefix Tuning, LLMs can learn to reason without overloading the context window and without any weight updates. We introduce $\\textbf{ReasonCACHE}$, an instantiation of this mechanism that distills demonstrations into a fixed key-value cache. Empirically, across challenging reasoning benchmarks, including GPQA-Diamond, ReasonCACHE outperforms standard ICL and matches or surpasses IWL approaches. Further, it achieves this all while being more efficient across three key axes: data, inference cost, and trainable parameters. We also theoretically prove that ReasonCACHE can be strictly more expressive than low-rank weight update since the latter ties expressivity to input rank, whereas ReasonCACHE bypasses this constraint by directly injecting key-values into the attention mechanism. Together, our findings identify ReasonCACHE as a middle path between in-context and in-weight learning, providing a scalable algorithm for learning reasoning skills beyond the context window without modifying parameters.

Theoretically grounded in a Bias-Variance Decomposition, our approach approximates EU via Jensen-Shannon divergence among drafts (variance proxy) and KL divergence between the draft mixture and the target (bias proxy). To further ensure accuracy without significant overhead, we introduce Online Stochastic Distillation (OSD) to efficiently approximate target aggregation and the Data-Diverse Drafts (DDD) strategy to enhance draft diversity for better target approximation. Extensive experiments on GSM8K demonstrate that our method reduces the estimation error (RMSE) by up to 37% compared to baselines.

To validate this threat, we present Slingshot, a 'cold-start' reinforcement learning framework that autonomously discovers emergent attack vectors, revealing a critical insight: in our setting, learned attacks tend to converge to short, instruction-like syntactic patterns rather than multi-turn persuasion. On held-out extreme-difficulty tasks, Slingshot achieves a 67.0% success rate against a Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ Operator (vs. 1.7% baseline), reducing the expected attempts to first success (on solved tasks) from 52.3 to 1.3.

A promising alternative is to leverage high-quality expert human solutions, yet naive imitation of this data fails because it is fundamentally out of distribution: expert solutions are typically didactic, containing implicit reasoning gaps intended for human readers rather than computational models. Furthermore, high-quality expert solutions are expensive, necessitating generalizable sample-efficient training methods. We propose Distribution Aligned Imitation Learning (DAIL), a two-step method that bridges the distributional gap by first transforming expert solutions into detailed, in-distribution reasoning traces and then applying a contrastive objective to focus learning on expert insights and methodologies.

Some higher-dimensional alternatives to self-attention have been proposed to address this, including higher-order attention and Strassen attention, which can perform some of these polyadic tasks in exchange for slower, superquadratic running times.\n  In this work, we define a vast class of generalizations of self-attention, which we call poly-attention mechanisms. Our mechanisms can incorporate arbitrary higher-order (tensor) computations as well as arbitrary relationship structures between the input tokens, and they include the aforementioned alternatives as special cases. We then systematically study their computational complexity and representational strength, including giving new algorithms and matching complexity-theoretic lower bounds on the time complexity of computing the attention matrix exactly as well as approximately, and tightly determining which polyadic tasks they can each perform. Our results give interesting trade-offs between different desiderata for these mechanisms, including a tight relationship between how expressive a mechanism is, and how large the coefficients in the model may be so that the mechanism can be approximated in almost-linear time.\n  Notably, we give a new attention mechanism which can be computed exactly in quadratic time, and which can perform function composition for any fixed number of functions.

First, by focusing solely on success, agents overlook the rich pedagogical value embedded in failed attempts, preventing them from identifying and avoiding recurrent pitfalls. Second, continually accumulating textual experiences not only increases the time consumption during retrieval but also inevitably introduces noise and exhausts the largest context window of current LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving framework for LLM agents that introduces a complementary evolution mechanism: First, a contrastive reflection strategy is introduced to explicitly summarize error-prone patterns and capture reusable insights. Second, we propose a self-consolidation mechanism that distills non-parametric textual experience into compact learnable parameters.

Accepted by ICLR 2026", "summary": "General continual learning (GCL) challenges intelligent systems to learn from single-pass, non-stationary data streams without clear task boundaries. While recent advances in continual parameter-efficient tuning (PET) of pretrained models show promise, they typically rely on multiple training epochs and explicit task cues, limiting their effectiveness in GCL scenarios. Moreover, existing methods often lack targeted design and fail to address two fundamental challenges in continual PET: how to allocate expert parameters to evolving data distributions, and how to improve their representational capacity under limited supervision. Inspired by the fruit fly's hierarchical memory system characterized by sparse expansion and modular ensembles, we propose FlyPrompt, a brain-inspired framework that decomposes GCL into two subproblems: expert routing and expert competence improvement. FlyPrompt introduces a randomly expanded analytic router for instance-level expert activation and a temporal ensemble of output heads to dynamically adapt decision boundaries over time. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate FlyPrompt's superior performance, achieving up to 11.23%, 12.43%, and 7.62% gains over state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200, respectively.

Recent methods leverage sparse expert routing to promote task specialization, but we find that the expert routing process suffers from drift as the data distribution evolves. For example, a grounding query that previously activated localization experts may instead be routed to irrelevant experts after learning OCR tasks. Meanwhile, the grounding-related experts can be overwritten by new tasks and lose their original functionality. Such failure reflects two problems: router drift, where expert selection becomes inconsistent over time, and expert drift, where shared experts are overwritten across tasks. Therefore, we propose StAbilized Mixture-of-Experts (SAME) for MCIT. To address router drift, SAME stabilizes expert selection by decomposing routing dynamics into orthogonal subspaces and updating only task-relevant directions. To mitigate expert drift, we regulate expert updates via curvature-aware scaling using historical input covariance in a rehearsal-free manner. SAME also introduces adaptive expert activation to freeze selected experts during training, reducing redundant computation and cross-task interference.

However, deploying DNNs on resource-constrained devices, e.g., in RISC-V platforms, remains challenging due to the high computational and memory demands of fully connected (FC) layers, which dominate resource consumption. Low-rank factorization (LRF) offers an effective approach to compressing FC layers, but the vast design space of LRF solutions involves complex trade-offs among FLOPs, memory size, inference time, and accuracy, making the LRF process complex and time-consuming. This paper introduces an end-to-end LRF design space exploration methodology and a specialized design tool for optimizing FC layers on RISC-V processors. Using Tensor Train Decomposition (TTD) offered by TensorFlow T3F library, the proposed work prunes the LRF design space by excluding first, inefficient decomposition shapes and second, solutions with poor inference performance on RISC-V architectures. Compiler optimizations are then applied to enhance custom T3F layer performance, minimizing inference time and boosting computational efficiency. On average, our TT-decomposed layers run 3x faster than IREE and 8x faster than Pluto on the same compressed model. This work provides an efficient solution for deploying DNNs on edge and embedded devices powered by RISC-V architectures."}

However, existing pruning techniques often suffer severe degradation on generative reasoning tasks. Through a systematic study across multiple model families, we find that tasks requiring multi-step reasoning are particularly sensitive to depth reduction. Beyond surface-level text degeneration, we observe degradation of critical algorithmic capabilities, including arithmetic computation for mathematical reasoning and balanced parenthesis generation for code synthesis. Under realistic post-training constraints, without access to pretraining-scale data or compute, we evaluate a simple mitigation strategy based on supervised finetuning with Self-Generated Responses. This approach achieves strong recovery on classification tasks, retaining up to 90\\% of baseline performance, and yields substantial gains of up to 20--30 percentage points on generative benchmarks compared to prior post-pruning techniques. Crucially, despite these gains, recovery for generative reasoning remains fundamentally limited relative to classification tasks and is viable primarily at lower pruning ratios. Overall, we characterize the practical limits of layer pruning for generative reasoning and provide guidance on when depth reduction can be applied effectively under constrained post-training regimes."}

LGVF couples two complementary mechanisms: (1) a training-time logic loss that penalizes constraint violations along continuous flow trajectories, with weights that emphasize correctness near the target distribution; and (2) an inference-time adjustment that steers sampling using constraint gradients, acting as a lightweight, logic-informed correction to the learned dynamics. We evaluate LGVF on three constrained generation case studies spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-region feasibility constraints. Across all settings, LGVF reduces constraint violations by 59-82% compared to standard flow matching and achieves the lowest violation rates in each case. In the linear and ring settings, LGVF also improves distributional fidelity as measured by MMD, while in the multi-obstacle setting, we observe a satisfaction-fidelity trade-off, with improved feasibility but increased MMD. Beyond quantitative gains, LGVF yields constraint-aware vector fields exhibiting emergent obstacle-avoidance behavior, routing samples around forbidden regions without explicit path planning."}

Most existing DG approaches focus on learning domain-invariant representations under the assumption of conditional distribution shift (i.e., primarily addressing changes in $P(X\\mid Y)$ while assuming $P(Y)$ remains stable). However, real-world scenarios with multiple domains often involve compound distribution shifts where both the marginal label distribution $P(Y)$ and the conditional distribution $P(X\\mid Y)$ vary simultaneously. To address this, we propose a unified framework for robust domain generalization under divergent marginal and conditional distributions. We derive a novel risk bound for unseen domains by explicitly decomposing the joint distribution into marginal and conditional components and characterizing risk gaps arising from both sources of divergence. To operationalize this bound, we design a meta-learning procedure that minimizes and validates the proposed risk bound across seen domains, ensuring strong generalization to unseen ones. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on conventional DG benchmarks but also in challenging multi-domain long-tailed recognition settings where both marginal and conditional shifts are pronounced."}

This study conducts a longitudinal analysis of outlier dynamics across architecture during NVFP4 pretraining, focusing on where they localize, why they occur, and how they evolve temporally. We find that, compared with Softmax Attention (SA), Linear Attention (LA) reduces per-tensor heavy tails but still exhibits persistent block-level spikes under block quantization. Our analysis attributes outliers to specific architectural components: Softmax in SA, gating in LA, and SwiGLU in FFN, with \"post-QK\" operations exhibiting higher sensitivity to quantization. Notably, outliers evolve from transient spikes early in training to a small set of persistent hot channels (i.e., channels with persistently large magnitudes) in later stages. Based on these findings, we introduce Hot-Channel Patch (HCP), an online compensation mechanism that identifies hot channels and reinjects residuals using hardware-efficient kernels. We then develop CHON, an NVFP4 training recipe integrating HCP with post-QK operation protection. On GLA-1.3B model trained for 60B tokens, CHON reduces the loss gap to BF16 from 0.94% to 0.58% while maintaining downstream accuracy."}

Offline RL tends to get stuck in local optima, and in FRL, one device's suboptimal policy can degrade the aggregated model, i.e., policy pollution. We present FORLER, combining Q-ensemble aggregation on the server with actor rectification on devices. The server robustly merges device Q-functions to curb policy pollution and shift heavy computation off resource-constrained hardware without compromising privacy. Locally, actor rectification enriches policy gradients via a zeroth-order search for high-Q actions plus a bespoke regularizer that nudges the policy toward them. A $δ$-periodic strategy further reduces local computation. We theoretically provide safe policy improvement performance guarantees. Extensive experiments show FORLER consistently outperforms strong baselines under varying data quality and heterogeneity."}

We introduce FiLoRA (Focus-and-Ignore LoRA), an instruction-conditioned, parameter-efficient adaptation framework that enables explicit control over internal feature reliance while keeping the predictive objective fixed. FiLoRA decomposes adaptation into feature group-aligned LoRA modules and applies instruction-conditioned gating, allowing natural language instructions to act as computation-level control signals rather than task redefinitions. Across text--image and audio--visual benchmarks, we show that instruction-conditioned gating induces consistent and causal shifts in internal computation, selectively amplifying or suppressing core and spurious feature groups without modifying the label space or training objective. Further analyses demonstrate that FiLoRA yields improved robustness under spurious feature interventions, revealing a principled mechanism to regulate reliance beyond correlation-driven learning."}

In this paper, we develop a joint routing and scheduling algorithm that leverages ``implicit\" feedback inferred from user retrial behaviors. The key idea is to propose and study the framework of contextual queueing bandits with multinomial logit feedback (CQB-MNL). CQB-MNL models query retrials, as well as context-based learning for user preferences over LLMs. Our algorithm, anytime CQB (ACQB), achieves efficient learning while maintaining queue stability by combining Thompson sampling with forced exploration at a decaying rate.

In contrast to the weaker notion of external regret minimization - a problem which is fairly well understood in the literature - achieving no-swap regret with a polylogarithmic dependence on $N$ has remained elusive in combinatorial bandits.

However, running world models rely on hevay computational cost and memory footprint, making model quantization essential for efficient deployment. To date, the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ) on world models remain largely unexamined. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of world model quantization using DINO-WM as a representative case, evaluating diverse PTQ methods under both weight-only and joint weight-activation settings. We conduct extensive experiments on different visual planning tasks across a wide range of bit-widths, quantization granularities, and planning horizons up to 50 iterations. Our results show that quantization effects in world models extend beyond standard accuracy and bit-width trade-offs: group-wise weight quantization can stabilize low-bit rollouts, activation quantization granularity yields inconsistent benefits, and quantization sensitivity is highly asymmetric between encoder and predictor modules. Moreover, aggressive low-bit quantization significantly degrades the alignment between the planning objective and task success, leading to failures that cannot be remedied by additional optimization. These findings reveal distinct quantization-induced failure modes in world model-based planning and provide practical guidance for deploying quantized world models under strict computational constraints.

Prior work either hard-codes an ordering (e.g., blockwise left-to-right) or learns an ordering policy for a pretrained MDM, which incurs extra cost and can yield suboptimal solutions due to the two-stage optimization. Motivated by this, we propose order-expressive masked diffusion model (OeMDM) for a broad class of diffusion generative processes with various generation orders, enabling the interpretation of MDM, ARM, and block diffusion in a single framework. Furthermore, building on OeMDM, we introduce learnable-order masked diffusion model (LoMDM), which jointly learns the generation ordering and diffusion backbone through a single objective from scratch, enabling the diffusion model to generate text in context-dependent ordering. Empirically, we confirm that LoMDM outperforms various discrete diffusion models across multiple language modeling benchmarks."}

While maximizing VNE under constraints is well known in quantum settings, a principled analogue of the classical maximum entropy framework, particularly its decision theoretic and game theoretic interpretation, has not been explicitly developed for VNE in data driven contexts. In this paper, we extend the minimax formulation of the maximum entropy principle due to Grünwald and Dawid to the setting of von Neumann entropy, providing a game-theoretic justification for VNE maximization over density matrices and trace-normalized positive semidefinite operators. This perspective yields a robust interpretation of maximum VNE solutions under partial information and clarifies their role as least committed inferences in spectral domains. We then illustrate how the resulting Maximum VNE principle applies to modern machine learning problems by considering two representative applications, selecting a kernel representation from multiple normalized embeddings via kernel-based VNE maximization, and completing kernel matrices from partially observed entries. These examples demonstrate how the proposed framework offers a unifying information-theoretic foundation for VNE-based methods in kernel learning."}

In this work, we propose a two-stage optimization framework for group scales that explicitly minimizes the layer-wise reconstruction loss.

In the second stage, we freeze the integer weights obtained via GPTQ and refine the group scales to minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss. To this end, we employ the coordinate descent algorithm and derive a closed-form update rule, which enables efficient refinement without costly numerical optimization.

This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations.

A prominent approach is to fine-tune an existing model with an unlearning loss that retains overall utility. The space of suitable unlearning loss functions is vast, making the search for an optimal loss function daunting. Additionally, there might not even exist a universally optimal loss function: differences in the structure and overlap of the forget and retain data can cause a loss to work well in one setting but over-unlearn or under-unlearn in another. Our approach EvoMU tackles these two challenges simultaneously. An evolutionary search procedure automatically finds task-specific losses in the vast space of possible unlearning loss functions. This allows us to find dataset-specific losses that match or outperform existing losses from the literature, without the need for a human-in-the-loop. This work is therefore an instance of automatic scientific discovery, a.k.a. an AI co-scientist. In contrast to previous AI co-scientist works, we do so on a budget: We achieve SotA results using a small 4B parameter model (Qwen3-4B-Thinking), showing the potential of AI co-scientists with limited computational resources.

To this end, we synthesize selection tasks from large-scale math and code instruction datasets by filtering to instances with both correct and incorrect candidate solutions, and train 1.7B-parameter models with DAPO to reward correct selections. Across math (AIME24, AIME25, HMMT25) and code (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks, our models consistently outperform prompting and majority-voting baselines, often approaching or exceeding much larger models. Moreover, these gains generalize to selecting outputs from stronger models despite training only on outputs from weaker models. Overall, our results establish reinforcement learning as a scalable way to unlock strong generative selection in small models, enabling efficient test-time scaling."}

To bridge this gap, we propose Back to the Future (BTTF), a simple yet effective framework that enhances forecasting stability through look-ahead augmentation and self-corrective refinement. Rather than relying on complex model architectures, BTTF revisits the fundamental forecasting process and refines a base model by ensembling the second-stage models augmented with their initial predictions. Despite its simplicity, our approach consistently improves long-horizon accuracy and mitigates the instability of linear forecasting models, achieving accuracy gains of up to 58% and demonstrating stable improvements even when the first-stage model is trained under suboptimal conditions. These results suggest that leveraging model-generated forecasts as augmentation can be a simple yet powerful way to enhance long-term prediction, even without complex architectures."}

To reduce overhead and improve exploration, prior work introduces tree structured rollouts, which share reasoning prefixes and branch at key nodes to improve sampling efficiency. However, this paradigm still faces two challenges: (1) high entropy branching can trigger rollout collapse, where the branching budget concentrates on a few trajectories with consecutive high-entropy segments, rapidly reducing the number of effective branches; (2) early pseudo-labels are noisy and biased, which can induce self-reinforcing overfitting, causing the policy to sharpen prematurely and suppress exploration. To address these issues, we propose Entropy Confidence Hybrid Group Relative Policy Optimization (ECHO). During rollout, ECHO jointly leverages local entropy and group level confidence to adaptively control branch width, and further introduces online confidence-based pruning to terminate persistently low confidence branches, avoiding high entropy traps and mitigating collapse. During policy updates, ECHO employs confidence adaptive clipping and an entropy confidence hybrid advantage shaping approach to enhance training robustness and mitigate early stage bias. Experiments demonstrate that ECHO achieves consistent gains on multiple mathematical and visual reasoning benchmarks, and generalizes more effectively under a limited rollout budget."}

Recent deep learning approaches like DeepSurv and DeepHit offer improved expressivity but sacrifice interpretability, limiting clinical adoption where trust and transparency are paramount. Hybrid models incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), such as CoxKAN, have begun to address this trade-off but remain constrained by the semi-parametric Cox framework. In this work we introduce SurvKAN, a fully parametric, time-continuous survival model based on KAN architectures that eliminates the proportional hazards constraint. SurvKAN treats time as an explicit input to a KAN that directly predicts the log-hazard function, enabling end-to-end training on the full survival likelihood. Our architecture preserves interpretability through learnable univariate functions that indicate how individual features influence risk over time.

In this paper, we propose Fat-Cat, a document-driven agent architecture that improves the signal-to-noise ratio of state management. By integrating three key components: (1) a Semantic File System that represents agent state as Markdown documents aligned with common pre-training corpora, (2) a Textual Strategy Evolution module that accumulates task-solving knowledge without parameter updates, and (3) a Closed-Loop Watcher that monitors reasoning trajectories to reduce hallucinations. Extensive reasoning, retrieval, and coding benchmarks, Fat-Cat consistently improves agent performance. It enables the Kimi-k2 model to outperform the proprietary GPT-4o baseline on HotPotQA. Replacing the document-based state with JSON leads to performance drop, while empirically validating the critical necessity of document-driven state modeling over rigid syntax.

What is missing is a principled way to consolidate explanatory information about a fixed black-box model into a persistent, auditable artefact, that accompanies the black-box throughout its life cycle. We address this gap by introducing the notion of a scientific theory of a black (SToBB). Grounded in Constructive Empiricism, a SToBB fulfils three obligations: (i) empirical adequacy with respect to all available observations of black-box behaviour, (ii) adaptability via explicit update commitments that restore adequacy when new observations arrive, and (iii) auditability through transparent documentation of assumptions, construction choices, and update behaviour. We operationalise these obligations as a general framework that specifies an extensible observation base, a traceable hypothesis class, algorithmic components for construction and revision, and documentation sufficient for third-party assessment. Explanations for concrete stakeholder needs are then obtained by querying the maintained record through interfaces, rather than by producing isolated method outputs. As a proof of concept, we instantiate a complete SToBB for a neural-network classifier on a tabular task and introduce the Constructive Box Theoriser (CoBoT) algorithm, an online procedure that constructs and maintains an empirically adequate rule-based surrogate as observations accumulate. Together, these contributions position SToBBs as a life cycle-scale, inspectable point of reference that supports consistent, reusable analyses and systematic external scrutiny."}

In particular, we introduce the frame operator $F = WW^\\top$, which gives us a spectral measure that describes how each feature allocates norm across eigenspaces. While previous tools could describe the pairwise interactions between features, spectral methods capture the global geometry (``how do all features interact?''). In toy models of superposition, we use this theory to prove that capacity saturation forces spectral localization: features collapse onto single eigenspaces, organize into tight frames, and admit discrete classification via association schemes, classifying all geometries from prior work (simplices, polygons, antiprisms). The spectral measure formalism applies to arbitrary weight matrices, enabling diagnosis of feature localization beyond toy settings. These results point toward a broader program: applying operator theory to interpretability."}

A closer examination reveals a defining Sparsity-Event Duality (SED) property of IMTS, i.e., long stretches with sparse or no observations are punctuated by short, dense bursts where most semantic events (observations) occur. However, existing Graph- and Transformer-based forecasters ignore SED: pre-alignment to uniform grids with heavy padding violates sparsity by inflating sequences and forcing computation at non-informative steps, while relational recasting weakens event semantics by disrupting local temporal continuity. These limitations motivate a more faithful and natural modeling paradigm for IMTS that aligns with its SED property. We find that Spiking Neural Networks meet this requirement, as they communicate via sparse binary spikes and update in an event-driven manner, aligning naturally with the SED nature of IMTS. Therefore, we present SEDformer, an SED-enhanced Spiking Transformer for telemetry IMTS forecasting that couples: (1) a SED-based Spike Encoder converts raw observations into event synchronous spikes using an Event-Aligned LIF neuron, (2) an Event-Preserving Temporal Downsampling module compresses long gaps while retaining salient firings and (3) a stack of SED-based Spike Transformer blocks enable intra-series dependency modeling with a membrane-based linear attention driven by EA-LIF spiking features.

In this paper, we formalize this requirement and require that, once established, semantic alignment must be preserved under temporal evolution: a constraint with no analog in static settings.

Adding entropy regularization during SFT is not a cure-all; it tends to flatten token distributions toward uniformity, increasing entropy without improving meaningful exploration capability. In this paper, we propose CurioSFT, an entropy-preserving SFT method designed to enhance exploration capabilities through intrinsic curiosity. It consists of (a) Self-Exploratory Distillation, which distills the model toward a self-generated, temperature-scaled teacher to encourage exploration within its capability; and (b) Entropy-Guided Temperature Selection, which adaptively adjusts distillation strength to mitigate knowledge forgetting by amplifying exploration at reasoning tokens while stabilizing factual tokens. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that, in SFT stage, CurioSFT outperforms the vanilla SFT by 2.5 points on in-distribution tasks and 2.9 points on out-of-distribution tasks. We also verify that exploration capabilities preserved during SFT successfully translate into concrete gains in RL stage, yielding an average improvement of 5.0 points."}

We propose an alignment-aware fine-tuning framework that integrates feedback from an external alignment signal through policy-gradient-based regularization. Our method introduces an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically balances supervised and alignment-driven gradients on a per-sample basis, prioritizing uncertain or misaligned cases while allowing well-aligned examples to follow standard supervised updates. The framework further learns abstention behavior for fully misaligned inputs, incorporating conservative responses directly into the fine-tuned model. Experiments on general and domain-specific instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate consistent reductions in harmful and hallucinated outputs without sacrificing downstream task performance.

Failing to filter these distractors causes LAMs to capture spurious correlations and build sub-optimal latent action spaces.

MaskLAM utilises segmentation masks from pretrained foundation models to weight the LAM reconstruction loss, thereby prioritising salient information over background elements while requiring no architectural modifications.

However, such detailed feedback can be unrealistic, and recent research has investigated more restricted settings such as trajectory feedback, where the agent observes all the visited state-action pairs, but only a single \\emph{aggregate} reward. In this paper, we consider a far more restrictive ``fully bandit'' feedback model for episodic MDPs, where the agent does not even observe the visited state-action pairs -- it only learns the aggregate reward. We provide the first efficient bandit learning algorithm for episodic MDPs with $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. Our regret has an exponential dependence on the horizon length $\\H$, which we show is necessary. We also obtain improved nearly-tight regret bounds for ``ordered'' MDPs; these can be used to model classical stochastic optimization problems such as $k$-item prophet inequality and sequential posted pricing.

This raises a basic question: are CFM and IFM genuinely different, or are they two descriptions of the same underlying dynamics? We show that they coincide for a natural subclass of IFM that we call forward-only IFM. Specifically, we construct a bijection between CFM and forward-only IFM.

The saddle-point dynamics of this energy perform inference and credit assignment simultaneously through local interactions. We term this framework ''Dyadic Backpropagation''. Crucially, we prove that unit-step Euler discretization, the natural timescale of layer transitions, recovers standard backpropagation exactly in precisely 2L steps for an L-layer network, with no approximations. Unlike prior energy-based methods requiring symmetric weights, asymptotic convergence, or vanishing perturbations, our framework guarantees exact gradients in finite time.

Existing methods focus on final-answer correctness, providing limited insight into how reasoning unfolds across intermediate steps. We present EvalQReason, a framework that quantifies LLM reasoning quality through step-level probability distribution analysis without requiring human annotation. The framework introduces two complementary algorithms: Consecutive Step Divergence (CSD), which measures local coherence between adjacent reasoning steps, and Step-to-Final Convergence (SFC), which assesses global alignment with final answers. Each algorithm employs five statistical metrics to capture reasoning dynamics. Experiments across mathematical and medical datasets with open-source 7B-parameter models demonstrate that CSD-based features achieve strong predictive performance for correctness classification, with classical machine learning models reaching F1=0.78 and ROC-AUC=0.82, and sequential neural models substantially improving performance (F1=0.88, ROC-AUC=0.97). CSD consistently outperforms SFC, and sequential architectures outperform classical machine learning approaches. Critically, reasoning dynamics prove domain-specific: mathematical reasoning exhibits clear divergence-based discrimination patterns between correct and incorrect solutions, while medical reasoning shows minimal discriminative signals, revealing fundamental differences in how LLMs process different reasoning types. EvalQReason enables scalable, process-aware evaluation of reasoning reliability, establishing probability-based divergence analysis as a principled approach for trustworthy AI deployment."}

ICL is strikingly sample-efficient, often learning from only a handful of demonstrations, but complex reasoning tasks typically demand many training examples to learn from. However, naively scaling ICL by adding more demonstrations breaks down at this scale: attention costs grow quadratically, performance saturates or degrades with longer contexts, and the approach remains a shallow form of learning. Due to these limitations, practitioners predominantly rely on in-weight learning (IWL) to induce reasoning. In this work, we show that by using Prefix Tuning, LLMs can learn to reason without overloading the context window and without any weight updates. We introduce $\\textbf{ReasonCACHE}$, an instantiation of this mechanism that distills demonstrations into a fixed key-value cache. Empirically, across challenging reasoning benchmarks, including GPQA-Diamond, ReasonCACHE outperforms standard ICL and matches or surpasses IWL approaches. Further, it achieves this all while being more efficient across three key axes: data, inference cost, and trainable parameters. We also theoretically prove that ReasonCACHE can be strictly more expressive than low-rank weight update since the latter ties expressivity to input rank, whereas ReasonCACHE bypasses this constraint by directly injecting key-values into the attention mechanism. Together, our findings identify ReasonCACHE as a middle path between in-context and in-weight learning, providing a scalable algorithm for learning reasoning skills beyond the context window without modifying parameters.

This can lead to ``unlearning'', where the model degrades the probability of high-quality outputs to satisfy margin constraints, and ``formatting collapse'' caused by the over-penalization of rejected sequences. In this work, we introduce SLIME (Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement), a reference-free alignment objective designed to decouple preference learning from generation quality. SLIME incorporates a three-pronged objective: (1) an anchoring term to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses; (2) a stabilizing penalty that prevents the probabilities of rejected tokens from collapsing to zero; and (3) a dual-margin mechanism that combines hard and soft constraints for precise boundary shaping.

The factored representation is lossless when factors are conditionally independent, but sacrifices predictive fidelity otherwise, creating a tradeoff between dimensional efficiency and accuracy. We derive precise predictions about the geometric structure of activations for each, including the number of subspaces, their dimensionality, and the arrangement of context embeddings within them. We test between these hypotheses on transformers trained on synthetic processes with known latent structure. Models learn factored representations when factors are conditionally independent, and continue to favor them early in training even when noise or hidden dependencies undermine conditional independence, reflecting an inductive bias toward factoring at the cost of fidelity.

By injecting controlled synthetic uniformly random noise into otherwise clean datasets, we analyze training dynamics across model sizes ranging from 480M to 5.2B parameters. We show that noisy data indeed induces training loss divergence, and that the probability of divergence depends strongly on the noise type, amount of noise, and model scale. We further find that noise-induced divergences exhibit activation patterns distinct from those caused by high learning rates, and we provide diagnostics that differentiate these two failure modes.

A promising alternative is to leverage high-quality expert human solutions, yet naive imitation of this data fails because it is fundamentally out of distribution: expert solutions are typically didactic, containing implicit reasoning gaps intended for human readers rather than computational models. Furthermore, high-quality expert solutions are expensive, necessitating generalizable sample-efficient training methods. We propose Distribution Aligned Imitation Learning (DAIL), a two-step method that bridges the distributional gap by first transforming expert solutions into detailed, in-distribution reasoning traces and then applying a contrastive objective to focus learning on expert insights and methodologies. We find that DAIL can leverage fewer than 1000 high-quality expert solutions to achieve 10-25% pass@k gains on Qwen2.5-Instruct and Qwen3 models, improve reasoning efficiency by 2x to 4x, and enable out-of-domain generalization."}

While active learning can dramatically reduce labeling cost when annotations are expensive, early performance is frequently dominated by the initial seed set, typically chosen at random. In many applications, however, related or approximate datasets are readily available and can be leveraged to construct a better seed set. We introduce a new method for selecting the seed data set for active learning, Active-Transfer Bagging (ATBagging). ATBagging estimates the informativeness of candidate data point from a Bayesian interpretation of bagged ensemble models by comparing in-bag and out-of-bag predictive distributions from the labeled dataset, yielding an information-gain proxy. To avoid redundant selections, we impose feature-space diversity by sampling a determinantal point process (DPP) whose kernel uses Random Fourier Features and a quality-diversity factorization that incorporates the informativeness scores. This same blended method is used for selection of new data points to collect during the active learning phase. We evaluate ATBagging on four real-world datasets covering both target-transfer and feature-shift scenarios (QM9, ERA5, Forbes 2000, and Beijing PM2.5). Across seed sizes nseed = 10-100, ATBagging improves or ties early active learning and increases area under the learning-curve relative to alternative seed subset selection methodologies in almost all cases, with strongest benefits in low-data regimes. Thus, ATBagging provides a low-cost, high reward means to initiating active learning-based data collection."}

We study a hybrid perspective: \\emph{trust region continual learning} that combines generative replay with a Fisher-metric trust region constraint. We show that, under local approximations, the resulting update admits a MAML-style interpretation with a single implicit inner step: replay supplies an old-task gradient signal (query-like), while the Fisher-weighted penalty provides an efficient offline curvature shaping (support-like). This yields an emergent meta-learning property in continual learning: the model becomes an initialization that rapidly \\emph{re-converges} to prior task optima after each task transition, without explicitly optimizing a bilevel objective.

Our mechanisms can incorporate arbitrary higher-order (tensor) computations as well as arbitrary relationship structures between the input tokens, and they include the aforementioned alternatives as special cases. We then systematically study their computational complexity and representational strength, including giving new algorithms and matching complexity-theoretic lower bounds on the time complexity of computing the attention matrix exactly as well as approximately, and tightly determining which polyadic tasks they can each perform. Our results give interesting trade-offs between different desiderata for these mechanisms, including a tight relationship between how expressive a mechanism is, and how large the coefficients in the model may be so that the mechanism can be approximated in almost-linear time.\n  Notably, we give a new attention mechanism which can be computed exactly in quadratic time, and which can perform function composition for any fixed number of functions.

For responsible LLM application, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques are used to estimate a model's uncertainty about its outputs, indicating the likelihood that those outputs may be problematic. For LLM reasoning tasks, it is essential to estimate the uncertainty not only for the final answer, but also for the intermediate steps of the reasoning, as this can enable more fine-grained and targeted interventions. In this study, we explore what UQ metrics better reflect the LLM's ``intermediate uncertainty''during reasoning. Our study reveals that an LLMs' incorrect reasoning steps tend to contain tokens which are highly sensitive to the perturbations on the preceding token embeddings. In this way, incorrect (uncertain) intermediate steps can be readily identified using this sensitivity score as guidance in practice. In our experiments, we show such perturbation-based metric achieves stronger uncertainty quantification performance compared with baseline methods such as token (generation) probability and token entropy. Besides, different from approaches that rely on multiple sampling, the perturbation-based metrics offer better simplicity and efficiency."}

We empirically characterize fine-grained MoE routing and uncover an informative pattern: router scores exhibit a certain head of high-confidence experts followed by an uncertain tail of low-confidence candidates.

To obtain explicit finite-sample guarantees for the last iterate, we develop a coupling argument that compares the discrete-time process to a limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our analysis applies to algorithms driven by general noise conditions, including martingale differences and functions of ergodic Markov chains. Complementing this result, we handle the convergence rate of the Polyak-Ruppert average through a direct analysis that applies under the same general setting.\n  Assuming the driving noise satisfies a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, we show that the normalized last iterates converge to a Gaussian distribution in the $p$-Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $γ_n^{1/6}$, where $γ_n$ is the step size. Similarly, the Polyak-Ruppert average is shown to converge in the Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $n^{-1/6}$. These distributional guarantees imply high-probability concentration inequalities that improve upon those derived from moment bounds and Markov's inequality. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by considering two applications: (1) linear stochastic approximation, where we explicitly quantify the transition from heavy-tailed to Gaussian behavior of the iterates, thereby bridging the gap between recent finite-sample analyses and asymptotic theory and (2) stochastic gradient descent, where we establish rate of convergence to the central limit theorem."}

Our key insight is that while absolute information gains diminish as knowledge accumulates (making value-based RL unstable), relative comparisons between candidate interventions remain meaningful throughout. ACE exploits this via Direct Preference Optimization, learning from pairwise intervention comparisons rather than non-stationary reward magnitudes. Across synthetic benchmarks, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves 70-71% improvement over baselines at equal intervention budgets (p < 0.001, Cohen's d ~ 2). Notably, the learned policy autonomously discovers that collider mechanisms require concentrated interventions on parent variables, a theoretically-grounded strategy that emerges purely from experience.

To address these limitations, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning with conflict risk prediction, named RL CRP, to optimize client selection in multi-server FL systems. Specifically, each server estimates the likelihood of client selection conflicts using a categorical hidden Markov model based on its sparse historical client selection sequence. Then, a fairness-aware reward mechanism is incorporated to promote long-term client participation for minimizing training latency and resource contention.

Empirically, we show that naive initialization at this stage disrupts activation statistics, triggering loss spikes, while copy-based initialization introduces gradient symmetry that hinders feature diversity. To address these issues, we propose SPARKLING (balancing {S}ignal {P}reservation {A}nd symmet{R}y brea{K}ing for width-progressive {L}earn{ING}), a novel framework for mid-stage width expansion. Our method achieves signal preservation via RMS-scale consistency, stabilizing activation statistics during expansion. Symmetry breaking is ensured through asymmetric optimizer state resetting and learning rate re-warmup. Extensive experiments on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models demonstrate that, across multiple width axes and optimizer families, SPARKLING consistently outperforms training from scratch and reduces training cost by up to 35% under $2\\times$ width expansion."}

At the other extreme, distillation offers dense supervision but requires demonstrations, which are costly and difficult to scale. We study text feedback as an intermediate signal: richer than scalar rewards, yet cheaper than complete demonstrations. Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective. We provide theoretical analysis on both methods, and empirically evaluate on reasoning puzzles, competition math, and creative writing tasks. Our results show that both methods consistently outperform strong baselines across benchmarks, highlighting the potential of RL with an additional source of rich supervision at scale."}

This paper presents a rigorous benchmarking analysis comparing two prominent deployment paradigms: a lightweight, Python-based REST service using FastAPI, and a specialized, high-performance serving engine, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server. Leveraging a reference architecture for healthcare AI, we deployed a DistilBERT sentiment analysis model on Kubernetes to measure median (p50) and tail (p95) latency, as well as throughput, under controlled experimental conditions. Our results indicate a distinct trade-off. While FastAPI provides lower overhead for single-request workloads with a p50 latency of 22 ms, Triton achieves superior scalability through dynamic batching, delivering a throughput of 780 requests per second on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU, nearly double that of the baseline. Furthermore, we evaluate a hybrid architectural approach that utilizes FastAPI as a secure gateway for protected health information de-identification and Triton for backend inference.

To reduce redundancy, we select nine representative games from the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework using semantic embeddings and clustering. We compare two approaches to VGDL generation: direct code generation from observations, and a two-stage method that first infers a structural causal model (SCM) and then translates it into VGDL. Both approaches are evaluated across multiple prompting strategies and controlled context regimes, varying the amount and form of information provided to the model, from just raw gameplay observations to partial VGDL specifications. Results show that the SCM-based approach more often produces VGDL descriptions closer to the ground truth than direct generation, achieving preference win rates of up to 81\\% in blind evaluations and yielding fewer logically inconsistent rules. These learned SCMs can be used for downstream use cases such as causal reinforcement learning, interpretable agents, and procedurally generating novel but logically consistent games."}

To this end, we introduce PolarMem, a training-free Polarized Latent Graph Memory designed to ground agent reasoning in verifiable evidence. PolarMem transforms fuzzy perceptual likelihoods into discrete logical constraints through non-parametric distributional partitioning. Furthermore, it employs a polarized graph topology with orthogonal inhibitory connections to explicitly store verified negation as a primary cognitive state. At inference time, we enforce a logic-dominant retrieval paradigm, suppressing hallucinatory patterns that violate negative constraints.

We study CODI, a continuous-thought teacher-student distillation model, on strictly sequential polynomial-iteration tasks. Using logit-lens decoding, linear probes, attention analysis, and activation patching, we localize intermediate-state representations and trace their routing to the final readout. On two- and three-hop tasks, CODI forms the full set of bridge states that become decodable across latent-thought positions, while the final input follows a separate near-direct route; predictions arise via late fusion at the end-of-thought boundary. For longer hop lengths, CODI does not reliably execute a full latent rollout, instead exhibiting a partial latent reasoning path that concentrates on late intermediates and fuses them with the last input at the answer readout position. Ablations show that this partial pathway can collapse under regime shifts, including harder optimization. Overall, we delineate when CODI-style latent-CoT yields faithful iterative computation versus compressed or shortcut strategies, and highlight challenges in designing robust latent-CoT objectives for sequential reasoning."}

This paper bridges the gap between generative models and high-resolution neural simulations by introducing a scalable \\textit{Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design} framework. We identify that high-resolution generation suffers from a critical resource mismatch: the World Model is compute-bound while the Decoder is memory-bound. To address this, we propose a heterogeneous architecture that intelligently decouples these components across a cluster of AI accelerators. Our system features three core innovations: (1) an asymmetric resource allocation strategy that optimizes throughput under sequence parallelism constraints; (2) a memory-centric operator fusion scheme that minimizes off-chip bandwidth usage; and (3) a manifold-aware latent extrapolation mechanism that exploits temporal redundancy to mask latency. We validate our approach on a cluster of programmable AI accelerators, enabling real-time generation at $720 \\times 480$ resolution -- a $50\\times$ increase in pixel throughput over prior baselines. Evaluated on both continuous 3D racing and discrete 2D platformer benchmarks, our system delivers fluid 26.4 FPS and 48.3 FPS respectively, with an amortized effective latency of 2.7 ms.

However, most prior approaches operate in a bottom-up manner, iteratively adjusting the prompt based on feedback from individual problems, which can cause them to lose the global perspective.

ETGPO focuses on the global failure landscape by collecting model errors, categorizing them into a taxonomy, and augmenting the prompt with guidance targeting the most frequent failure modes.

In this paper, we identify the importance of the instruction pair used during training. Furthermore, we show that targeting specific deceptive behaviors through a human-interpretable taxonomy of deception leads to improved results on evaluation datasets. Our findings reveal that instruction pairs capture deceptive intent rather than content-specific patterns, explaining why prompt choice dominates probe performance (70.6% of variance).

In many practical settings, the graphical model remains fixed while inference must be performed repeatedly for varying evidence patterns. Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms scale to large models but rely on myopic best-improvement rule that prioritizes immediate likelihood gains and often stagnate in poor local optima. Heuristics such as Guided Local Search (GLS+) partially alleviate this limitation by modifying the search landscape, but their guidance cannot be reused effectively across multiple inference queries on the same model. We propose a neural amortization framework for improving local search in this repeated-query regime. Exploiting the fixed graph structure, we train an attention-based network to score local moves by predicting their ability to reduce Hamming distance to a near-optimal solution. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing local search procedures, using this signal to balance short-term likelihood gains with long-term promise during neighbor selection. We provide theoretical intuition linking distance-reducing move selection to improved convergence behavior, and empirically demonstrate consistent improvements over SLS and GLS+ on challenging high-treewidth benchmarks in the amortized inference setting."}

We propose ToPT, a two-stage framework that delivers spatially consistent fusion and explicit task alignment. ToPT consists of two modules: spatial-aware region embedding learning (SREL) and task-aware prompting for region embeddings (Prompt4RE). SREL employs a Graphormer-based fusion module that injects spatial priors-distance and regional centrality-as learnable attention biases to capture coherent, interpretable inter-region interactions. Prompt4RE performs task-oriented prompting: a frozen multimodal large language model (MLLM) processes task-specific templates to obtain semantic vectors, which are aligned with region embeddings via multi-head cross-attention for stable task conditioning.

In this process, the policy model analyzes execution states and selects editing actions, while the canvas executes operators and returns feedback for iterative refinement.

Despite the absence of explicit topics, model outputs cover a broad semantic space, and surprisingly, each model family exhibits strong and systematic topical preferences. GPT-OSS predominantly generates programming (27.1%) and mathematical content (24.6%), whereas Llama most frequently generates literary content (9.1%). DeepSeek often generates religious content, while Qwen frequently generates multiple-choice questions. Beyond topical preferences, we also observe differences in content specialization and depth: GPT-OSS often generates more technically advanced content (e.g., dynamic programming) compared with other models (e.g., basic Python). Furthermore, we find that the near-unconstrained generation often degenerates into repetitive phrases, revealing interesting behaviors unique to each model family.

At its core, LSTR employs a Latent Transition Transcoder (LTT) with a residual skip architecture that decouples linear manifold transport from sparse semantic updates, enabling controllable semantic resolution via explicit sparsity constraints. Extensive experiments show that LSTR preserves reasoning accuracy and compression efficiency while substantially improving interpretability over dense latent baselines. Causal interventions and trajectory analyses further demonstrate that these sparse features act as both interpretable and causally effective operators in the reasoning process."}

Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) seeks to mitigate this instability, but existing approaches face two persistent challenges. First, commonly used prompt strategies rely on static instructions that perform well on average but fail to adapt to heterogeneous queries. Second, more dynamic approaches depend on offline reward models that are fundamentally correlational, confounding prompt effectiveness with query characteristics. We propose Causal Prompt Optimization (CPO), a framework that reframes prompt design as a problem of causal estimation. CPO operates in two stages. First, it learns an offline causal reward model by applying Double Machine Learning (DML) to semantic embeddings of prompts and queries, isolating the causal effect of prompt variations from confounding query attributes. Second, it utilizes this unbiased reward signal to guide a resource-efficient search for query-specific prompts without relying on costly online evaluation. We evaluate CPO across benchmarks in mathematical reasoning, visualization, and data analytics. CPO consistently outperforms human-engineered prompts and state-of-the-art automated optimizers. The gains are driven primarily by improved robustness on hard queries, where existing methods tend to deteriorate. Beyond performance, CPO fundamentally reshapes the economics of prompt optimization: by shifting evaluation from real-time model execution to an offline causal model, it enables high-precision, per-query customization at a fraction of the inference cost required by online methods. Together, these results establish causal inference as a scalable foundation for reliable and cost-efficient prompt optimization in enterprise LLM deployments."}

We propose Model-aware Counterfactual Data based Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a new inference strategy that combines model-guided counterfactual construction with decoding. Our approach uses the Video-LLM's own feedback to identify object regions most responsible for hallucination, generating targeted counterfactual inputs at the object level rather than arbitrary frame or temporal modifications. These model-aware counterfactual data is then integrated into CD to enforce evidence-grounded token selection during decoding. Experiments on EventHallusion, MVBench, Perception-test and Video-MME show that MACD consistently reduces hallucination while maintaining or improving task accuracy across diverse Video-LLMs, including Qwen and InternVL families.

ARA operates in two stages: first, a Hacker policy discovers reward model vulnerabilities while an Auditor learns to detect exploitation from latent representations; second, Auditor-Guided RLHF (AG-RLHF) gates reward signals to penalize detected hacking, transforming reward hacking from an unobservable failure into a measurable, controllable signal. Experiments across three hacking scenarios demonstrate that ARA achieves the best alignment-utility tradeoff among all baselines: reducing sycophancy to near-SFT levels while improving helpfulness, decreasing verbosity while achieving the highest ROUGE-L, and suppressing code gaming while improving Pass@1. Beyond single-domain evaluation, we show that reward hacking, detection, and mitigation all generalize across domains -- a Hacker trained on code gaming exhibits increased sycophancy despite no reward for this behavior, and an Auditor trained on one domain effectively suppresses exploitation in others, enabling efficient multi-domain defense with a single model."}

The theory predicts a small-N operating regime of strongest non-trivial separability and clarifies how sequence length and sink similarity shape the metrics. Empirically, across LLaMA-2-7B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B, measurements closely track the theoretical envelopes: top-N selection sharpens separability, sink similarity correlates with Recall.

Classic explainable AI (XAI) methods can surface failures at a single checkpoint of a model, but they are structurally ill-suited to justify what changed internally across different checkpoints and which explanatory claims are warranted about that change. We take the position that behavioral shifts should be explained comparatively: the core target should be the intervention-induced shift between a reference model and an intervened model, rather than any single model in isolation. To this aim we formulate a Comparative XAI ($Δ$-XAI) framework with a set of desiderata to be taken into account when designing proper explaining methods.

Yet, the internal mechanisms driving these complex reasoning behaviors remain opaque. Existing interpretability approaches targeting reasoning either identify components (e.g., neurons) correlated with special textual patterns, or rely on human-annotated contrastive pairs to derive control vectors. Consequently, current methods struggle to precisely localize complex reasoning mechanisms or capture sequential influence from model internal workings to the reasoning outputs. In this paper, built on outcome-oriented and sequential-influence-aware principles, we focus on identifying components that have sequential contribution to reasoning behavior where outcomes are cumulated by long-range effects. We propose Integrated Policy Gradient (IPG), a novel framework that attributes reasoning behaviors to model's inner components by propagating compound outcome-based signals such as post reasoning accuracy backward through model inference trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves more precise localization and enables reliable modulation of reasoning behaviors (e.g., reasoning capability, reasoning strength) across diverse reasoning models."}

However, we find that current MAD methods easily suffer from discussion inconsistency, LLMs fail to reach a coherent solution, due to the misalignment between their individual contexts.In this paper, we introduce a multi-LLM context learning method (M2CL) that learns a context generator for each agent, capable of dynamically generating context instructions per discussion round via automatic information organization and refinement. Specifically, inspired by our theoretical insights on the context instruction, M2CL train the generators to control context coherence and output discrepancies via a carefully crafted self-adaptive mechanism.It enables LLMs to avoid premature convergence on majority noise and progressively reach the correct consensus. We evaluate M2CL on challenging tasks, including academic reasoning, embodied tasks, and mobile control. The results show that the performance of M2CL significantly surpasses existing methods by 20%--50%, while enjoying favorable transferability and computational efficiency."}

Recent \\emph{self-evolving} systems update memory based on interaction outcomes, but most existing evolution pipelines are developed for static train/test splits and only approximate online learning by folding static benchmarks, making them brittle under true distribution shift and continuous feedback. We introduce \\textsc{Live-Evo}, an online self-evolving memory system that learns from a stream of incoming data over time. \\textsc{Live-Evo} decouples \\emph{what happened} from \\emph{how to use it} via an Experience Bank and a Meta-Guideline Bank, compiling task-adaptive guidelines from retrieved experiences for each task. To manage memory online, \\textsc{Live-Evo} maintains experience weights and updates them from feedback: experiences that consistently help are reinforced and retrieved more often, while misleading or stale experiences are down-weighted and gradually forgotten, analogous to reinforcement and decay in human memory. On the live \\textit{Prophet Arena} benchmark over a 10-week horizon, \\textsc{Live-Evo} improves Brier score by 20.8\\% and increases market returns by 12.9\\%, while also transferring to deep-research benchmarks with consistent gains over strong baselines.

We introduce BELLA (Budget-Efficient LLM Selection via Automated skill-profiling), a framework that recommends optimal LLM selection for tasks through interpretable skill-based model selection. Standard benchmarks report aggregate metrics that obscure which specific capabilities a task requires and whether a cheaper model could suffice. BELLA addresses this gap through three stages: (1) decomposing LLM outputs and extract the granular skills required by using critic-based profiling, (2) clustering skills into structured capability matrices, and (3) multi-objective optimization to select the right models to maximize performance while respecting budget constraints. BELLA provides natural-language rationale for recommendations, providing transparency that current black-box routing systems lack. We describe the framework architecture, situate it within the landscape of LLM routing and evaluation, and discuss its application to financial reasoning as a representative domain exhibiting diverse skill requirements and cost-variation across models. Our framework enables practitioners to make principled and cost-performance trade-offs for deploying LLMs."}

This shift has sparked interest in using intermediate visualizations as a reasoning aid, akin to human mental imagery. Central to this idea is the ability to form, maintain, and manipulate visual representations in a goal-oriented manner. To evaluate and probe this capability, we develop MentisOculi, a procedural, stratified suite of multi-step reasoning problems amenable to visual solution, tuned to challenge frontier models. Evaluating visual strategies ranging from latent tokens to explicit generated imagery, we find they generally fail to improve performance. Analysis of UMMs specifically exposes a critical limitation: While they possess the textual reasoning capacity to solve a task and can sometimes generate correct visuals, they suffer from compounding generation errors and fail to leverage even ground-truth visualizations. Our findings suggest that despite their inherent appeal, visual thoughts do not yet benefit model reasoning. MentisOculi establishes the necessary foundation to analyze and close this gap across diverse model families."}
