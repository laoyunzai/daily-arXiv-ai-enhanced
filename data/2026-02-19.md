TL;DR: 针对非球形颗粒DEM模拟的挑战，本研究提出了一种新型弹簧-阻尼滚动摩擦模型，将参数简化为单一物理量"临界滚动角"，并通过DEM-CFD验证其在工业焚烧炉中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟非球形颗粒在DEM中因接触检测和旋转动力学复杂性而计算成本高昂。现有弹簧-阻尼型滚动摩擦模型需要多个需相互校准的经验参数，导致实验工作量大、参数模糊且不确定性高。

Result: 稳定性分析表明，该模型能使颗粒达到物理上一致的平衡状态而无虚假旋转振荡；通过焚烧炉系统的DEM-CFD模拟验证，证实该方法能成功重现原始颗粒系统的宏观行为。

Conclusion: 该研究通过简化参数校准过程并提高模型稳定性，显著增强了DEM在工业规模非球形颗粒模拟中的适用性。

Abstract: Simulating granular materials composed of non-spherical particles remains a major challenge in discrete element method (DEM) simulations due to the complexity of contact detection and rotational dynamics, rendering large-scale simulations computationally prohibitive. To address this limitation, rolling friction is commonly introduced as an approximation to account for particle shape effects by applying a resistive torque to spherical particles. Among existing rolling friction formulations, the spring-dashpot (S-D) type model is widely recognized for its numerical stability and realistic representation of rolling resistance. However, conventional S-D models require multiple empirical parameters that must be calibrated in an interdependent manner, leading to increased experimental effort, parameter ambiguity, and uncertainty in practical applications. To overcome these issues, this study proposes a new S-D type rolling friction model that reduces the parameter set to a single physically meaningful quantity: the critical rolling angle. Derived from theoretical considerations, this parameter characterizes the transition from static to rolling motion at particle contacts. The use of a single parameter simplifies implementation and eliminates the need for extensive calibration. Stability analysis demonstrates that the proposed model allows particles to reach a physically consistent equilibrium state without spurious rotational oscillations. For large-scale applications, the model is further integrated into a coarse-grained DEM framework. Validation using DEM-CFD simulations of an incinerator system confirms that the proposed approach successfully reproduces the macroscopic behavior of the original particle system. Overall, this study enhances the applicability of DEM for industrial-scale simulations involving non-spherical particles.

### [2] [Surrogate Modeling for Neutron Transport: A Neural Operator Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15890)
*Md Hossain Sahadath,Qiyun Cheng,Shaowu Pan,Wei Ji*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: Neural operators (DeepONet and FNO) successfully replace computationally intensive neutron transport S_N solvers as fast surrogate models, achieving <0.3% runtime with high accuracy (<135 pcm eigenvalue error) across different scattering regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutron transport computation is extremely expensive, limiting real-time applications and repeated evaluations needed for design optimization. This work aims to develop accurate, efficient, and generalizable surrogate models using neural operators to enable digital twin applications.

Method: Two neural operator architectures (DeepONet and FNO) were trained to learn mappings from anisotropic neutron sources to angular fluxes in 1D slab geometry. Three models per architecture were trained for different scattering ratios (c=0.1, 0.5, 1.0) representing various transport regimes. The surrogate models replaced the transport sweep loop in an S_N k-eigenvalue solver.

Result: FNO achieved higher predictive accuracy while DeepONet offered greater computational efficiency. Both models provided >300× speedup (<0.3% runtime of S_N solver), with performance improving as scattering ratio increased. In eigenvalue calculations, deviations were ≤135 pcm for DeepONet and ≤112 pcm for FNO, with runtime <0.1% of conventional solver on fine grids.

Conclusion: Neural operator frameworks demonstrate strong potential as accurate, efficient, and generalizable surrogates for neutron transport, enabling real-time digital twin applications and repeated evaluations for design optimization.

Abstract: This work introduces a neural operator based surrogate modeling framework for neutron transport computation. Two architectures, the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), were trained for fixed source problems to learn the mapping from anisotropic neutron sources, Q(x,μ), to the corresponding angular fluxes, ψ(x,μ), in a one-dimensional slab geometry. Three distinct models were trained for each neural operator, corresponding to different scattering ratios (c = 0.1, 0.5, & 1.0), providing insight into their performance across distinct transport regimes (absorption-dominated, moderate, and scattering-dominated). The models were subsequently evaluated on a wide range of previously unseen source configurations, demonstrating that FNO generally achieves higher predictive accuracy, while DeepONet offers greater computational efficiency. Both models offered significant speedups that become increasingly pronounced as the scattering ratio increases, requiring <0.3% of the runtime of a conventional S_N solver. The surrogate models were further incorporated into the S_N k-eigenvalue solver, replacing the computationally intensive transport sweep loop with a single forward pass. Across varying fission cross sections and spatial-angular grids, both neural operator solvers reproduced reference eigenvalues with deviations up to 135 pcm for DeepONet and 112 pcm for FNO, while reducing runtime to <0.1% of that of the S_N solver on relatively fine grids. These results demonstrate the strong potential of neural operator frameworks as accurate, efficient, and generalizable surrogates for neutron transport, paving the way for real-time digital twin applications and repeated evaluations, such as in design optimization.

TL;DR: 纪念Helfrich教授的综述：用连续弹性理论统一解释生物膜形状，揭示圆柱、球体、圆环等形状是内在几何特征，当压力、表面张力和弯曲模量满足条件时形成

Abstract: It is with great regret that Prof. Wolfgang Helfrich passed away on 28 September 2025 in Berlin. As the founder of the membrane liquid crystal model, Prof. Helfrich made outstanding contributions to membrane physics and liquid crystal display technology. This review article is written in his memory. Biomembranes, primarily composed of lipid bilayers, are not merely passive barriers but dynamic and complex materials whose shapes are governed by the principles of soft matter physics. This review explores the shape problem in biomembranes through the lens of material science and liquid crystal theory. Beginning with classical analogies to crystals and soap bubbles, it details the application of the Helfrich elastic model to explain the biconcave shape of red blood cells. The discussion extends to multi-layer systems, drawing parallels between the focal conic structures of smectic liquid crystals, the geometries of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, and the reversible transitions in peptide assemblies. Furthermore, it examines icosahedral self-assemblies and shape formation in two-dimensional lipid monolayers at air/water interfaces. At the end of the paper, we find that the shapes such as cylinders, spheres, tori, bicocave discoids and Delaunay surfaces form a group. This result is merely an intrinsic geometric feature of these shapes and is independent of the biomembrane equation. When the pressure on the membrane, surface tension, and bending modules meet certain conditions, the biomembrane will take on these shapes. The review concludes by highlighting the unifying power of continuum elastic theories in describing a vast array of membrane morphologies across biological and synthetic systems.

Abstract: Photochromic materials enable dynamic optical modulation through reversible transitions between distinct absorption states, with broad potential for smart windows, adaptive optics, and reconfigurable photonic devices. Micron-scale photochromic hybrid films present a particularly attractive platform for these applications, combining straightforward preparation with substantial optical modulation and scalability for high-volume fabrication. However, rational design of such films remains fundamentally constrained by the absence of well-defined optical constants. Unlike homogeneous thin films, micron-scale hybrid photochromic materials comprise active particles dispersed non-uniformly within polymer matrices. Conventional first-principles electromagnetic simulations face substantial computational costs and discrepancies between simulated and experimental particle distributions. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework that extracts effective optical constants directly from minimal experimental transmittance measurements. Our dual-state effective model approximates the complex inhomogeneous photochromic layer as a compressed homogeneous medium characterized by pseudo-refractive indices and pseudo-extinction coefficients for both pristine and UV-irradiated states. Through systematic optimization against experimental data from tungsten oxide-polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films, we determine wavelength-dependent pseudo-optical constants and compression ratios that enable accurate prediction of optical modulation within the tested thickness range. Our methodology establishes a framework for engineering hybrid photochromic systems and demonstrates how data-driven modeling can overcome limitations in characterizing complex nanostructured materials.

TL;DR: 在研究NbI4、Li2(CN2)和Li2O反应体系时，发现了两种新型铌氧碘化物簇合物Nb6O3I15和Nb11O6I24，它们具有独特的结构和电子性质，特别是Nb11O6I24表现出零带隙和平带特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索NbI4、Li2(CN2)和Li2O反应体系中可能形成的新型铌氧碘化物簇合物，以发现具有新颖结构和物理化学性质的功能材料。

Method: 采用NbI4、Li2(CN2)和Li2O作为反应物进行探索性合成，通过单晶X射线衍射对新化合物的结构进行表征，并利用密度泛函理论(DFT)计算分析其电子结构和性质。

Result: 成功合成并结构表征了两种新化合物：Nb6O3I15和Nb11O6I24。两者均以蝴蝶状氧帽[Nb4O]簇核为基础结构。Nb6O3I15通过两个[NbO]单元将[Nb4O]核心扩展成三维框架结构；Nb11O6I24则包含两个相互连接的[Nb4O]单元，形成手性单元并在晶体中呈现反铁电手性的六方串状堆积。DFT计算表明Nb11O6I24具有零间接带隙，且在费米能级附近存在一对三维平带。

Conclusion: 这些化合物的独特电子特征源于其螺旋状簇结构、六方串状堆积方式以及簇间电子波函数的高度离域化，暗示可能存在强关联的簇间单重态电子态，为理解簇合物中的电子关联效应提供了新平台。

Abstract: Explorative chemistry in a reaction system composed of NbI4, Li2(CN2), and Li2O has led to the discovery of a number of niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds. During this reaction, the formation of solid phases was detected alongside with gaseous phases, resulting in a range of products with cluster cores of varying shapes. After several niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds have already been identified within this reaction system, two additional compounds, Nb6O3I15 and Nb11O6I24, are discovered and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both structures are based on the butterfly-shaped, oxygen-capped niobium cluster [Nb4O], which is extended to larger cluster fragments. The [Nb4O] cluster core in Nb6O3I15 is extended by two [NbO] units to form a three-dimensional framework, and Nb11O6I24 contains two connected [Nb4O] units, which form chiral units within an antiferrochiral hexagonal packing of strings. The striking string-like character of Nb11O6I24 was investigated in terms of its electronic structure and properties. DFT calculations showed Nb11O6I24 to possess a zero indirect band gap, with a pair of 3-dimensional flat bands surrounding the Fermi level. These unusual features of the electronic band structure suggest the presence of strongly correlated inter-cluster singlet electron states, arising from the helical shape of the clusters, the hexagonal packing of the strings, and the delocalized nature of cluster electron wavefunctions.

TL;DR: HoTe₃化合物存在两种反铁磁相（垂直条纹相和倾斜条纹相），但磁性与电荷密度波之间无耦合作用，这与同类稀土碲化物不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀土碲化物RTe₃中磁性与电荷密度波（CDW）序的相互作用机制尚未被充分研究，尤其在HoTe₃中这一关联完全未知。

Method: 采用极化和非极化中子衍射技术对单晶HoTe₃进行结构分析。

Result: 发现两种反铁磁相：高温相为铁磁层间堆叠的"垂直条纹"相（qₘ₂=(0.48,0,0)），基态为反铁磁堆叠的"倾斜条纹"相（qₘ₁=(0.5,0.5,0)）；未观测到磁性与CDW的耦合现象。

Conclusion: 磁性与CDW序的耦合需依赖磁传播矢量与CDW矢量的相对取向及单离子各向异性，这为层状范德华材料中自旋-电荷有序调控提供了关键条件。

Abstract: The $R\mathrm{Te}_3$ ($R = \text{rare earth}$) family of layered van der Waals (vdW) compounds hosts coexisting magnetic and charge density wave (CDW) orders, yet the interplay between these degrees of freedom remains little explored. Combining polarized and unpolarized neutron diffraction on single-crystal $\mathrm{HoTe}_3$, we identify two distinct antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, both exhibiting a collinear $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\downarrow$ motif within individual vdW layers. The two phases are distinguished by the vdW stacking of magnetic layers: ferromagnetic (FM) stacking in the higher-temperature AFM-II phase, here termed ``vertical-stripe'', and AFM stacking in the AFM-I ground state, here termed ``tilted-stripe''; the two phases have propagation vectors $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{m2}} = (0.48, 0, 0)$ and $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{m1}} = (0.5, 0.5, 0)$, respectively. In contrast to the CDW-driven exotic magnetism in $\mathrm{DyTe}_3$, $\mathrm{TbTe}_3$, and $\mathrm{GdTe}_3$, we find no evidence for coupling between magnetism and CDW in $\mathrm{HoTe}_3$. The relative alignment between AFM and CDW propagation vectors, as well as single-ion anisotropy, are likely essential for generating coupled spin/charge orders in layered vdW systems.

Abstract: An extensive Monte Carlo study of the classical Heisenberg model on a simple cubic lattice with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions $J_n$ between the first, second, and third neighbors is performed in a broad region of $J_2 / J_1$, $J_3 / J_1$ ratios, and temperature. The character of the phase transitions is analyzed via the Binder cumulant method. The Neel temperature $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ and the frustration parameter (the ratio $f= |θ|/T_{\mathrm{N}}$, $θ$ being the Curie-Weiss temperature) are calculated. A comparison with the Tyablikov approximation is carried out. The strength of the frustration effects is explored. Possible applications to antiferromagnetic perovskites, such as CaMnO$_3$ and HgMnO$_3$, are discussed.

Abstract: The potential for topological Kondo insulating behavior in d-electron systems has attracted interest in studying the surface states of the correlated insulators FeSb2 and FeSi. While detailed studies and theoretical description of a spin-orbit coupled ferromagnetic surface state have been applied to FeSi, the magnetic properties of the surface states of FeSb2 have not been addressed. Here, we report on the surface magnetic properties of FeSb2, utilizing the surface area dependence of magnetic susceptibility to separate the surface Curie-Weiss temperature dependence from the bulk spin-gap susceptibility. We use these results to further extract the surface magnetic anisotropy of a thin, rough-surfaced single-crystal FeSb2 to compare with the observed magnetotransport anisotropy, and find good agreement between the anisotropy in the surface magnetization and surface magnetotransport. We conclude with evidence of an anomalous Hall contribution to the low-temperature surface transport.

### [9] [Entanglement negativity in decohered topological states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16597)
*Kang-Le Cai,Meng Cheng*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper studies topological entanglement signatures in mixed-state topological order under decoherence, introducing topological entanglement negativity (TEN) and topological mutual information (TMI) to probe emergent anyon theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how decoherence affects topological order by identifying universal entanglement signatures that characterize mixed-state topological phases, extending entanglement measures beyond pure states.

Method: Developed a replica field-theory framework using doubled-state construction to relate TEN/TMI to quantum dimensions of domain-wall defects; computed exact results for decohered G-graded string-net states.

Result: For Abelian topological order under strong decoherence, TMI measures total quantum dimension of emergent premodular anyon theory, while TEN detects only its modular part; exact computations validate framework for non-Abelian cases.

Conclusion: TEN and TMI serve as distinct diagnostics for mixed-state topological order: TMI captures full topological data (premodular theory), whereas TEN selectively probes modular substructures, revealing new aspects of one-form symmetry in noisy topological systems.

Abstract: We investigate universal entanglement signatures of mixed-state phases obtained by decohering pure-state topological order (TO), focusing on topological corrections to logarithmic entanglement negativity and mutual information: topological entanglement negativity (TEN) and topological mutual information (TMI). For Abelian TOs under decoherence, we develop a replica field-theory framework based on a doubled-state construction that relates TEN and TMI to the quantum dimensions of domain-wall defects between decoherence-induced topological boundary conditions, yielding general expressions in the strong-decoherence regime. We further compute TEN and TMI exactly for decohered $G$-graded string-net states, including cases with non-Abelian anyons. We interpret the results within the strong one-form-symmetry framework for mixed-state TOs: TMI probes the total quantum dimension of the emergent premodular anyon theory, whereas TEN detects only its modular part.

Motivation: 理解烧绿石磁体在磁场诱导下的量子相变，特别是半磁化平台相的微观机制，为实际材料提供理论指导

Method: 采用大规模密度矩阵重整化群（DMRG）模拟，键维度高达20,000，在64位点立方团簇上研究自旋1和3/2模型

Result: 两种模型均出现稳定的半磁化平台，平台态为16位点超胞结构（四倍晶格），与量子二聚体模型预测的"R"态不符，表明海森堡点微扰机制失效

Conclusion: 首次在非微扰层面刻画了烧绿石磁体的场致相变，揭示了强关联效应的主导作用，为自旋1/3/2材料实验提供关键预测依据

Abstract: We use large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations with bond dimensions up to $20\ 000$ to determine the magnetization curves of spin-1 and spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnets. Both models exhibit a robust half-magnetization plateau, and we find that the same 16-site state (quadrupled unit cell) is selected in both cases on the largest 64-site cubic cluster we consider for the plateau state. This contrasts sharply with the effective quantum dimer model prediction which favors the ``R'' state, and demonstrates the breakdown of the perturbative mechanism at the Heisenberg point. These results provide a nonperturbative characterization of field-induced phases in pyrochlore magnets and predictive guidance for spin-1 and spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ materials.

Abstract: Ab initio auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is a systematically improvable many-body method, but its application to extended solids has been severely limited by unfavorable computational scaling and memory requirements that obstruct direct access to the thermodynamic and complete-basis-set limits. By combining tensor hypercontraction via interpolative separable density fitting with $\mathbf{k}$-point symmetry, we reduce the computational and memory scaling of ab initio AFQMC for solids to $O(N^3)$ and $O(N^2)$ with arbitrary basis, respectively, comparable to diffusion Monte Carlo. This enables direct and simultaneous thermodynamic-limit and complete-basis-set AFQMC calculations across insulating, metallic, and strongly correlated solids, without embedding, local approximations, empirical finite-size corrections, or composite schemes. Our results establish AFQMC as a general-purpose, systematically improvable alternative to diffusion Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster methods for predictive ab initio simulations of solids, enabling accurate energies and magnetic observables within a unified framework.

TL;DR: 本文证明公平k中心问题的3-近似比是紧的：对于任意ε>0，获得(3-ε)-近似是NP难的（假设P≠NP），现有算法已是最优，且该下界适用于两分组或每组必选一中心的极端情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公平k中心问题已有3-近似算法，但无约束k中心问题仅允许2-近似，因此是否可突破3-近似比是长期未解的理论开放问题。

Method: 通过归约方法证明：即使仅有两个分组或必须每组选一个中心（k组），获得(3-ε)-近似仍为NP难，确立了3-近似的理论下界。

Result: 3是公平k中心问题在一般度量空间中的最优近似比，该下界在双分组和单中心分组约束下均成立，且与k-供应商问题（两种版本均存在3-近似）存在本质差异。

Conclusion: 现有3-近似算法已达到理论最优，公平约束显著提升了问题近似难度；该结果澄清了公平聚类问题的计算复杂性边界。

Abstract: In this work, we study the hardness of approximation of the fair $k$-center problem. Here the data points are partitioned into groups and the task is to choose a prescribed number of data points from each group, called centers, while minimizing the maximum distance from any point to its closest center. Although a polynomial-time $3$-approximation is known for this problem in general metrics, it has remained open whether this approximation guarantee is tight or could be further improved, especially since the unconstrained $k$-center problem admits a polynomial-time factor-$2$ approximation. We resolve this open question by proving that, for every $ε>0$, achieving a $(3-ε)$-approximation is NP-hard, assuming $\text{P} \neq \text{NP}$.
  Our inapproximability results hold even when only two disjoint groups are present and at least one center must be chosen from each group. Further, it extends to the canonical one-per-group setting with $k$-groups (for arbitrary $k$), where exactly one center must be selected from each group. Consequently, the factor-$3$ barrier for fair $k$-center in general metric spaces is inherent, and existing $3$-approximation algorithms are optimal up to lower-order terms even in these restricted regimes. This result stands in sharp contrast to the $k$-supplier formulation, where both the unconstrained and fair variants admit factor-$3$ approximation in polynomial time.

TL;DR: 该研究通过计算精神病患者和健康对照组临床访谈语音嵌入的Lyapunov指数谱，发现词级嵌入呈现均匀收缩动力学，而回答级嵌入则表现出正Lyapunov指数和高维吸引子。这些非线性动力学不变量能有效区分精神病与健康语音，且结论在不同嵌入模型间保持稳定，为认知障碍提供了物理学启发的检测探针。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将语言产生视为高维动力学过程，探索利用非线性动力学不变量作为物理学启发的探针来检测认知障碍，特别是精神病性言语的认知紊乱特征。

Method: 从两个不同大语言模型生成词级和回答级语音嵌入，计算其Lyapunov指数谱，通过比较不同嵌入表征下的稳定性来评估结论的稳健性。

Result: 词级嵌入无正Lyapunov指数，呈均匀收缩动力学；回答级嵌入虽整体收缩但存在正指数和高维吸引子。Lyapunov指数谱能稳健区分精神病与健康语音，但在精神病组内整体无显著差异，仅最严重病例倾向于占据不同动力学状态。

Conclusion: 语音嵌入的非线性动力学不变量为认知障碍提供了稳定的物理学启发式探针，其结论在不同嵌入模型间具有稳健性，为理解认知紊乱开辟了新视角。

Abstract: We analyze speech embeddings from structured clinical interviews of psychotic patients and healthy controls by treating language production as a high-dimensional dynamical process. Lyapunov exponent (LE) spectra are computed from word-level and answer-level embeddings generated by two distinct large language models, allowing us to assess the stability of the conclusions with respect to different embedding presentations. Word-level embeddings exhibit uniformly contracting dynamics with no positive LE, while answer-level embeddings, in spite of the overall contraction, display a number of positive LEs and higher-dimensional attractors. The resulting LE spectra robustly separate psychotic from healthy speech, while differentiation within the psychotic group is not statistically significant overall, despite a tendency of the most severe cases to occupy distinct dynamical regimes. These findings indicate that nonlinear dynamical invariants of speech embeddings provide a physics-inspired probe of disordered cognition whose conclusions remain stable across embedding models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升手术模拟器中软组织交互的真实感，解决现有方法在动态预测精度和人类感知一致性方面的不足，以优化外科培训效果。

Method: 1) 采用Koopman算子将非线性组织动态提升至增广状态空间实现线性预测；2) 基于韦伯-费希纳和史蒂文斯定律设计贝叶斯校准模块，根据个体感知阈值动态调整力信号。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升手术模拟的感知真实性和训练价值，为VR医学教育提供新方案，未来将探索闭环神经反馈在触觉接口中的应用。

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that combines nonlinear dynamics, perceptual psychophysics and high frequency haptic rendering to enhance realism in surgical simulation. The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods. We end by discussing the potential impact on surgical training and VR, based medical education, as well as sketching future work toward closed, loop neural feedback in haptic interfaces.

TL;DR: 本研究提出Meme回复选择任务及MaMe-Re基准数据集，揭示当前大模型在理解语境幽默方面的局限性，尤其视觉信息未能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注 meme 的静态属性，但 meme 作为对话中动态幽默回复的使用机制尚未被充分探索，存在研究空白。

Method: 构建 MaMe-Re 基准：包含10万组人类标注的日本漫画面板与社交媒体帖子配对数据（50万次标注），用于评估模型选择语境适配幽默回复的能力。

Result: 三大发现：1) 大模型初步捕捉夸张等社交线索，超越表层语义匹配；2) 视觉信息未提升性能，显示视觉理解与幽默应用存在断层；3) 模型在受控环境下匹配人类判断，但难以区分语义相近选项中的细微幽默差异。

Conclusion: 语境幽默回复选择仍是当前模型的开放挑战，需突破视觉-语言融合的瓶颈，深化对社交语境中幽默机制的理解。

Abstract: Memes are a popular element of modern web communication, used not only as static artifacts but also as interactive replies within conversations. While computational research has focused on analyzing the intrinsic properties of memes, the dynamic and contextual use of memes to create humor remains an understudied area of web science. To address this gap, we introduce the Meme Reply Selection task and present MaMe-Re (Manga Meme Reply Benchmark), a benchmark of 100,000 human-annotated pairs (500,000 total annotations from 2,325 unique annotators) consisting of openly licensed Japanese manga panels and social media posts. Our analysis reveals three key insights: (1) large language models (LLMs) show preliminary evidence of capturing complex social cues such as exaggeration, moving beyond surface-level semantic matching; (2) the inclusion of visual information does not improve performance, revealing a gap between understanding visual content and effectively using it for contextual humor; (3) while LLMs can match human judgments in controlled settings, they struggle to distinguish subtle differences in wit among semantically similar candidates. These findings suggest that selecting contextually humorous replies remains an open challenge for current models.

*Barak Or*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究混合推理系统在部分可观测和证据不匹配下的运行时稳定性问题，提出基于卡尔曼滤波思想的认知漂移监测框架，实现故障前的不稳定检测和有限时间恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合推理系统在实际部署中面临部分可观测和持续证据不匹配的挑战，其故障通常表现为内部推理动力学的逐渐发散而非孤立预测错误，但运行时行为缺乏系统性理解。

Method: 将推理过程建模为受内部创新信号驱动的随机推理过程，引入可测量的"认知漂移"现象；从可检测性、有界发散性和可恢复性角度定义稳定性；提出监控创新统计量、检测不稳定性和触发恢复机制的运行时稳定性框架。

Result: 在多步工具增强推理任务上的实验表明，该框架能在任务失败前可靠检测不稳定性，且在可恢复情况下能在有限时间内重建有界的内部行为。

Conclusion: 运行时稳定性是混合推理系统在不确定性下可靠运行的系统级要求，应被视为与任务正确性同等重要的设计原则。

Abstract: Hybrid reasoning systems that combine learned components with model-based inference are increasingly deployed in tool-augmented decision loops, yet their runtime behavior under partial observability and sustained evidence mismatch remains poorly understood. In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems from a Kalman-inspired perspective. We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms. Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time. These results emphasize runtime stability as a system-level requirement for reliable reasoning under uncertainty.

Motivation: 传统广义可加模型(GAMs)需手动配置结构，难以平衡预测精度与可解释性，自动化优化结构存在挑战

Method: 采用NSGA-II多目标遗传算法，联合优化预测误差(RMSE)和包含稀疏性/平滑度/不确定性的复杂度惩罚项

Result: 在加州房价数据集上，NSGA-II发现的模型较LinearGAMs精度更高，或精度相当但复杂度显著降低，模型更简单平滑且置信区间更窄

Conclusion: 提供了一种自动化优化透明高性能模型的通用框架，提升了GAMs的可解释性与实用性

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) balance predictive accuracy and interpretability, but manually configuring their structure is challenging. We propose using the multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II to automatically optimize GAMs, jointly minimizing prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty that captures sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty. Experiments on the California Housing dataset show that NSGA-II discovers GAMs that outperform baseline LinearGAMs in accuracy or match performance with substantially lower complexity. The resulting models are simpler, smoother, and exhibit narrower confidence intervals, enhancing interpretability. This framework provides a general approach for automated optimization of transparent, high-performing models. The code can be found at https://github.com/KaaustaaubShankar/GeneticAdditiveModels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业场景中数据增强缺乏理论指导的最优样本量(OSS)确定方法，且无评估OSS准确性的量化指标，导致效果不稳定和成本浪费

Method: 1) 基于信息论提出IT-OSE方法提供可靠OSS估计；2) 设计区间覆盖与偏差(ICD)评分直观评估OSS；3) 理论分析OSS与关键因素关系提升可解释性

Result: 1) 分类任务准确率平均提升4.38%，回归任务MAPE降低18.80%；2) ICD偏差降低49.30%；3) 计算/数据成本比穷举搜索降低83.97%/93.46%；4) 在传感器工业场景验证通用性

Conclusion: IT-OSE为工业数据增强提供理论化、可解释的OSS解决方案，兼顾性能提升与成本节约，具有工业落地价值

Abstract: In industrial scenarios, data augmentation is an effective approach to improve model performance. However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%. Furthermore, practicality experiments demonstrate that the IT-OSE exhibits generality across representative sensor-based industrial scenarios.

*Qing Yang,Yuhao Jiang,Rui Wang,Jipeng Guo,Yejiang Wang,Xinghe Cheng,Zezheng Wu,Jiapu Wang,Jingwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BamaER is a behavior-aware exercise recommendation framework that uses tri-directional hybrid encoding to capture student interactions, a dynamic memory matrix for knowledge state tracking, and Hippopotamus Optimization for diverse exercise selection, outperforming existing methods on five educational datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods only represent learning as exercise sequences, missing rich behavioral interactions and limiting long-term dependency modeling due to fixed-length segmentation, leading to biased and unreliable learning progress estimates.

Method: Proposes BamaER with three modules: (1) tri-directional hybrid encoding for heterogeneous interaction behaviors, (2) dynamic memory matrix for joint historical/current knowledge state modeling, and (3) diversity-aware optimization using Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm for candidate exercise filtering.

Result: Experiments on five real-world educational datasets demonstrate BamaER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses limitations of sequence-only modeling and fixed-length segmentation by incorporating behavioral awareness and memory augmentation, enabling more accurate and diverse personalized exercise recommendations.

Abstract: Exercise recommendation focuses on personalized exercise selection conditioned on students' learning history, personal interests, and other individualized characteristics. Despite notable progress, most existing methods represent student learning solely as exercise sequences, overlooking rich behavioral interaction information. This limited representation often leads to biased and unreliable estimates of learning progress. Moreover, fixed-length sequence segmentation limits the incorporation of early learning experiences, thereby hindering the modeling of long-term dependencies and the accurate estimation of knowledge mastery. To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage. Experiments on five real-world educational datasets show that BamaER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 传统P300脑机接口拼写器需要冗长的校准过程构建二元分类器，降低整体效率，限制了其实用性。需要开发能够在有限标注数据下有效工作的方法。

Method: 提出统一框架，采用自适应半监督期望最大化高斯混合模型（EM-GMM）算法，利用少量标注校准数据更新二元分类器，最小化校准工作量。

Result: 15名参与者中9人字符级准确率超过0.7阈值，其中7人显示自适应方法优于基准方法，在信息传输率和BCI效用指标上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该半监督学习框架为实时BCI拼写器系统提供了实用高效的替代方案，特别适用于标注数据有限的场景，显著提升拼写效率，增强辅助通信工具的可行性。

Abstract: A P300 ERP-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) speller is an assistive communication tool. It searches for the P300 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by target stimuli, distinguishing it from the neural responses to non-target stimuli embedded in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency. Thus, we proposed a unified framework with minimum calibration effort such that, given a small amount of labeled calibration data, we employed an adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm to update the binary classifier. We evaluated our method based on character-level prediction accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), and BCI utility. We applied calibration on training data and reported results on testing data. Our results indicate that, out of 15 participants, 9 participants exceed the minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7 using either on our adaptive method or the benchmark, and 7 out of these 9 participants showed that our adaptive method performed better than the benchmark. The proposed semi-supervised learning framework provides a practical and efficient alternative to improve the overall spelling efficiency in the real-time BCI speller system, particularly in contexts with limited labeled data.

Conclusion: R²Energy为安全关键电力系统的预测模型评估与开发提供了原则性基础，支撑电网在极端天气下的稳定运行。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar power, has made reliable forecasting critical for power system operations. While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity. R$^2$Energy provides a principled foundation for evaluating and developing forecasting models for safety-critical power system applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽性能优异但迭代采样导致推理延迟高。现有蒸馏技术加速采样却丢弃中间轨迹步骤，造成结构信息丢失和显著离散化误差，需要在保持密集监督的同时解决效率问题

Method: 设计多分支轨迹对齐框架：修改学生模型架构输出K倍扩展通道，每个子集对应教师模型轨迹中的离散中间步骤；通过训练这些分支同时映射到教师目标时间步的完整序列，实现密集中间轨迹对齐

Result: 学生模型能从训练最早阶段就学习导航解空间，在图像生成质量上显著优于基线蒸馏框架

Conclusion: B-DENSE通过密集轨迹对齐有效缓解了稀疏监督缺陷，为高效高质量的扩散模型生成提供了新解决方案

Abstract: Inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling. However, their iterative sampling nature results in high inference latency. While recent distillation techniques accelerate sampling, they discard intermediate trajectory steps. This sparse supervision leads to a loss of structural information and introduces significant discretization errors. To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory. By training these branches to simultaneously map to the entire sequence of the teacher's target timesteps, we enforce dense intermediate trajectory alignment. Consequently, the student model learns to navigate the solution space from the earliest stages of training, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.

Abstract: We study a type of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems in which arms with a Gaussian reward feedback are clustered. Such an arm setting finds applications in many real-world problems, for example, mmWave communications and portfolio management with risky assets, as a result of the universality of the Gaussian distribution. Based on the Thompson Sampling algorithm with Gaussian prior (TSG) algorithm for the selection of the optimal arm, we propose our Thompson Sampling with Clustered arms under Gaussian prior (TSCG) specific to the 2-level hierarchical structure. We prove that by utilizing the 2-level structure, we can achieve a lower regret bound than we do with ordinary TSG. In addition, when the reward is Unimodal, we can reach an even lower bound on the regret by our Unimodal Thompson Sampling algorithm with Clustered Arms under Gaussian prior (UTSCG). Each of our proposed algorithms are accompanied by theoretical evaluation of the upper regret bound, and our numerical experiments confirm the advantage of our proposed algorithms.

*Riccardo De Santi,Kimon Protopapas,Ya-Ping Hsieh,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Flow Expander (FE), a mirror descent algorithm that adapts pre-trained flow models using a verifier to expand sample coverage beyond training data while maintaining validity, with applications in molecular design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained flow and diffusion models are limited by their training data distribution, generating samples from only narrow regions of the feasible design space, which hinders scientific discovery applications requiring diverse, valid designs beyond observed data.

Method: The authors introduce formal definitions of strong/weak verifiers and propose global/local flow expansion frameworks via probability-space optimization. They develop Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that performs verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space.

Result: Theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees under idealized and general assumptions. Empirical evaluation shows FE successfully expands pre-trained flow models, increasing conformer diversity while preserving validity in molecular design tasks.

Conclusion: FE effectively addresses the fundamental limitation of narrow sample generation in pre-trained flow models by leveraging verifiers, enabling broader exploration of design spaces for scientific discovery applications.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models are typically pre-trained on limited available data (e.g., molecular samples), covering only a fraction of the valid design space (e.g., the full molecular space). As a consequence, they tend to generate samples from only a narrow portion of the feasible domain. This is a fundamental limitation for scientific discovery applications, where one typically aims to sample valid designs beyond the available data distribution. To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization. Then, we present Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that provably tackles both problems by verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space. Next, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, and state convergence guarantees under both idealized and general assumptions. Ultimately, we empirically evaluate our method on both illustrative, yet visually interpretable settings, and on a molecular design task showcasing the ability of FE to expand a pre-trained flow model increasing conformer diversity while preserving validity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共形预测方法假设欧氏输出空间，当响应变量位于黎曼流形（如球面）时，预测区域校准效果差，无法保证分布无关的覆盖保证

Method: 用测地线距离替代欧氏残差作为非 conformity 分数，引入交叉验证的难度估计器进行归一化处理，生成具有位置无关面积的自适应球面测地线帽预测区域

Result: 在合成球面实验和IGRF-14地磁场预报任务中，该方法显著降低条件覆盖变异性，最差覆盖更接近名义水平；而基线方法因坐标图扭曲浪费大量覆盖面积

Conclusion: 自适应测地线框架有效提升流形数据共形预测的校准性能，为球面等非欧空间回归问题提供可靠的不确定性量化工具

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage guaranties for regression; yet existing methods assume Euclidean output spaces and produce prediction regions that are poorly calibrated when responses lie on Riemannian manifolds. We propose \emph{adaptive geodesic conformal prediction}, a framework that replaces Euclidean residuals with geodesic nonconformity scores and normalizes them by a cross-validated difficulty estimator to handle heteroscedastic noise. The resulting prediction regions, geodesic caps on the sphere, have position-independent area and adapt their size to local prediction difficulty, yielding substantially more uniform conditional coverage than non-adaptive alternatives. In a synthetic sphere experiment with strong heteroscedasticity and a real-world geomagnetic field forecasting task derived from IGRF-14 satellite data, the adaptive method markedly reduces conditional coverage variability and raises worst-case coverage much closer to the nominal level, while coordinate-based baselines waste a large fraction of coverage area due to chart distortion.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) continues its rapid expansion, the environmental cost of model training and inference has become a critical societal concern. Existing benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on standard performance metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or mAP, while largely ignoring energy consumption and carbon emissions. This single-objective evaluation paradigm is increasingly misaligned with the practical requirements of large-scale deployment, particularly in energy-constrained environments such as mobile devices, developing regions, and climate-aware enterprises. In this paper, we propose AI-CARE, an evaluation tool for reporting energy consumption, and carbon emissions of ML models. In addition, we introduce the carbon-performance tradeoff curve, an interpretable tool that visualizes the Pareto frontier between performance and carbon cost. We demonstrate, through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on representative ML workloads, that carbon-aware benchmarking changes the relative ranking of models and encourages architectures that are simultaneously accurate and environmentally responsible. Our proposal aims to shift the research community toward transparent, multi-objective evaluation and align ML progress with global sustainability goals.

TL;DR: MoE-Spec solves speculative decoding slowdowns in MoE models by enforcing per-layer expert capacity limits during verification, maintaining quality while achieving 10-30% higher throughput than EAGLE-3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding's parallel token verification causes memory bottlenecks in MoE models because draft trees activate excessive unique experts, nullifying speed advantages over autoregressive decoding.

Method: Training-free expert budgeting that caps activated experts per layer during verification, prioritizing high-contribution experts while discarding rarely used ones that cause bandwidth overhead.

Result: 10-30% higher throughput than EAGLE-3 across model scales/datasets with comparable quality, plus adjustable accuracy-latency trade-offs via budget tightening.

Conclusion: Decoupling speculation depth from memory cost via expert capacity limits effectively preserves speculative decoding benefits for MoE models while enabling flexible performance-quality tuning.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by verifying multiple drafted tokens in parallel. However, for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, this parallelism introduces a severe bottleneck: large draft trees activate many unique experts, significantly increasing memory pressure and diminishing speedups from speculative decoding relative to autoregressive decoding. Prior methods reduce speculation depth when MoE verification becomes expensive. We propose MoE-Spec, a training-free verification-time expert budgeting method that decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the experts that contribute most to verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead. Experiments across multiple model scales and datasets show that this method yields 10--30\% higher throughput than state-of-the-art speculative decoding baselines (EAGLE-3) at comparable quality, with flexibility to trade accuracy for further latency reductions through tighter budgets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球超10亿人受心理健康问题影响，但护理可及性受限于人力短缺和成本。现有AI对齐方法独立优化目标，未能平衡患者偏好与临床安全。

Method: 调研335名有心理健康经历的个体，收集治疗维度偏好排序；开发基于直接偏好优化（DPO）的多目标对齐框架；针对共情、安全、积极倾听、自我激励改变、信任/默契、患者自主权六个标准训练奖励模型；系统比较多目标方法与单目标优化、监督微调及参数合并的效果。

Result: 多目标DPO（MODPO）实现更优平衡（共情77.6%，安全62.6%），而单目标优化表现失衡（共情93.6%，安全47.8%）；治疗标准比一般沟通原则高17.2%；盲评临床医生更偏好MODPO，LLM评估与临床医生间信度相当。

Conclusion: 多目标对齐框架（MODPO）能有效平衡心理健康AI系统中相互竞争的治疗目标，相比单目标方法获得更全面的性能和临床认可，为开发更安全有效的AI辅助心理健康护理铺平道路。

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect over 1 billion people worldwide, yet access to care remains limited by workforce shortages and cost constraints. While AI systems show therapeutic promise, current alignment approaches optimize objectives independently, failing to balance patient preferences with clinical safety. We survey 335 individuals with lived mental health experience to collect preference rankings across therapeutic dimensions, then develop a multi-objective alignment framework using direct preference optimization. We train reward models for six criteria -- empathy, safety, active listening, self-motivated change, trust/rapport, and patient autonomy -- and systematically compare multi-objective approaches against single-objective optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and parameter merging. Multi-objective DPO (MODPO) achieves superior balance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) compared to single-objective optimization (93.6% empathy, 47.8% safety), and therapeutic criteria outperform general communication principles by 17.2%. Blinded clinician evaluation confirms MODPO is consistently preferred, with LLM-evaluator agreement comparable to inter-clinician reliability.

TL;DR: 提出多视角张量分解框架分析铁路道口驾驶行为，发现位置比时间段更能决定行为模式，接近阶段行为最具判别性，实现基于行为相似性的道口分组以指导精准安全干预


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铁路道口存在复杂安全挑战，驾驶员行为因地点、时间和条件而异，传统方法仅单独分析单个道口，无法识别跨地点的共同行为模式

Method: 构建多视角张量分解框架：将道口行为分为接近（预警激活至闸门下降）、等待（闸门下降至列车通过）和疏散（列车通过至闸门升起）三个阶段；利用TimeSformer嵌入表示各阶段视频；构建阶段特定的相似度矩阵并应用非负对称CP分解来发现具有不同时间特征的潜在行为成分

Result: 张量分析显示：道口位置比时间段更能决定行为模式；接近阶段行为提供特别强的判别特征；学习到的成分空间可视化证实了基于位置的聚类，某些道口形成明显的行为聚类

Conclusion: 该自动化框架可跨多个道口进行可扩展的模式发现，为按行为相似性对道口进行分组提供基础，从而指导有针对性的安全干预措施

Abstract: Railway crossings present complex safety challenges where driver behavior varies by location, time, and conditions. Traditional approaches analyze crossings individually, limiting the ability to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations. We propose a multi-view tensor decomposition framework that captures behavioral similarities across three temporal phases: Approach (warning activation to gate lowering), Waiting (gates down to train passage), and Clearance (train passage to gate raising). We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions.

*Kevin Wang,Hongqian Niu,Didong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proves that generative AI models can still converge when recursively trained on mixtures of real and AI-generated data, with the convergence rate limited by the proportion of real data used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative AI models are updated regularly, they become trained on contaminated data mixtures of human-generated and AI-generated content, creating recursive training loops that cause model collapse. Existing theoretical work only covers simplified discrete or Gaussian settings, which don't reflect real-world complexity.

Method: The authors analyze recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on data distribution, treating the generative model as a universal approximator. They also extend their analysis to scenarios with sampling bias in data collection and validate findings with empirical studies.

Result: Contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. This represents the first positive theoretical result on recursive training without restrictive distributional assumptions.

Conclusion: The research provides theoretical guarantees that recursive training with data contamination is sustainable and converges, but the convergence speed is fundamentally constrained by the availability of real training data.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data. We further extend the analysis to settings where sampling bias is present in data collection and support all theoretical results with empirical studies.

TL;DR: This paper presents Omni-iEEG, a large-scale pre-surgical intracranial EEG dataset with 302 patients, 178 hours of recordings, and over 36,000 expert-validated pathological event annotations to enable reproducible and clinically translatable epilepsy research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Epilepsy affects 50 million people worldwide, with one-third suffering drug-resistant seizures where surgery is the best option. Current clinical workflows rely on labor-intensive manual review of iEEG, while existing data-driven approaches are limited by single-center datasets with inconsistent formats, lack of standardized benchmarks, and missing pathological event annotations, hindering reproducibility and clinical translation.

Method: The authors reconciled heterogeneous iEEG formats and metadata across public sources to create a harmonized large-scale dataset. They collected 302 pre-surgical patients with 178 hours of recordings, validated clinical metadata (seizure onset zones, resections, outcomes) by board-certified epileptologists, and provided over 36,000 expert-validated pathological event annotations. They defined clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics, demonstrated end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments, and explored transfer learning from non-neurophysiological domains.

Result: The Omni-iEEG dataset was successfully created with harmonized clinical metadata and expert annotations. It enables systematic evaluation of machine learning models in clinically relevant settings, demonstrates the feasibility of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments, and shows that representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains transfer effectively.

Conclusion: Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research, establishing a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research. The resource with code is publicly available at omni-ieeg.github.io/omni-ieeg.

Abstract: Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research.

### [32] [Why Any-Order Autoregressive Models Need Two-Stream Attention: A Structural-Semantic Tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16092)
*Patrick Pynadath,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates why two-stream attention works in any-order autoregressive models, discovering it addresses a deeper structural-semantic tradeoff rather than just position-content separation, with Decoupled RoPE showing competitive performance only at short sequence lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental mechanism behind two-stream attention's success in AO-ARMs, hypothesizing it serves a more subtle role than simple position-content decoupling by addressing a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation.

Method: Proposed Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content, to isolate the structural-semantic tradeoff from position-content separation.

Result: Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths where semantic and structural proximity align, but performance degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge.

Conclusion: Two-stream attention's success in AO-ARMs stems from circumventing the inherent structural-semantic tradeoff, not merely from separating position from content, revealing a fundamental challenge in any-order generation.

Abstract: Any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs) offer a promising path toward efficient masked diffusion by enabling native key-value caching, but competitive performance has so far required two-stream attention, typically motivated as a means of decoupling token content from position. In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.

Abstract: Reliable and cost-effective maintenance is essential for railway safety, particularly at the wheel-rail interface, which is prone to wear and failure. Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring.

Motivation: 现有共享表示学习方法通常同时使用所有相关数据源，但低相关性和低质量的数据源会阻碍表示学习的效果。论文关注传统上被认为"良好"的数据源集合（即各数据源对公共结构的相似相关性和质量），探究应选择哪些数据源进行联合学习。

Conclusion: 在共享表示学习中，谨慎选择数据源子集比使用全部数据更能实现最优性能，该结论为处理异构数据源提供了新视角和实用工具。

Abstract: Learning with shared representation is widely recognized as an effective way to separate commonalities from heterogeneity across various heterogeneous sources. Most existing work includes all related data sources via simultaneously training a common feature extractor and source-specific heads. It is well understood that data sources with low relevance or poor quality may hinder representation learning. In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 乘法多模态融合机制能有效提升跨被试泛化能力，频谱特征稳定性为跨被试迁移提供新思路

Abstract: Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains challenging due to individual variability in neural signals. We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了差分隐私分布鲁棒优化(DP-DRO)问题，针对非凸损失和ψ-散度，提出了DP Double-Spider和DP Recursive-Spider两种新算法，在KL散度下达到了与现有DP-ERM相匹配的效用界，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界机器学习部署面临分布偏移、群体不平衡和对抗性扰动，传统经验风险最小化(ERM)框架在这些情况下性能严重退化。分布鲁棒优化(DRO)通过优化最坏情况期望损失提供了解决方案，但DRO训练数据常包含敏感信息，需要差分隐私保护。然而由于DRO的极小极大结构和不确定性约束，DP-DRO的研究远少于DP-ERM，存在理论空白。

Method: 1) 对于一般ψ-散度：通过重构DRO为最小化问题，开发了DP Double-Spider方法；2) 对于KL散度：将问题转化为组合有限和优化问题，设计了DP Recursive-Spider方法。两种方法都针对非凸损失和有限和数据结构设计。

Result: 1) 一般ψ-散度下，DP Double-Spider达到O(1/√n + (√(d log(1/δ))/(nε))^(2/3))的梯度范数效用界；2) KL散度下，DP Recursive-Spider达到O((√(d log(1/δ))/(nε))^(2/3))，与非凸DP-ERM的最佳结果相匹配；3) 实验表明所提方法在DP极小极大优化任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该论文填补了DP-DRO研究的空白，提出了具有理论保证的高效算法，特别是在KL散度下达到了与DP-ERM相当的隐私-效用权衡，为构建隐私保护下的鲁棒学习系统提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Real-world deployments routinely face distribution shifts, group imbalances, and adversarial perturbations, under which the traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework can degrade severely.
  Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this issue by optimizing the worst-case expected loss over an uncertainty set of distributions, offering a principled approach to robustness.
  Meanwhile, as training data in DRO always involves sensitive information, safeguarding it against leakage under Differential Privacy (DP) is essential.
  In contrast to classical DP-ERM, DP-DRO has received much less attention due to its minimax optimization structure with uncertainty constraint.
  To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive study of DP-(finite-sum)-DRO with $ψ$-divergence and non-convex loss.
  First, we study DRO with general $ψ$-divergence by reformulating it as a minimization problem, and develop a novel $(\varepsilon, δ)$-DP optimization method, called DP Double-Spider, tailored to this structure.
  Under mild assumptions, we show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+ (\frac{\sqrt{d \log (1/δ)}}{n \varepsilon})^{2/3})$ in terms of the gradient norm, where $n$ denotes the data size and $d$ denotes the model dimension.
  We further improve the utility rate for specific divergences.
  In particular, for DP-DRO with KL-divergence, by transforming the problem into a compositional finite-sum optimization problem, we develop a DP Recursive-Spider method and show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}((\frac{\sqrt{d \log(1/δ)}}{n\varepsilon})^{2/3} )$, matching the best-known result for non-convex DP-ERM.
  Experimentally, we demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform existing approaches for DP minimax optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对长时程稀疏奖励场景下LLM智能体决策的挑战，现有平坦策略缺乏时间抽象，难以在整个轨迹上传播信用，导致优化不稳定和信用分配低效。

Method: 提出HiPER分层框架，将策略分解为高级规划器（提出子目标）和低级执行器（执行多步动作）。核心创新是分层优势估计（HAE），通过在规划和执行两层分配信用，聚合子目标执行的回报，提供无偏梯度估计并理论证明方差降低。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型上，HiPER在ALFWorld达到97.4%成功率，在WebShop达到83.3%，分别比最佳先前方法提升6.6%和8.3%，在需要多个依赖子任务的长时程任务上提升尤其显著。

Conclusion: 明确的分层分解对于可扩展的多轮LLM智能体强化学习训练至关重要，能够实现更高效的信用分配和稳定优化。

Abstract: Training LLMs as interactive agents for multi-turn decision-making remains challenging, particularly in long-horizon tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, where agents must execute extended sequences of actions before receiving meaningful feedback. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.
  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.
  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\% and +8.3\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks. These results highlight the importance of explicit hierarchical decomposition for scalable RL training of multi-turn LLM agents.

Conclusion: 几何紧化方法有效解决了多尺度偏微分方程PINN求解中的挑战，为复杂物理系统的模拟提供了更准确、稳定和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Several complex physical systems are governed by multi-scale partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit both smooth low-frequency components and localized high-frequency structures. Existing physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods typically train with fixed coordinate system inputs, where geometric misalignment with these structures induces gradient stiffness and ill-conditioning that hinder convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a mapping paradigm that reshapes the input coordinates through differentiable geometric compactification mappings and couples the geometric structure of PDEs with the spectral properties of residual operators. Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields more uniform residual distributions and higher solution accuracy on representative 1D and 2D PDEs, while improving training stability and convergence speed.

Abstract: Coordinating large populations of interacting agents is a central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the size of the joint state-action space scales exponentially with the number of agents. Mean-field methods alleviate this burden by aggregating agent interactions, but these approaches assume homogeneous interactions. Recent graphon-based frameworks capture heterogeneity, but are computationally expensive as the number of agents grows. Therefore, we introduce $\texttt{GMFS}$, a $\textbf{G}$raphon $\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield $\textbf{S}$ubsampling framework for scalable cooperative MARL with heterogeneous agent interactions. By subsampling $κ$ agents according to interaction strength, we approximate the graphon-weighted mean-field and learn a policy with sample complexity $\mathrm{poly}(κ)$ and optimality gap $O(1/\sqrtκ)$. We verify our theory with numerical simulations in robotic coordination, showing that $\texttt{GMFS}$ achieves near-optimal performance.

TL;DR: Proposes DSL (Discrete Stochastic Localization) training method that significantly improves the step-efficiency of masked diffusion language models by training a single SNR-invariant denoiser across continuous corruption levels, achieving 4× speedup with quality gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-autoregressive generation suffers from error accumulation and distribution shift during iterative refinement. Masked diffusion models (MDLMs) with remasking samplers like ReMDM are modern NAR approaches but face efficiency challenges in draft revision.

Method: Introduces DSL training that uses a single noise-invariant denoiser across a continuum of corruption levels, connecting intermediate draft noise and mask-style endpoint corruption within one Diffusion Transformer architecture.

Result: DSL fine-tuning yields large MAUVE improvements at low step budgets, surpasses MDLM+ReMDM baseline with ~4× fewer denoiser evaluations, and matches autoregressive quality at high step budgets on OpenWebText.

Conclusion: Training alone substantially improves MDLM/ReMDM sampling efficiency, enabling better self-correction and uncertainty calibration while making remasking significantly more compute-efficient.

Abstract: Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation reduces decoding latency by predicting many tokens in parallel, but iterative refinement often suffers from error accumulation and distribution shift under self-generated drafts. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) and their remasking samplers (e.g., ReMDM) can be viewed as modern NAR iterative refinement, where generation repeatedly revises a partially observed draft. In this work we show that \emph{training alone} can substantially improve the step-efficiency of MDLM/ReMDM sampling. We propose \textsc{DSL} (Discrete Stochastic Localization), which trains a single SNR-invariant denoiser across a continuum of corruption levels, bridging intermediate draft noise and mask-style endpoint corruption within one Diffusion Transformer. On OpenWebText, \textsc{DSL} fine-tuning yields large MAUVE gains at low step budgets, surpassing the MDLM+ReMDM baseline with \(\sim\)4$\times$ fewer denoiser evaluations, and matches autoregressive quality at high budgets. Analyses show improved self-correction and uncertainty calibration, making remasking markedly more compute-efficient.

Conclusion: 该方法通过 principled 的幾何約束機制，為提升神經算子長時預測保真度提供了可擴展的解決方案

Abstract: Neural operators offer an effective framework for learning solutions of partial differential equations for many physical systems in a resolution-invariant and data-driven manner. Existing neural operators, however, often suffer from instability in multi-layer iteration and long-horizon rollout, which stems from the unconstrained Euclidean latent space updates that violate the geometric and conservation laws. To address this challenge, we propose to constrain manifolds with low-rank Lie algebra parameterization that performs group action updates on the latent representation. Our method, termed Manifold Constraining based on Lie group (MCL), acts as an efficient \emph{plug-and-play} module that enforces geometric inductive bias to existing neural operators. Extensive experiments on various partial differential equations, such as 1-D Burgers and 2-D Navier-Stokes, over a wide range of parameters and steps demonstrate that our method effectively lowers the relative prediction error by 30-50\% at the cost of 2.26\% of parameter increase. The results show that our approach provides a scalable solution for improving long-term prediction fidelity by addressing the principled geometric constraints absent in the neural operator updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy theft causes major losses in smart grids, but centralized detection methods raise privacy concerns and are unsuitable for resource-limited smart meters.

Method: Proposed a federated learning framework using lightweight MLP models with Gaussian noise-based differential privacy injected into local model updates before aggregation.

Result: Achieved competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores on real-world dataset under both IID and non-IID distributions while preserving privacy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The solution is practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures.

Abstract: Energy theft poses a significant threat to the stability and efficiency of smart grids, leading to substantial economic losses and operational challenges. Traditional centralized machine learning approaches for theft detection require aggregating user data, raising serious concerns about privacy and data security. These issues are further exacerbated in smart meter environments, where devices are often resource-constrained and lack the capacity to run heavy models. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures.

Abstract: Deep learning has improved automated electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, but limited insight into prediction reliability hinders its use in safety-critical settings. This paper proposes UCTECG-Net, an uncertainty-aware hybrid architecture that combines one-dimensional convolutions and Transformer encoders to process raw ECG signals and their spectrograms jointly. Evaluated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB Diagnostic datasets, UCTECG-Net outperforms LSTM, CNN1D, and Transformer baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, achieving up to 98.58% accuracy on MIT-BIH and 99.14% on PTB. To assess predictive reliability, we integrate three uncertainty quantification methods (Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout) into all models and analyze their behavior using an uncertainty-aware confusion matrix and derived metrics. The results show that UCTECG-Net, particularly with Ensemble or EMCD, provides more reliable and better-aligned uncertainty estimates than competing architectures, offering a stronger basis for risk-aware ECG decision support.

Conclusion: ModalImmune通过训练阶段引入可控模态破坏机制，有效提升了多模态系统的部署鲁棒性和可靠性，为现实世界应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal systems are vulnerable to partial or complete loss of input channels at deployment, which undermines reliability in real-world settings. This paper presents ModalImmune, a training framework that enforces modality immunity by intentionally and controllably collapsing selected modality information during training so the model learns joint representations that are robust to destructive modality influence. The framework combines a spectrum-adaptive collapse regularizer, an information-gain guided controller for targeted interventions, curvature-aware gradient masking to stabilize destructive updates, and a certified Neumann-truncated hyper-gradient procedure for automatic meta-parameter adaptation. Empirical evaluation on standard multimodal benchmarks demonstrates that ModalImmune improves resilience to modality removal and corruption while retaining convergence stability and reconstruction capacity.

Abstract: Adaptation methods have been a workhorse for unlocking the transformative power of pre-trained diffusion models in diverse applications. Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction. Empirically, on D4RL offline RL benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while preserving sampling efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM公平性对齐过度关注单一敏感属性（如性别），忽略了公平性的多维性和情境依赖性，可能导致未针对性属性的偏见加剧（偏见溢出），但此现象在LLM中尚未被充分研究

Method: 使用直接偏好优化（DPO）和BBQ基准，在Mistral 7B/Llama 3.1 8B/Qwen 2.5 7B三个模型上测试性别对齐对九种敏感属性的影响，区分模糊与明确语境

Result: 总体指标显示公平性改善，但语境分析揭示：在模糊语境中外貌属性出现显著退化（p<0.001），性取向与残障状态公平性也明显下降

Conclusion: 必须建立情境感知的多属性公平性评估框架，避免单维度优化带来的系统性偏见转移

Abstract: Conventional large language model (LLM) fairness alignment largely focuses on mitigating bias along single sensitive attributes, overlooking fairness as an inherently multidimensional and context-specific value. This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) has shown promise in recent times over traditional deep learning due to its two key features: ability to learn from small sized training samples, and low compute requirements. In prior work, NL has been implemented and extensively tested on separable and time series data, and demonstrated its superior performance on both classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we investigate the next step in NL, viz., applying NL to linked data, in particular, data that is represented in the form of knowledge graphs. We integrate linked data into NL by implementing node aggregation on knowledge graphs, and then feeding the aggregated node features to the simplest NL architecture: ChaosNet. We demonstrate the results of our implementation on homophilic graph datasets as well as heterophilic graph datasets of verying heterophily. We show better efficacy of our approach on homophilic graphs than on heterophilic graphs. While doing so, we also present our analysis of the results, as well as suggestions for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative model evaluation uses high-dimensional embedding spaces, but the hubness phenomenon distorts nearest neighbor relationships and biases distance-based metrics.

Method: Extends Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure (ICDM) to create Generative ICDM (GICDM) for correcting neighborhood estimation, with a multi-scale extension for better empirical performance.

Result: Experiments show GICDM resolves hubness-induced failures, restores reliable metric behavior, and improves alignment with human judgment.

Conclusion: GICDM effectively addresses the hubness problem in generative model evaluation, providing more reliable metrics that better align with human perception.

Abstract: Generative model evaluation commonly relies on high-dimensional embedding spaces to compute distances between samples. We show that dataset representations in these spaces are affected by the hubness phenomenon, which distorts nearest neighbor relationships and biases distance-based metrics. Building on the classical Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure (ICDM), we introduce Generative ICDM (GICDM), a method to correct neighborhood estimation for both real and generated data. We introduce a multi-scale extension to improve empirical behavior. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real benchmarks demonstrate that GICDM resolves hubness-induced failures, restores reliable metric behavior, and improves alignment with human judgment.

Abstract: Analytical diffusion models offer a mathematically transparent path to generative modeling by formulating the denoising score as an empirical-Bayes posterior mean. However, this interpretability comes at a prohibitive cost: the standard formulation necessitates a full-dataset scan at every timestep, scaling linearly with dataset size. In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\bf 71 \times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines. Most notably, we demonstrate the first successful scaling of analytical diffusion to ImageNet-1K, unlocking a scalable, training-free paradigm for large-scale generative modeling.

Method: 通过系统性实验分析，揭示了参数共享程度与梯度欺骗性的关系；提出了新颖的梯度欺骗性检测算法和量化框架，用于衡量量子电路的优化难度。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for quantum machine learning in the NISQ era. While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing.

Conclusion: CALMs在预测精度与可解释性之间提供了理想的权衡，是兼具性能与透明度的有吸引力模型选择

Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAMs) offer interpretability through independent univariate feature effects but underfit when interactions are present in data. GA$^2$Ms add selected pairwise interactions which improves accuracy, but sacrifices interpretability and limits model auditing. We propose \emph{Conditionally Additive Local Models} (CALMs), a new model class, that balances the interpretability of GAMs with the accuracy of GA$^2$Ms. CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature, each active in different regions of the input space. These regions are defined independently for each feature as simple logical conditions (thresholds) on the features it interacts with. As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting. Experiments on diverse classification and regression tasks show that CALMs consistently outperform GAMs and achieve accuracy comparable with GA$^2$Ms. Overall, CALMs offer a compelling trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: This work establishes the groundwork for topologically correct multi-class surface extraction, showing promise for applications requiring complex topology preservation like geological modelling.

Abstract: Surface extraction from implicit neural representations modelling a single class surface is a well-known task. However, there exist no surface extraction methods from an implicit representation of multiple classes that guarantee topological correctness and no holes. In this work, we lay the groundwork by introducing a 2D boundary extraction algorithm for the multi-class case focusing on topological consistency and water-tightness, which also allows for setting minimum detail restraint on the approximation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using geological modelling data, showcasing its adaptiveness and ability to honour complex topology.

Method: 开发确定性LSTM模型AIFL，基于CARAVAN数据集的18,588个流域，采用两阶段训练策略：首先在1980-2019年ERA5-Land再分析数据上预训练以捕捉水文过程，然后在2016-2019年IFS控制预报数据上微调以适应业务数值天气预报的误差结构和偏差。

Result: 在2021-2024年独立时间测试集上，AIFL取得了0.66的中位修正Kling-Gupta效率系数(KGE')和0.53的中位Nash-Sutcliffe效率系数(NSE)，性能与现有全球先进系统相当，同时保持了透明可重复的驱动数据流程，在极端事件检测中表现出卓越的可靠性。

Conclusion: AIFL为水文界提供了一个精简且业务稳健的全球河流流量预测基线模型，成功解决了再分析到预报的领域偏移问题，是首个在CARAVAN生态系统中端到端训练的全球模型。

Abstract: Reliable global streamflow forecasting is essential for flood preparedness and water resource management, yet data-driven models often suffer from a performance gap when transitioning from historical reanalysis to operational forecast products. This paper introduces AIFL (Artificial Intelligence for Floods), a deterministic LSTM-based model designed for global daily streamflow forecasting. Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline. The model demonstrates exceptional reliability in extreme-event detection, providing a streamlined and operationally robust baseline for the global hydrological community.

Abstract: Bayesian quadrature is a probabilistic, model-based approach to numerical integration, the estimation of intractable integrals, or expectations. Although Bayesian quadrature was popularised already in the 1980s, no systematic and comprehensive treatment has been published. The purpose of this survey is to fill this gap. We review the mathematical foundations of Bayesian quadrature from different points of view; present a systematic taxonomy for classifying different Bayesian quadrature methods along the three axes of modelling, inference, and sampling; collect general theoretical guarantees; and provide a controlled numerical study that explores and illustrates the effect of different choices along the axes of the taxonomy. We also provide a realistic assessment of practical challenges and limitations to application of Bayesian quadrature methods and include an up-to-date and nearly exhaustive bibliography that covers not only machine learning and statistics literature but all areas of mathematics and engineering in which Bayesian quadrature or equivalent methods have seen use.

TL;DR: This paper systematically evaluates tokenization strategies for MEG data in neural foundation models, finding that simple fixed sample-level approaches perform as well as more complex learnable methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging require discretization of continuous neural time series data (tokenization), but the impact of different tokenization strategies is poorly understood.

Method: Systematic evaluation of learnable (novel autoencoder-based) vs non-learnable tokenizers on three public MEG datasets, assessing reconstruction fidelity, token prediction, biological plausibility, subject-specific information preservation, and downstream task performance.

Result: Both learnable and non-learnable tokenizers achieve high reconstruction accuracy and show broadly comparable performance across all evaluation criteria.

Conclusion: Simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies are sufficient for developing neural foundation models, reducing complexity in model design.

Abstract: Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

TL;DR: 针对平均奖励强化学习中的微分TD算法，现有收敛性分析要求与状态访问次数绑定的局部学习率时钟，这不切实际且仅限表格方法。本文证明了在标准递减学习率下，无局部时钟时任意n步的on-policy微分TD几乎必然收敛，并给出了off-policy收敛的三个充分条件，使理论更接近实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微分TD算法是平均奖励强化学习的重要进展，但现有收敛性理论要求使用与状态访问次数绑定的局部学习率时钟，这种方法既不符合实践者的使用习惯，也无法扩展到表格方法之外。

Method: 使用标准递减学习率（而非局部时钟），证明任意n步on-policy微分TD的几乎必然收敛性；进一步推导off-policy情形下收敛的三个充分条件。

Result: 证明了无局部时钟时on-policy n步微分TD对任意n都收敛；建立了off-policy n步微分TD收敛性的三个充分条件。

Conclusion: 这些结果加强了微分TD的理论基础，使其收敛性分析更贴近实际实现，解决了理论要求与实践应用之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: The average reward is a fundamental performance metric in reinforcement learning (RL) focusing on the long-run performance of an agent. Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock. These results strengthen the theoretical foundations of differential TD and bring its convergence analysis closer to practical implementations.

TL;DR: 提出APTF框架，通过分层损失函数和摊销模型动态抑制低可预测性样本，提升时间序列分析性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据易受噪声干扰且存在偏离正常分布的低可预测性样本，导致训练不稳定或陷入局部最优。现有深度学习模型较少从训练角度解决此问题。

Method: 1) 分层可预测性感知损失(HPL)动态识别低可预测性样本并逐步增加惩罚；2) 摊销模型缓解模型偏差导致的可预测性估计误差

Result: 在TSF和TSC任务中验证有效，显著提升模型对高/低可预测性样本的区分与学习能力，增强训练稳定性

Conclusion: APTF成功缓解低可预测性样本的负面影响，为时间序列分析提供鲁棒的新训练范式

Abstract: Time series data are prone to noise in various domains, and training samples may contain low-predictability patterns that deviate from the normal data distribution, leading to training instability or convergence to poor local minima. Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects of low-predictability samples is crucial for time series analysis tasks such as time series forecasting (TSF) and time series classification (TSC). While many deep learning models have achieved promising performance, few consider how to identify and penalize low-predictability samples to improve model performance from the training perspective. To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/APTF.

Conclusion: 因子化潜在动作模型能有效捕捉多实体动态，FLAM证明了分解建模在复杂场景中的优势，为可扩展可控世界模型提供了新方向

Abstract: Learning latent actions from action-free video has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling up controllable world model learning. Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.

Method: 针对可数字母的随机过程，提出相应的高概率遗憾界，并证明不可能性结果。

Result: 对于可数字母情况，获得了以至少1-δ概率成立的O(T^(-1/2)δ^(-1/2))收敛率，与现有O(T^(-1/2))期望界形式相似，并证明δ指数不可改进。

Conclusion: 通用预测的高概率遗憾界与期望界具有相似形式，且对置信参数δ的依赖关系是紧的。

Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of universal prediction of stochastic sequences with a finite time horizon $T$ known to the learner. The question we investigate is whether it is possible to derive vanishing regret bounds that hold with high probability, complementing existing bounds from the literature that hold in expectation. We propose such high-probability bounds which have a very similar form as the prior expectation bounds. For the case of universal prediction of a stochastic process over a countable alphabet, our bound states a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} δ^{-1/2})$ with probability as least $1-δ$ compared to prior known in-expectation bounds of the order $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$. We also propose an impossibility result which proves that it is not possible to improve the exponent of $δ$ in a bound of the same form without making additional assumptions.

Motivation: 解决太阳耀斑预测中类别不平衡问题，传统深度学习模型在稀有事件预测中表现有限，需优化奖励机制提升强耀斑预警能力

Method: 构建多数据集（知识特征+LOS磁图），应用CNN/CNN-BiLSTM/Transformer及CDR变体，通过特征重要性分析、奖励敏感性测试、SHAP可解释性验证和NASA/CCMC对比

Result: CDR-Transformer性能最佳：知识特征优于磁图；LOS参数中R_VALUE和AREA_ACR最有效；结合LOS与矢量磁场数据提升Transformer效果；CDR模型对奖励选择不敏感

Abstract: In this work, we develop, for the first time, a supervised classification framework with class-dependent rewards (CDR) to predict $\geq$MM flares within 24 hr. We construct multiple datasets, covering knowledge-informed features and line-of sight (LOS) magnetograms. We also apply three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and Transformer) and three CDR counterparts (CDR-CNN, CDR-CNN-BiLSTM, and CDR-Transformer). First, we analyze the importance of LOS magnetic field parameters with the Transformer, then compare its performance using LOS-only, vector-only, and combined magnetic field parameters. Second, we compare flare prediction performance based on CDR models versus deep learning counterparts. Third, we perform sensitivity analysis on reward engineering for CDR models. Fourth, we use the SHAP method for model interpretability. Finally, we conduct performance comparison between our models and NASA/CCMC. The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features. Among all models, CDR-Transformer achieves the best performance. (5)The predictive performance of the CDR models is not overly sensitive to the reward choices.(6)Through SHAP analysis, the CDR model tends to regard TOTUSJH as more important, while the Transformer tends to prioritize R_VALUE more.(7)Under identical prediction time and active region (AR) number, the CDR-Transformer shows superior predictive capabilities compared to NASA/CCMC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典在线Q学习的理论保证通常依赖乐观初始化或奖励扰动等额外机制，缺乏对这些算法本质性能的理解。本研究旨在不借助这些辅助手段的情况下，为经典Q学习建立严格的高概率遗憾界，并揭示探索机制与MDP结构之间的内在关系。

Method: 首先系统分析带衰减温度的Boltzmann探索Q学习，发现其性能对次优间隙高度敏感；进而提出结合εₙ-greedy和Boltzmann的平滑探索策略；核心创新是开发了针对具有迭代和时间依赖转移动力学的收缩马尔可夫随机逼近的高概率浓度界，其中收缩因子由混合时间控制并可渐近趋于1。

Result: 1) Boltzmann Q学习在次优间隙较大时呈次线性遗憾，间隙过小时会退化为线性增长；2) 平滑εₙ-Greedy算法实现近Õ(N^(9/10))的间隙鲁棒遗憾界；3) 建立了新颖的收缩马尔可夫随机逼近浓度界，其收缩因子允许渐近收敛至1。

Conclusion: 本研究突破了传统Q学习分析对乐观/扰动机制的依赖，首次从理论上刻画了经典算法的内在性能边界，揭示了纯Boltzmann探索的局限性，并通过混合探索策略实现了间隙鲁棒的遗憾界。所发展的浓度界工具对随机逼近理论具有独立的理论价值。

Abstract: We present the first high-probability regret bound for classical online Q-learning in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes, without relying on optimism or bonus terms. We first analyze Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and show that its regret depends critically on the suboptimality gap of the MDP: for sufficiently large gaps, the regret is sublinear, while for small gaps it deteriorates and can approach linear growth. To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $ε_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $ε_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$. To analyze these algorithms, we develop a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent transition dynamics. This bound may be of independent interest as the contraction factor in our bound is governed by the mixing time and is allowed to converge to one asymptotically.

*Adam Zweiger,Xinghong Fu,Han Guo,Yoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Attention Matching for fast latent-space context compaction, achieving 50x compression in seconds with minimal quality loss by reproducing attention outputs per KV-head.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling language models to long contexts is limited by KV cache size. Existing token-space summarization is lossy, while latent-space compaction methods (Cartridges) are too slow and expensive for practical deployment.

Method: Attention Matching constructs compact keys/values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at per-KV-head level. This formulation decomposes into simple subproblems with efficient closed-form solutions.

Result: Achieves up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss, significantly advancing the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables fast, high-quality context compaction, making long-context inference more efficient and practical for deployment.

Abstract: Scaling language models to long contexts is often bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache. In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss.

Result: 1. 证明动量优化器具有朝向对应间隔最大化问题KKT点的偏差；2. 揭示不同优化器最大化不同范数间隔（ℓ₂、ℓ_∞或混合范数）；3. 实验验证理论预测。

Conclusion: 优化器的选择决定了最大化的间隔类型，该结论将最速下降在齐次模型及线性模型中动量优化器的早期研究进行了扩展，为理解深度学习优化器的泛化能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers on homogeneous models. We first extend existing results on the implicit bias of steepest descent in homogeneous models to normalized steepest descent with an optional learning rate schedule. We then show that for smooth homogeneous models, momentum steepest descent algorithms like Muon (spectral norm), MomentumGD ($\ell_2$ norm), and Signum ($\ell_\infty$ norm) are approximate steepest descent trajectories under a decaying learning rate schedule, proving that these algorithms too have a bias towards KKT points of the corresponding margin maximization problem. We extend the analysis to Adam (without the stability constant), which maximizes the $\ell_\infty$ margin, and to Muon-Signum and Muon-Adam, which maximize a hybrid norm. Our experiments corroborate the theory and show that the identity of the margin maximized depends on the choice of optimizer. Overall, our results extend earlier lines of work on steepest descent in homogeneous models and momentum-based optimizers in linear models.

Result: 两种方法通常指向相同关键特征，但SHAP在部分案例中能提供更接近故障根本原因的信息

Conclusion: XAI方法可有效解释工业AI诊断决策，该框架具有普适性，可迁移至同类故障诊断问题

Abstract: In this work, we apply and compare two state-of-the-art eXplainability Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, the Integrated Gradients (IG) and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), that explain the fault diagnosis decisions of a highly accurate Long Short-Time Memory (LSTM) classifier. The classifier is trained to detect faults in a benchmark non-linear chemical process, the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). It is highlighted how XAI methods can help identify the subsystem of the process where the fault occurred. Using our knowledge of the process, we note that in most cases the same features are indicated as the most important for the decision, while insome cases the SHAP method seems to be more informative and closer to the root cause of the fault. Finally, since the used XAI methods are model-agnostic, the proposed approach is not limited to the specific process and can also be used in similar problems.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative concentrations of chromophores in a spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) image can reveal immense structural, functional, and molecular information about physiological processes. However, due to nonlinearities and ill-posedness inherent to sPA imaging, concentration estimation is intractable. The Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Optical Inversion Autoencoder (SPOI-AE) aims to address the sPA optical inversion and spectral unmixing problems without assuming linearity. Herein, SPOI-AE was trained and tested on \textit{in vivo} mouse lymph node sPA images with unknown ground truth chromophore concentrations. SPOI-AE better reconstructs input sPA pixels than conventional algorithms while providing biologically coherent estimates for optical parameters, chromophore concentrations, and the percent oxygen saturation of tissue. SPOI-AE's unmixing accuracy was validated using a simulated mouse lymph node phantom ground truth.

Abstract: We study reward-free and reward-agnostic exploration in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs), where an agent explores an unknown environment without observing external rewards. Reward-free exploration aims to enable $ε$-optimal policies for any reward revealed after exploration, while reward-agnostic exploration targets $ε$-optimality for rewards drawn from a small finite class. In the reward-agnostic setting, Li, Yan, Chen, and Fan achieve minimax sample complexity, but only for restrictively small accuracy parameter $ε$. We propose a new algorithm that significantly relaxes the requirement on $ε$. Our approach is novel and of technical interest by itself. Our algorithm employs an online learning procedure with carefully designed rewards to construct an exploration policy, which is used to gather data sufficient for accurate dynamics estimation and subsequent computation of an $ε$-optimal policy once the reward is revealed. Finally, we establish a tight lower bound for reward-free exploration, closing the gap between known upper and lower bounds.

Abstract: Releasing data once and for all under noninteractive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables complete data reusability, but the resulting noise may create bias in subsequent analyses. In this work, we leverage the Weierstrass transform to characterize this bias in binary classification. We prove that inverting this transform leads to a bias-correction method to compute unbiased estimates of nonlinear functions on examples released under LDP. We then build a novel stochastic gradient descent algorithm called Inverse Weierstrass Private SGD (IWP-SGD). It converges to the true population risk minimizer at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, with $n$ the number of examples. We empirically validate IWP-SGD on binary classification tasks using synthetic and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes LoRSum, a memory-efficient method that bridges the gap between SVDLoRA and standard LoRA by reformulating LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem solved via alternating least squares, matching or improving LoRA performance with minimal compute overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the performance gap between full-step low-rank projection training (SVDLoRA) and standard LoRA fine-tuning, which lacks full-matrix updates despite LoRA's parameter efficiency.

Method: Casts LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem solved with alternating least squares (proven equivalent to implicit block power method); extends to low-rank momentum and scaled variants using structured metrics (K-FAC/Shampoo) with diagonal storage for memory efficiency.

Result: Matches or outperforms LoRA baselines across synthetic tasks, CIFAR-100, and language tasks (GLUE, SQuAD v2, WikiText-103) with modest compute overhead, avoiding full SVD projections while retaining parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: LoRSum effectively closes the LoRA-SVDLoRA gap through efficient optimization, offering a practical balance between performance, memory usage, and computational cost for large model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters and memory. In this work, we address the gap between training with full steps with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning. We propose LoRSum, a memory-efficient subroutine that closes this gap for gradient descent by casting LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, which we prove to be an implicit block power method. We recover several recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as special cases, and show that LoRSum can also be used for updating a low-rank momentum. In order to address full steps with preconditioned gradient descent, we propose a scaled variant of LoRSum that uses structured metrics such as K-FAC and Shampoo, and we show that storing the diagonal of these metrics still allows them to perform well while remaining memory-efficient. Experiments on a synthetic task, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning on GLUE, SQuAD v2, and WikiText-103, show that our method can match or improve LoRA baselines given modest compute overhead, while avoiding full-matrix SVD projections and retaining LoRA-style parameter efficiency.

*Jung Min Choi,Vijaya Krishna Yalavarthi,Lars Schmidt-Thieme*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes HPMixer for long-term multivariate time series forecasting, which decouples periodic patterns (using learnable cycle module with channel-wise MLP) and residuals (using Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform with hierarchical patching), achieving competitive or SOTA performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics in long-term multivariate time series forecasting remains challenging within standard deep learning benchmark settings.

Method: HPMixer decouples periodicity and residual modeling: the periodic component uses a learnable cycle module enhanced with nonlinear channel-wise MLP; the residual component uses Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) for shift-invariant frequency-domain representations, a channel-mixing encoder for inter-channel dependencies, and a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism for multi-scale variations.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured multi-scale residual learning provides an effective framework for long-term multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: In long-term multivariate time series forecasting, effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is essential. To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.

Conclusion: 损失函数的选择需权衡指纹精度与检索目标，理论结果可指导化学数据库特性下的指纹编码设计与损失函数适配。

Abstract: One of the central challenges in the computational analysis of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data is to identify the compounds underlying the output spectra. In recent years, this problem is increasingly tackled using deep learning methods. A common strategy involves predicting a molecular fingerprint vector from an input mass spectrum, which is then used to search for matches in a chemical compound database. While various loss functions are employed in training these predictive models, their impact on model performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval. Optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions typically worsens retrieval results, and vice versa. Our theoretical analysis shows this trade-off depends on the similarity structure of candidate sets, providing guidance for loss function and fingerprint selection.

Abstract: This paper presents a capacity-constrained incentive-based demand response approach for residential smart grids. It aims to maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivising end users to reduce or shift their energy consumption. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case.

Motivation: 探索如何有效利用多个过参数化的最小二乘预训练模型进行迁移学习，特别是解决过参数化带来的偏差问题，以提升目标线性回归任务的性能

Method: 将目标学习任务建模为最小化目标数据集平方误差并惩罚与预训练模型距离的优化问题，解析推导所得目标模型的测试误差，并进行相应的实证评估

Conclusion: 提出一种简单的乘法校正因子去偏方法，可有效减少过参数化偏差，从而更好地利用多个预训练模型来学习目标预测器

Abstract: We study transfer learning for a linear regression task using several least-squares pretrained models that can be overparameterized.
  We formulate the target learning task as optimization that minimizes squared errors on the target dataset with penalty on the distance of the learned model from the pretrained models. We analytically formulate the test error of the learned target model and provide the corresponding empirical evaluations.
  Our results elucidate when using more pretrained models can improve transfer learning. Specifically, if the pretrained models are overparameterized, using sufficiently many of them is important for beneficial transfer learning. However, the learning may be compromised by overparameterization bias of pretrained models, i.e., the minimum $\ell_2$-norm solution's restriction to a small subspace spanned by the training examples in the high-dimensional parameter space. We propose a simple debiasing via multiplicative correction factor that can reduce the overparameterization bias and leverage more pretrained models to learn a target predictor.

Conclusion: 为评估和提升安全RL鲁棒性提供了实用工具，揭示了安全策略在对抗环境下的脆弱性。

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure policy performance while satisfying safety constraints. However, most existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations commonly encountered in real-world settings. In addition, existing gradient-based adversarial attacks typically require access to the policy's gradient information, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial attack framework to reveal vulnerabilities of Safe RL policies. Using expert demonstrations and black-box environment interaction, our framework learns a constraint model and a surrogate (learner) policy, enabling gradient-based attack optimization without requiring the victim policy's internal gradients or the ground-truth safety constraints. We further provide theoretical analysis establishing feasibility and deriving perturbation bounds. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under limited privileged access.

### [76] [RIDER: 3D RNA Inverse Design with Reinforcement Learning-Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16548)
*Tianmeng Hu,Yongzheng Cui,Biao Luo,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes RIDER, a reinforcement learning framework for RNA inverse design that directly optimizes 3D structural similarity rather than native sequence recovery, achieving over 100% improvement in structural fidelity and generating novel RNA sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for RNA inverse design are limited by using native sequence recovery as a surrogate metric, which doesn't guarantee correct 3D folding since different sequences can adopt similar structures.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) Pre-training a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on target 3D structures, achieving 9% better native sequence recovery than state-of-the-art; (2) Fine-tuning with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific 3D self-consistency reward functions.

Result: RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers functionally distinct RNA designs that differ from native sequences while maintaining target 3D structures.

Conclusion: Direct optimization of 3D structural similarity through reinforcement learning is superior to sequence-based proxies, enabling more effective design of functional RNAs for synthetic biology and therapeutic applications.

Abstract: The inverse design of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures is crucial for engineering functional RNAs in synthetic biology and therapeutics. While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences.

Abstract: Inference-time algorithms are an emerging paradigm in which pre-trained models are used as subroutines to solve downstream tasks. Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved.
  In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\star}(x) \propto p(x) \exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\top A x + b^\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries).

Abstract: Urban demand forecasting plays a critical role in optimizing routing, dispatching, and congestion management within Intelligent Transportation Systems. By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility. Ultimately, our methodology offers novel insights on urban micro-mobility management, helping to tackle the challenges arising from rapid urbanization and thus, contributing to more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.

*Thomas Michel,Debabrota Basu,Emilie Kaufmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops SeMI*, an optimal membership inference attack that leverages the sequence of model updates to identify training data presence, achieving stronger attacks and tighter privacy audits by avoiding the signal dilution problem inherent in static model analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI models undergo multiple updates, creating opportunities for stronger membership inference (MI) attacks and privacy audits. However, rigorous analysis of optimal MI attacks has been limited to static models with infinite samples, leaving a gap in understanding dynamic model scenarios.

Method: The authors develop SeMI*, an optimal MI attack that exploits the sequence of model updates to detect whether a target sample was inserted at a specific update step. They derive the optimal statistical power for empirical mean computation with finite samples, both with and without differential privacy mechanisms.

Result: SeMI* avoids MI signal dilution that plagues static attacks where signals weaken as training data accumulates. The attack enables adversaries to strategically tune insertion timing and canary design for more effective privacy audits. Empirical validation across various data distributions and DP-SGD-trained models shows SeMI* variants achieve significantly tighter privacy audits than existing baselines.

Conclusion: Leveraging model update sequences provides a fundamentally more powerful approach for membership inference attacks and privacy audits compared to static model analysis, with practical implications for evaluating privacy risks in real-world ML systems that undergo continuous updates.

Abstract: Modern AI models are not static. They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines.

TL;DR: This paper applies machine learning to predict graph cop numbers, finding tree-based models and GNNs achieve high accuracy by leveraging connectivity, clustering, and width parameters, offering scalable approximations for computationally difficult cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational difficulty of determining cop numbers (c(G)), the paper investigates whether machine learning can accurately predict this value from graph structural properties and identify the most influential features.

Method: The study compares classical machine learning methods (particularly tree-based models) with graph neural networks, evaluating their prediction accuracy and performing interpretability analysis to identify key structural properties.

Result: Tree-based models achieve high accuracy despite class imbalance, while GNNs perform comparably without explicit feature engineering. Key predictive features include node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, aligning with theoretical results.

Conclusion: Machine learning approaches can effectively complement existing cop number algorithms by providing scalable approximations where direct computation is infeasible.

Abstract: Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.

*Jim Zhao,Tin Sum Cheng,Wojciech Masarczyk,Aurelien Lucchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper challenges the assumption that Neural Collapse (NC) is universal across optimizers. By introducing a novel metric NC0, the authors theoretically prove NC cannot emerge under AdamW's decoupled weight decay, show momentum accelerates NC in SGD, and validate findings across 3,900 experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NC research ignores the optimizer's role and assumes universal emergence, but this lacks theoretical foundation. Additionally, standard NC metrics are difficult to track and analyze theoretically, limiting understanding of what drives this phenomenon.

Method: Introduce NC0, a novel diagnostic metric whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Use NC0 to theoretically analyze three optimizer variants: SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (Adam special case), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (AdamW special case). Conduct extensive empirical validation with 3,900 training runs across diverse datasets, architectures, and hyperparameters.

Result: 1) Theoretically prove NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay (AdamW). 2) Demonstrate qualitatively different NC0 dynamics for SGD, Adam, and AdamW. 3) First result showing momentum accelerates NC (beyond just speeding convergence). 4) Empirical experiments across 3,900 runs confirm theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: This work provides the first theoretical explanation for optimizer-dependent NC emergence, revealing that weight-decay coupling critically shapes optimizer implicit biases—a previously overlooked factor that challenges the universality assumption of Neural Collapse.

Abstract: Neural Collapse (NC) refers to the emergence of highly symmetric geometric structures in the representations of deep neural networks during the terminal phase of training. Despite its prevalence, the theoretical understanding of NC remains limited. Existing analyses largely ignore the role of the optimizer, thereby suggesting that NC is universal across optimization methods. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that the choice of optimizer plays a critical role in the emergence of NC. The phenomenon is typically quantified through NC metrics, which, however, are difficult to track and analyze theoretically. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel diagnostic metric, NC0, whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Using NC0, we provide theoretical evidence that NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers, as implemented in AdamW. Concretely, we prove that SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (a special case of Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (a special case of AdamW) exhibit qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Also, we show the accelerating effect of momentum on NC (beyond convergence of train loss) when trained with SGD, being the first result concerning momentum in the context of NC. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical experiments consisting of 3,900 training runs across various datasets, architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters, confirming our theoretical results. This work provides the first theoretical explanation for optimizer-dependent emergence of NC and highlights the overlooked role of weight-decay coupling in shaping the implicit biases of optimizers.

Abstract: Matched molecular pairs (MMPs) capture the local chemical edits that medicinal chemists routinely use to design analogs, but existing ML approaches either operate at the whole-molecule level with limited edit controllability or learn MMP-style edits from restricted settings and small models. We propose a variable-to-variable formulation of analog generation and train a foundation model on large-scale MMP transformations (MMPTs) to generate diverse variables conditioned on an input variable. To enable practical control, we develop prompting mechanisms that let the users specify preferred transformation patterns during generation. We further introduce MMPT-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that uses external reference analogs as contextual guidance to steer generation and generalize from project-specific series. Experiments on general chemical corpora and patent-specific datasets demonstrate improved diversity, novelty, and controllability, and show that our method recovers realistic analog structures in practical discovery scenarios.

Result: 攻击者仅需控制ω(1)数据点就能通过删除请求重构几乎完整数据集；新定义可防御此类攻击并支持公告板、求和与统计学习等核心功能

Conclusion: 完美重训练范式存在根本性隐私缺陷，新安全定义在保障未删除数据安全的前提下实现了实用化的机器遗忘功能

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific data points from a trained model, often striving to emulate "perfect retraining", i.e., producing the model that would have been obtained had the deleted data never been included. We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $ω(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests. We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation. To address this problem, we propose a new security definition that specifically safeguards undeleted data against leakage caused by the deletion of other points. We show that our definition permits several essential functionalities, such as bulletin boards, summations, and statistical learning.

TL;DR: 主张用因果推断框架解决大模型可解释性研究中的泛化性不足和因果解释过度问题，提出基于Pearl因果层级的诊断框架以匹配证据强度与研究结论


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大模型可解释性研究存在两大缺陷：研究发现缺乏泛化性，以及因果解释超出证据支撑范围。亟需建立严谨的方法论体系确保解释结论的有效性

Method: 引入Pearl因果层级理论，区分三个认知层次：观察（建立行为与内部组件关联）、干预（通过消融/激活修补验证编辑对行为的影响）、反事实（无法验证的假设性推论）。结合因果表征学习(CRL)明确激活数据可恢复的变量及所需假设

Result: 提出诊断框架，指导研究者根据证据类型选择匹配的方法与评估标准。该框架能确保：1) 观察数据仅支持相关性结论 2) 干预实验支持因果影响推断 3) 避免对反事实场景做出无根据主张

Conclusion: 采用因果推断视角可系统提升可解释性研究质量，通过严格区分证据层级防止结论泛化，使大模型行为解释建立在可验证的科学基础之上

Abstract: Interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) has yielded important insights into model behaviour, yet recurring pitfalls persist: findings that do not generalise, and causal interpretations that outrun the evidence. Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在电子健康记录等应用中，患者队列规模有限而医学编码特征空间巨大，导致传统潜在空间模型在"不平衡体制"下估计困难；现有外部语义嵌入为这一问题提供了新的解决思路。

Method: 将列嵌入建模为语义嵌入在再生核希尔伯特空间中的光滑函数；采用半引导子空间构建（核主成分分析）与可扩展投影梯度下降的两步估计流程。

Result: 建立了估计误差界，刻画了统计误差与核投影近似误差的权衡关系；提供了非凸优化过程的局部收敛保证；模拟和真实EHR应用验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效整合外部语义信息，在不平衡体制下显著改善表示学习性能，兼具理论严谨性与计算可扩展性。

Abstract: Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: CaR是一种基于显式学习可行性精修的通用高效约束处理框架，通过联合训练和共享表示解决神经路由求解器在复杂硬约束下的效率问题。

Motivation: 神经求解器在简单路由问题上表现优异，但在处理复杂硬约束时优势不足，现有基于可行性掩码或隐式感知的方法效率低下或不适用。

Method: 提出Construct-and-Refine (CaR)框架，采用联合训练引导构造模块生成多样化高质量解，实现轻量级改进（10步而非先前5000步），并首次引入构造-改进共享表示以实现跨范式知识共享。

Conclusion: CaR为神经路由求解器提供了首个通用高效的显式约束处理方案，展示了在处理复杂约束问题上的广泛适用性和优越性。

Abstract: Neural solvers have achieved impressive progress in addressing simple routing problems, particularly excelling in computational efficiency. However, their advantages under complex constraints remain nascent, for which current constraint-handling schemes via feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness can be inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints. In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers.

Motivation: 大语言模型在自动评估中展现出优势，但其概率本质带来的输出不确定性可能影响教学决策和学生学习。现有研究多关注其他领域，缺乏对教育场景特别是自动评分中不确定性量化方法适用性和可靠性的系统性探索。

Method: 通过在多评估数据集、不同LLM家族及生成控制参数设置下，对多种不确定性量化方法进行基准测试，系统分析LLM在评分场景中的不确定性行为特征。

Result: 刻画了LLM在自动评分中的不确定性模式，评估了不同不确定性指标的优势与局限，并分析了模型架构、评估任务类型和生成解码策略等关键因素对不确定性估计的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为深入理解LLM自动评分中的不确定性特征提供了实践洞见，为未来开发更可靠、有效的感知不确定性评分系统奠定了研究基础。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of automatic assessment in education. While these systems demonstrate substantial advantages in adaptability to diverse question types and flexibility in output formats, they also introduce new challenges related to output uncertainty, stemming from the inherently probabilistic nature of LLMs. Output uncertainty is an inescapable challenge in automatic assessment, as assessment results often play a critical role in informing subsequent pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback to students or guiding instructional decisions. Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates. Our study provides actionable insights into the characteristics of uncertainty in LLM-based automatic assessment and lays the groundwork for developing more reliable and effective uncertainty-aware grading systems in the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework that trains LLMs to learn from interactive feedback rather than static data, enabling smaller models to match larger ones and achieve self-correction capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training relies on static corpora and ignores the interactive feedback loops essential for dynamic adaptation, unlike human learning which uses corrective feedback in collaborative settings.

Method: Transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions using information asymmetry, treating interactive in-context learning as a distinct trainable skill.

Result: Smaller models trained with this approach nearly match 10x larger models in multi-turn performance, show robust generalization from math to coding/puzzles/navigation, and develop enhanced in-context plasticity enabling self-correction without external teachers.

Conclusion: This paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement by converting external feedback signals into internal capabilities, making interactive learning a trainable skill rather than an emergent property.

Abstract: Adapting one's thought process based on corrective feedback is an essential ability in human learning, particularly in collaborative settings. In contrast, the current large language model training paradigm relies heavily on modeling vast, static corpora. While effective for knowledge acquisition, it overlooks the interactive feedback loops essential for models to adapt dynamically to their context. In this work, we propose a framework that treats this interactive in-context learning ability not as an emergent property, but as a distinct, trainable skill. We introduce a scalable method that transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry. We first show that current flagship models struggle to integrate corrective feedback on hard reasoning tasks. We then demonstrate that models trained with our approach dramatically improve the ability to interactively learn from language feedback. More specifically, the multi-turn performance of a smaller model nearly reaches that of a model an order of magnitude larger. We also observe robust out-of-distribution generalization: interactive training on math problems transfers to diverse domains like coding, puzzles and maze navigation. Our qualitative analysis suggests that this improvement is due to an enhanced in-context plasticity. Finally, we show that this paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement. By training the model to predict the teacher's critiques, effectively modeling the feedback environment, we convert this external signal into an internal capability, allowing the model to self-correct even without a teacher.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在物理世界交互应用（如导航、机器人）中需具备地理空间推理能力，但其GPS坐标和地理推理能力尚未被充分探索

Method: 创建GPSBench数据集（57,800样本/17项任务），在不使用工具前提下评估14个先进LLMs的几何坐标运算和地理知识推理能力

Result: 模型在真实地理推理表现优于几何计算；地理知识层级退化（国家层面强/城市层面弱）；坐标噪声鲁棒性表明真正理解而非记忆；坐标增强可提升下游任务，但微调会引发几何计算增益与地理知识退化间的权衡

Conclusion: 地理空间推理对LLMs仍是挑战，需针对性改进；发布的GPSBench数据集和代码将推动该领域研究发展

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications that interact with the physical world, such as navigation, robotics, or mapping, making robust geospatial reasoning a critical capability. Despite that, LLMs' ability to reason about GPS coordinates and real-world geography remains underexplored. We introduce GPSBench, a dataset of 57,800 samples across 17 tasks for evaluating geospatial reasoning in LLMs, spanning geometric coordinate operations (e.g., distance and bearing computation) and reasoning that integrates coordinates with world knowledge. Focusing on intrinsic model capabilities rather than tool use, we evaluate 14 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that GPS reasoning remains challenging, with substantial variation across tasks: models are generally more reliable at real-world geographic reasoning than at geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically, with strong country-level performance but weak city-level localization, while robustness to coordinate noise suggests genuine coordinate understanding rather than memorization. We further show that GPS-coordinate augmentation can improve in downstream geospatial tasks, and that finetuning induces trade-offs between gains in geometric computation and degradation in world knowledge.

Conclusion: 显式记忆与双重反馈通道的结合是实现持续个性化的关键，使智能体能够从新交互中高效学习并动态适应偏好变化

Abstract: Modern AI agents are powerful but often fail to align with the idiosyncratic, evolving preferences of individual users. Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts.

Abstract: Driven by our mission of "uplifting the world with memory," this paper explores the design concept of "memory" that is essential for achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI). Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed "extract then store," involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the "store then on-demand extract" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that benchmarks interactive LLM agents via scenario specification, LLM state tracking, and LLM judges, providing reliable rankings and on-policy training data without costly deterministic backends, with near-zero hallucination rates and over 90% human-judge agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic benchmarks (tau-bench, AppWorld) rely on costly deterministic backends; there's a need for benchmarks that both reliably compare models and generate on-policy training data for interactive LLM agents.

Method: Proposes Proxy State-Based Evaluation: scenarios specify user goals, facts, expected final states, and behaviors; an LLM state tracker infers structured proxy states from interaction traces; LLM judges verify goal completion and detect hallucinations.

Result: The framework produces stable, model-differentiating rankings, transferable supervision, near-zero simulator hallucination rates (per ablation), supports persona sensitivity analysis, and achieves >90% human-LLM judge agreement.

Conclusion: Proxy state-based evaluation provides a practical, scalable alternative to deterministic benchmarks for industrial LLM agents.

Abstract: Interactive large language model (LLM) agents operating via multi-turn dialogue and multi-step tool calling are increasingly used in production. Benchmarks for these agents must both reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data. Prior agentic benchmarks (e.g., tau-bench, tau2-bench, AppWorld) rely on fully deterministic backends, which are costly to build and iterate. We propose Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that preserves final state-based evaluation without a deterministic database. Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Careful scenario specification yields near-zero simulator hallucination rates as supported by ablation studies. The framework also supports sensitivity analyses over user personas. Human-LLM judge agreement exceeds 90%, indicating reliable automated evaluation. Overall, proxy state-based evaluation offers a practical, scalable alternative to deterministic agentic benchmarks for industrial LLM agents.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用序列模型的上下文学习能力来解决多智能体强化学习中的合作问题。通过让智能体在多样化的对手分布中训练，无需硬编码假设或明确的时间尺度分离，就能自然地产生合作行为。先前工作中的关键机制（易受勒索性驱动相互塑造）在此框架下自发涌现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体强化学习中，如何让自利智能体实现合作是一个根本性挑战。现有方法依赖对对手学习规则的硬编码假设，并人为区分" naive学习者"（快速更新）和"元学习者"（观察更新），这些限制影响了方法的普适性和可扩展性。

Method: 利用序列模型的上下文学习能力，在标准去中心化强化学习框架下，让智能体对抗多样化的对手分布。这种方法避免了硬编码假设和显式的时间尺度分离，使智能体能够在episode内部快速适应，形成针对对手的最佳应对策略。

Result: 训练后的序列模型智能体自然地发展出上下文最佳响应策略，在episode内部充当学习算法。先前研究中的合作机制——即易受勒索性驱动相互塑造——在此设置中自发涌现：上下文适应使智能体易受勒索，而相互塑造对手上下文学习动态的压力最终演化为合作行为。

Conclusion: 标准去中心化强化学习与序列模型结合，配合多样化的对手训练，为学习合作行为提供了一条可扩展的路径。这克服了先前方法的局限性，展示了上下文学习在实现学习感知智能体方面的强大潜力。

Abstract: Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between "learning-aware" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between "naive learners" updating on fast timescales and "meta-learners" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.

Conclusion: 该框架为实现可验证的智能体间通信迈出第一步，通过统计认证和核心守卫推理实现可证明的分歧边界控制

Abstract: Multiagent AI systems require consistent communication, but we lack methods to verify that agents share the same understanding of the terms used. Natural language is interpretable but vulnerable to semantic drift, while learned protocols are efficient but opaque. We propose a certification protocol based on the stimulus-meaning model, where agents are tested on shared observable events and terms are certified if empirical disagreement falls below a statistical threshold. In this protocol, agents restricting their reasoning to certified terms ("core-guarded reasoning") achieve provably bounded disagreement. We also outline mechanisms for detecting drift (recertification) and recovering shared vocabulary (renegotiation). In simulations with varying degrees of semantic divergence, core-guarding reduces disagreement by 72-96%. In a validation with fine-tuned language models, disagreement is reduced by 51%. Our framework provides a first step towards verifiable agent-to-agent communication.

Conclusion: 将因果结构作为软归纳先验能显著提升自动化特征工程的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Automated feature engineering (AFE) enables AI systems to autonomously construct high-utility representations from raw tabular data. However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering.

Causal Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a framework that uses symbolic reasoning to ensure correspondence between input constraints and output graphs, while offering a principled way to combine data and expertise. We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as imperfect experts for Causal ABA, eliciting semantic structural priors from variable names and descriptions and integrating them with conditional-independence evidence. Experiments on standard benchmarks and semantically grounded synthetic graphs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and we additionally introduce an evaluation protocol to mitigate memorisation bias when assessing LLMs for causal discovery.

Conclusion: FoT为构建动态高效推理方案提供可扩展基础框架，推动未来推理机制研究，代码已开源

Abstract: Prompting schemes such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, and Graph of Thoughts can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, most existing schemes require users to define static, problem-specific reasoning structures that lack adaptability to dynamic or unseen problem types. Additionally, these schemes are often under-optimized in terms of hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and prompting cost. To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT. We empirically show that FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization. We release our codebase to facilitate the development of future dynamic and efficient reasoning schemes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A seven-month workshop used iterative expert feedback to shape an LLM into a poet without retraining. The resulting AI poems were indistinguishable from human poems in a blinded test, challenging notions of creativity and authorship.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Can machines write good poetry, and what would that mean for the nature and value of art? The study seeks to answer this fundamental question about AI creativity.

Method: Conducted a seven-month poetry workshop using iterative in-context expert feedback to shape an LLM's poetic style without retraining. Performed quantitative and qualitative analyses. Conducted a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students/graduates comparing three AI poems and three poems by well-known poets.

Result: The AI developed a distinctive style and coherent corpus. In the blinded test, participants could not reliably distinguish AI from human poems (54% accuracy for human poems, 52% for AI poems, at chance level). A commercial publisher subsequently released a poetry collection authored by the AI model.

Conclusion: Workshop-style prompting effectively supports long-term creative shaping of AI, renewing debates on machine creativity and authorship.

Abstract: Can a machine write good poetry? Any positive answer raises fundamental questions about the nature and value of art. We report a seven-month poetry workshop in which a large language model was shaped into a digital poet through iterative in-context expert feedback, without retraining. Across sessions, the model developed a distinctive style and a coherent corpus, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses, and it produced a pen name and author image. In a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students and graduates (three AI poems and three poems by well-known poets each), judgments were at chance: human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52%, with 95% confidence intervals including 50%. After the workshop, a commercial publisher released a poetry collection authored by the model. These results show that workshop-style prompting can support long-horizon creative shaping and renew debates on creativity and authorship.

### [99] [Agent Skill Framework: Perspectives on the Potential of Small Language Models in Industrial Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16653)
*Yangjie Xu,Lujun Li,Lama Sleem,Niccolo Gentile,Yewei Song,Yiqun Wang,Siming Ji,Wenbo Wu,Radu State*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study investigates whether the Agent Skill framework benefits small language models (SLMs) like it does proprietary models. Results show moderately sized SLMs (12B-30B parameters) benefit substantially from Agent Skills, while tiny models struggle with skill selection. Code-specialized models at ~80B parameters match closed-source performance with better GPU efficiency, offering solutions for industrial deployment under data security and budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Agent Skill framework is widely supported by major players and performs well with proprietary models. However, it's unclear if SLMs can benefit similarly, especially in industrial scenarios where public API reliance is infeasible due to data security and budget constraints, and where SLMs show limited generalization in customized scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, then systematically evaluates language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases: two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims dataset.

Result: Tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection. Moderately sized SLMs (12B-30B parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive characterization of the capabilities and constraints of the Agent Skill framework, offering actionable insights for effective deployment of Agent Skills in SLM-centered industrial environments.

Abstract: Agent Skill framework, now widely and officially supported by major players such as GitHub Copilot, LangChain, and OpenAI, performs especially well with proprietary models by improving context engineering, reducing hallucinations, and boosting task accuracy. Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive and nuanced characterization of the capabilities and constraints of the framework, while providing actionable insights for the effective deployment of Agent Skills in SLM-centered environments.

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成扩散模型依赖可逆动力学，但打破细致平衡可能提升采样效率，需探索非可逆控制对相变动力学的影响

Method: 基于Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程分解对称/反对称动力学分量，构造指数级最优非可逆扰动，结合相变理论分析物种形成与坍缩机制

Result: 反对称分量产生旋转概率流，最优扰动提升长期弛豫速率；物种形成时间可通过非可逆扰动加速，而坍缩时间由对称分量决定且保持不变

Conclusion: 非可逆控制可定向调控生成模型的特定相变动力学（如加速物种形成），为高效采样算法设计提供新理论框架

Abstract: We show that deliberately breaking detailed balance in generative diffusion processes can accelerate the reverse process without changing the stationary distribution. Considering the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, we decompose the dynamics into a symmetric component and a non-reversible anti-symmetric component that generates rotational probability currents. We then construct an exponentially optimal non-reversible perturbation that improves the long-time relaxation rate while preserving the stationary target. We analyze how such non-reversible control reshapes the macroscopic dynamical regimes of the phase transitions recently identified in generative diffusion models. We derive a general criterion for the speciation time and show that suitable non-reversible perturbations can accelerate speciation. In contrast, the collapse transition is governed by a trace-controlled phase-space contraction mechanism that is fixed by the symmetric component, and the corresponding collapse time remains unchanged under anti-symmetric perturbations. Numerical experiments on Gaussian mixture models support these findings.

Motivation: 探索一维系统中对称性自发破缺(SSB)态在相互作用下的稳定性问题：传统理论认为1D系统的SSB态因能量密度注入而脆弱，但本研究假设相互作用可能通过守恒畴壁数机制抑制这种不稳定性，从而维持宏观量子相干性。

Method: 1. 构建具有Z2对称性破缺铁磁基态且守恒畴壁数的相互作用模型；
2. 通过局域淬火激发系统，观测磁化轮廓与散射相的关系；
3. 采用纠缠不对称性(EA)和量子Fisher信息(QFI)度量磁化涨落的量子相干性；
4. 分析光锥尺度子系统的宏观量子效应。

Result: 1. 局域淬火放大量子干涉，产生直接反映模型散射相的宏观磁化轮廓；
2. 在光锥尺度子系统中，EA和QFI证实整个扰动区域存在宏观量子相干性；
3. 将纯态的方差/EA不等式推广至混合态的QFI/EA不等式，建立两者关联。

Conclusion: 相互作用通过守恒畴壁数机制使1D系统的SSB态产生稳定宏观量子效应：局域扰动非但不破坏对称性破缺，反而激发全域量子相干，且QFI/EA不等式为混合态量子相干性提供了新度量框架，挑战了1D SSB脆弱性的传统认知。

Abstract: In one-dimensional systems, spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) states are fragile by nature, as the injection of a non-zero energy density above the ground state is expected to restore the symmetry. This instability implies that local perturbations can lead to macroscopic correlation profiles, a breaking of clustering properties and even macroscopic quantum superpositions. In this work, we investigate the effect of interaction on this phenomenology by considering an interacting model with conserved domain wall number, that possesses a ferromagnetic ground state breaking the Z2 symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We first show that a local quench in this system amplifies quantum interferences, producing a macroscopic magnetisation profile that directly reflects the scattering phase of the model. Then, we use two asymmetry measures, namely the Entanglement Asymmetry (EA) and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), to characterise the quantum coherence associated with the fluctuations of the magnetisation. By focusing on subsystems comparable in size to the light-cone of the perturbation, we confirm the emergence of macroscopic quantum coherence throughout the whole perturbed region. Finally, we discuss the link between EA and QFI and show that the variance/EA inequality for pure state can be generalised to a QFI/EA inequality for mixed states.

TL;DR: Introduces weighted coordination number (WCN) as an order parameter to study liquid-liquid phase separation and its connection to glass transition via interfacial coarsening dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore temperature-dependent coarsening of liquid-liquid interfaces as a possible mechanism for glass transition, requiring a robust order parameter to characterize phase separation behavior.

Method: Uses the WCN order parameter with the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones system, reconstructs gas-liquid and liquid-liquid binodal lines, performs instantaneous quenches of various density systems, and applies a Markov Network Model with interfacial information to estimate temperature-dependent viscosity.

Result: Successfully maps liquid-liquid phase separation, verifies local equilibrium through level rule and density/pressure profiles, and models the transition from phase separation to glass transition region via viscosity estimation.

Conclusion: Liquid-liquid interfacial dynamics may fundamentally underlie glass transition mechanisms, with WCN providing an effective tool for characterizing this relationship.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new order parameter called the weighted coordination number (WCN) to study the liquid-liquid (LL) phase separation, using the temperature-dependent coarsening of the LL interface as a possible mechanism for the glass transition. The well-established glass-forming Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones system is used for our studies. The gas-liquid binodal line is reconstructed using the WCNs, and the same approach is extended to study the liquid-liquid binodal line. Systems of various densities are instantaneously quenched from high to low temperatures where a liquid-liquid separation is observed. Densities and the composition of each liquid state are used to check the level rule, along with density and pressure profiles, demonstrating local equilibrium of liquid-liquid phase separation. The transition from the liquid-liquid phase separation in the supercooled region to the glass transition region is modeled by adopting a Markov Network Model to estimate the temperature dependent viscosity using liquid-liquid interfacial information from the classification.

Abstract: The calculation of thermal conductivity in insulating solids at temperatures below the Debye temperature is problematic, due to the breakdown of classical and semi-classical approaches. In this work, we present a fully quantum methodology to compute thermal conductivity based on Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations combined with the Green-Kubo linear response theory. The method is applied to crystalline argon modeled by a Lennard-Jones potential, a paradigmatic system where quantum effects strongly affect both thermodynamic and transport properties. From PIMC simulations, we obtain the temperature-dependent phonon frequencies, lifetimes, and specific heat. From the imaginary time correlations of the energy current, we extract the thermal transport coefficients based on a physically motivated prior. We show that the experimentally observed increase of the thermal conductivity at low temperatures cannot be explained within a standard Peierls-Boltzmann framework or quasi-harmonic approximation using phonon lifetimes alone. Instead, a distinct transport lifetime emerges from the analysis of heat-current correlations. Our results demonstrate that quantum Monte Carlo methods provide a robust, non-perturbative framework to investigate heat transport in insulating solids, beyond the limits of classical molecular dynamics and quasi-harmonic approximations.

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper investigates the topological evolution of Barabasi-Albert networks, discovering a phase transition where networks shift from trivial to complex topology. Beyond this threshold, networks exhibit self-similar growth patterns described by power-law scaling with m-dependent exponents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the homological structure and topological complexity in scale-free networks by examining how higher-order structures (simplices and holes) evolve in the Barabasi-Albert model as functions of time and attachment parameter.

Method: Numerical simulation of the Barabasi-Albert model analyzing time evolution of Δ-dimensional simplices and Betti numbers across different attachment parameters m, identifying transition points in the (Δ, m) parameter space.

Result: Discovery of a non-trivial topological transition (TT) in the (Δ, m) plane, with power-law decay in Δ-simplex increments, self-similar behavior in Betti numbers near TT, and arctangent dependence far from TT, accompanied by proposed scaling relations.

Conclusion: The BA model exhibits a rich, gapful topological transition structure where topological quantities show discrete jumps at the transition point, revealing fundamentally different topological regimes and self-similar complexity emergence.

Abstract: We examine the homological structure of the Barabasi-Albert model, focusing on the time evolution of $Δ$-dimensional simplices and topological holes as functions of time $t$ and the attachment parameter $m$ (the number of edges added by each incoming node). Numerical simulations reveal a non-trivial topological transition (TT) in the $(Δ, m)$ plane, marking a change from a topologically trivial regime to non-trivial topology. This transition signals the emergence of topological complexity in the model, where higher-order structures develop self-similarly across scales. Beyond this transition, the network exhibits self-similar topological growth, evidenced by a power-law decay in the increments of $Δ$-simplices with $m$-dependent exponents. An analogous transition occurs in the Betti numbers, which display self-similar behavior near the TT and an arctangent dependence farther from it. Based on simulation data, we propose explicit scaling relations describing the behavior of both $Δ$-simplices and Betti numbers near the TT. Overall, the analysis reveals a rich, gapful topological transition structure, where topological quantities exhibit discrete jumps at the transition point.

Conclusion: 该映射为复杂量子磁体系统的经典模拟奠定了严格理论基础，表明经典方法可高效准确预测实际材料的相变行为。

Abstract: We consider quantum-to-classical mapping for an arbitrary system of interacting spins at finite temperatures. We prove that, in the large-$S$ limit, the asymptotic form of the partition function coincides with that of a classical model for spins of length $S_C=\sqrt{S(S+1)}$. Quantum corrections to the leading term form a series in powers of $1/[S(S+1)]$. This representation provides a rigorous basis for classical modeling of realistic magnetic Hamiltonians. As an application, the classical Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compute transition temperatures for several topical materials with known interaction parameters, including MnF$_2$, MnTe, Rb$_2$MnF$_4$, MnPSe$_3$, FePS$_3$, FePSe$_3$, CoPS$_3$, CrSBr, and CrI$_3$. The resulting transition temperatures show good agreement with experimental data.

Abstract: We investigate whether the spinor field can be eliminated from the Maxwell-Dirac equations by differential algebraic methods. A generic truncated power series solution is constructed, the prolonged system of the Maxwell-Dirac electrodynamics is linearized about the solution, and the ranks of the associated coefficient matrices are computed. The results indicate that, generically, the spinor components are uniquely determined by the electromagnetic field and its derivatives. This strongly suggests that differential-algebraic elimination of the spinor field is possible.

Abstract: Approximating the dynamics given by a complex many-body Hamiltonian with a simpler effective model lies at the interface of quantum Hamiltonian learning and quantum simulation. In this context, quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been shown to outperform standard Trotter-based approximations. However, their performance is often hindered by training plateaus and local minima that become increasingly severe with system size. To overcome these limitations, we propose an entanglement-assisted learning strategy that couples a single randomly initialized auxiliary qubit to the learning system at an intermediate stage of the training process. The interplay between randomization and entanglement significantly enhances the learning performance of the protocol.

Abstract: Niobium Titanium nitride (NbTiN) based superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) are known for their high performance across a wide spectral range, from the X-ray to the mid-infrared. Nonetheless, fabrication challenges and performance degradation attributable to surface oxidation and lack of uniformity in films thinner than 5 nm remain a significant barrier for achieving high-quality detectors. In this work, we study the influence of a Silicon capping layer on film properties and on the performance of SNSPDs. A Silicon capping layer effectively suppresses oxidation and increases the superconducting transition temperature. This enables superconductivity in films as thin as 3 nm at 3 K, increases critical current in patterned nanowires and significantly extends the saturation plateau from the visible to the near infrared (up to 2050 nm): These detectors maintain sub-50 ps timing jitter, even for nanowires as wide as 250 nm and with detection areas of 20x20μm2. Our results establish that thinner films protected by a capping layer allow for the fabrication of wider wires, decreasing nanofabrication challenges and extending the operating temperature range for efficient single photon detection.

Abstract: We explore the onset of spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SW-SSB) under U(1)-symmetric (i.e., charge-conserving) open-system dynamics. We define this phenomenon for quantum states and classical probability distributions, and explore it in three complementary models, one of which exhibits nontrivial quantum coherence at short times. Our main conclusions are as follows. In one dimension, the strong symmetry is not spontaneously broken at any finite time; however, correlators probing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking develop order on length scales that grow linearly in time, parametrically faster than charge diffusion. We provide numerical evidence for this scaling in multiple distinct probes of SW-SSB, and derive it from a field-theory analysis. Moreover, we relate this scaling to the problem of inferring the charge inside a subregion by measuring its surroundings, and construct explicit decoding protocols that illustrate its origin. In two dimensions, field theory and numerical simulations support a finite-time Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like SW-SSB transition. Within continuum hydrodynamics, by contrast, SW-SSB happens at infinitesimal time in two or more dimensions. The SW-SSB transition time can thus be interpreted as marking the emergence of a continuum hydrodynamic description, or (more precisely) the timescale beyond which non-hydrodynamic information such as discrete particle worldlines can no longer be inferred. We support this picture by analyzing a model in which we exploit SW-SSB to derive a classical stochastic hydrodynamic description from the underlying quantum dynamics.

Abstract: We study a sequential coherent side-channel model in which an adversarial probe qubit interacts with a target qubit during a hidden gate sequence. Repeating the same hidden sequence for $N$ shots yields an empirical full-correlation record: the joint histogram $\widehat{P}_g(b)$ over probe bit-strings $b\in\{0,1\}^k$, which is a sufficient statistic for classical post-processing under identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.) shots but grows exponentially with circuit depth. We first describe this sequential probe framework in a coupling- and measurement-agnostic form, emphasizing the scaling of the observation space and why exact analytic distinguishability becomes intractable with circuit depth.
  We then specialize to a representative instantiation (a controlled-rotation probe coupling with fixed projective readout and a commuting $R_x$ gate alphabet) where we (i) derive a depth-dependent leakage envelope whose maximizer predicts a "Goldilocks" coupling band as a function of depth, and (ii) provide an operational decoder, via machine learning, a single parameter-conditioned map from $\widehat{P}_g$ to Alice's per-step gate labels, generalizing across coupling and noise settings without retraining. Experiments over broad coupling and noise grids show that strict sequence recovery concentrates near the predicted coupling band and degrades predictably under decoherence and finite-shot estimation.

TL;DR: 该研究利用Lights Out问题和Grover搜索算法在真实量子硬件上进行了基准测试，发现IBM Heron r2较r1有明显改进，但量子处理器性能受校准质量影响显著，且同批次设备间差异巨大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估真实量子硬件性能，比较不同厂商（IBM、IQM）和代际（Heron r1/r2）设备在实现Grover算法和Lights Out问题时的表现，并诊断设备限制因素。

Method: 在2D网格和Mobius梯图上实现Lights Out问题，使用Grover搜索算法；分别在9量子比特和16量子比特实例上测试IBM Heron r1/r2和IQM设备，并额外运行Grover SAT基线测试进行对比分析。

Result: IBM Heron r2较r1性能提升，显示2023-2024年硬件进步；IQM设备输出分布接近均匀，其中Garnet设备最可靠；同制造批次QPUs性能差异显著，校准质量对性能影响巨大。

Conclusion: 量子硬件性能持续改进但高度依赖校准，设备选择不应仅凭制造时间，需综合考虑校准状态；Lights Out问题可作为有效的量子硬件基准测试工具。

Abstract: We implement the Lights Out problem on a 2D grid and on Mobius ladder graphs and evaluate the performance of Grover's search on real quantum hardware. We use two instances using 9 and 16 qubits, and implement them on publicly available quantum hardware by IBM and IQM. Our experiments show improvements in IBM hardware between the Heron r1 and Heron r2 generations, highlighting progress in IBM hardware during the 2023-2024 period. The Lights Out circuits produced output distributions close to uniform on IQM devices. To diagnose device limitations, we additionally ran a small Grover SAT baseline, finding that IQM Garnet performs more reliably than other tested IQM devices. We also observed that QPUs of the same manufacturing revision can differ significantly in performance (a newer device is not guaranteed to be better), and that calibration has a significant impact on the performance of quantum devices, so the choice of device strongly depends on calibration quality.

Abstract: Current architectures for neutral-atom arrays utilize devices such as acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) and spatial light modulators (SLMs) to multiplex a single classical control line into N qubit control lines. Dynamic control is speed-limited by the response time of AODs, and geometrically constrained to respect a product structure, limiting motion to row-by-row or column-by-column moves. We propose an optical rastering device that can produce any 2D pattern, not limited to grids, at 1 MHz refresh rates. We demonstrate a design with a resolution of 40 x 40 that can be further scaled up to 100 x 100 to match existing and future neutral atom devices. The ability to simultaneously transport atomic qubits in arbitrary directions will enhance qubit connectivity, enable more efficient circuits, and may have broader applications ranging from LiDAR to fluorescence microscopy.

TL;DR: This paper studies how spontaneous emission in cavity array waveguides with two quantum emitters creates stable oscillating quantum states by superposing bound states inside and outside the photon continuum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics platforms are promising for exploring non-Markovian quantum phenomena. Understanding bound state superpositions could enable novel quantum devices with persistent dynamics and long-range emitter interactions.

Method: Theoretical investigation of a cavity array waveguide coupled to two spatially separated quantum emitters. The authors analytically derive conditions for bound-state superpositions and numerically simulate spontaneous emission dynamics.

Result: Discovery of non-local equilibrium states with persistent oscillations in both photonic and emitter populations, arising from hybrid modes of bound states embedded in and outside the energy continuum. These states enable emitter-emitter interaction via free evolution and oscillatory photon breathing modes between emitters.

Conclusion: Bound-state superpositions provide a robust mechanism for generating long-lived oscillatory quantum states and non-local interactions in waveguide QED systems, offering potential for quantum information applications.

Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics platforms have emerged as promising candidates for exploring and implementing non-Markovian quantum phenomena. In this work, we investigate the formation and dynamics of superpositions of bound states in a cavity array waveguide coupled to two spatially separated quantum emitters. By tuning the system parameters, we show that spontaneous emission can drive the system into non-local equilibrium states in which both photonic and emitter populations exhibit persistent oscillations. These states arise from the coexistence of bound states embedded in the energy continuum and bound states outside it, leading to hybrid oscillatory modes. We analytically derive the conditions required for the emergence of these states, numerically simulate their formation through spontaneous emission, and predict their long-time behaviour. Our results demonstrate that such bound-state superpositions enable the generation of emitter-emitter interaction through free evolution, while supporting oscillatory breathing modes of the photon density between the emitters.

TL;DR: 研究含时变驱动哈密顿量的Lindblad主方程量子系统的指数收缩性，证明在驱动足够小/慢时保持收缩性，但大/快驱动可破坏该性质；提出耗散器固定时与哈密顿量无关的收缩性充分条件，并完全刻画单态耗散器和二能级系统的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际物理系统中量子系统常同时受环境退相干（由Lindblad方程描述）和时变控制场作用，但现有理论对时变Lindbladian的收缩性（初始态信息指数丢失）理解不足，尤其当耗散器固定而哈密顿量时变时，系统何时保持指数收缩性尚不明确。

Method: 理论分析固定耗散器+时变驱动哈密顿量的Lindbladian系统；通过数学推导建立小/慢驱动下的指数收缩性条件，构造反例说明大/快驱动导致非收缩动力学，并推导耗散器本身的充分条件以实现哈密顿量无关的收缩性。

Result: 1) 驱动足够小或足够慢时系统保持指数收缩；2) 即使固定耗散器自身收缩，大/快驱动可破坏收缩性（提供显式反例）；3) 给出耗散器固定时与哈密顿量无关收缩的充分条件，完全解决了单态耗散器和二能级系统的该问题。

Conclusion: 建立了时变Lindbladian系统收缩性的分析框架，揭示了驱动强度/速率对动力学性质的临界影响，提出的充分条件为量子控制中设计环境无关的鲁棒操作提供了理论依据，特别对量子比特系统有明确指导意义。

Abstract: In a number of physically relevant contexts, a quantum system interacting with a decohering environment is simultaneously subjected to time-dependent controls and its dynamics is thus described by a time-dependent Lindblad master equation. Of particular interest in such systems is to understand the circumstances in which, despite the ability to apply time-dependent controls, they lose information about their initial state exponentially with time i.e., their dynamics are exponentially contractive. While there exists an extensive framework to study contractivity for time-independent Lindbladians, their time-dependent counterparts are far less well understood. In this paper, we study the contractivity of Lindbladians, which have a fixed dissipator (describing the interaction with an environment), but with a time-dependent driving Hamiltonian. We establish exponential contractivity in the limit of sufficiently small or sufficiently slow drives together with explicit examples showing that, even when the fixed dissipator is exponentially contractive by itself, a sufficiently large or a sufficiently fast Hamiltonian can result in non-contractive dynamics. Furthermore, we provide a number of sufficient conditions on the fixed dissipator that imply exponential contractivity independently of the Hamiltonian. These sufficient conditions allow us to completely characterize Hamiltonian-independent contractivity for unital dissipators and for two-level systems.

Abstract: Lie algebras provide a useful framework for theoretical analysis in quantum machine learning, particularly in hybrid quantum-classical learning. From the viewpoint of function approximation, expectation values of parameterized quantum circuits can be viewed as trigonometric polynomials whose accessible Fourier modes are determined by the spectra of the generators. In this study, we describe: (1) a minimax lower bound on the $ L^{2} $-approximation error over a Sobolev ball when the circuit's effective frequency set is contained in a radius-$K$ ball, which yields a scaling law of the form $ Ω(K^{\frac{d}{2} - r}) $ for $ r > \frac{d}{2} $ (assuming the target function belongs to the Sobolev space $ W_2^{r}(\mathbb{T}^{d}) $), and we also derive a Jackson-type upper bound on the approximation error of quantum circuits under Sobolev regularity of the target function, expressed in terms of an effective bandwidth determined by generator spectral gaps; (2) a generator-selection rule motivated by enlarging the effective frequency set via non-commuting generators; and (3) a simple heuristic metric based on the trace component of generators, aimed at characterizing training behaviors related to barren plateaus. Simulation experiments on toy problems illustrate the practical implications of the frequency-spectrum perspective and the proposed heuristics.

TL;DR: 针对保真度量子核的指数浓度问题，研究提出了局部和多层级核方法。通过Qiskit在多个表格数据集上实证表明，这些方法能有效缓解浓度并获得更丰富的核谱，但分类性能改进依赖于具体数据集和特征维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保真度量子核虽然连接了量子特征映射与经典核方法，但存在指数浓度问题：随着系统规模或电路表达能力增加，Gram矩阵趋近单位矩阵，导致信息相似性结构被抑制。

Method: 在Qiskit中实现两种缓解策略：(i) 局部（分块）核聚合子系统相似性；(ii) 多层级核混合不同分块粒度的局部与全局相似性。在多个表格数据集上采用匹配的预处理、分割和SVM协议，扫描特征维度d∈{4,6,…,20}，使用非对角核统计、有效秩和中心化对齐等指标评估。

Result: 局部和多层级核结构在所有数据集上均能持续缓解浓度，产生比全局保真度基线更丰富的核谱；对分类准确率的影响取决于具体数据集和特征维度。

Conclusion: 局部和多层级核方法是缓解量子核浓度问题的有效策略，能提供更丰富的核谱，但其在分类任务上的实际效益需根据具体数据集和维度进行评估。

Abstract: Fidelity-based quantum kernels provide a direct interface between quantum feature maps and classical kernel methods, but they can exhibit exponential concentration: with increasing system size or circuit expressivity, the Gram matrix approaches the identity and suppresses informative similarity structure. We present an empirical study of two mitigation strategies implemented in Qiskit: (i) local (patch-wise) kernels that aggregate subsystem similarities, and (ii) multi-scale kernels that mix local and global similarity across patch granularities.
  We benchmark baseline, local, and multi-scale kernels under matched preprocessing, splits, and SVM protocols on several tabular datasets, sweeping the feature dimension $d\in\{4,6,\dots,20\}$. We report concentration diagnostics based on off-diagonal kernel statistics, spectral richness via effective rank, and centered alignment with labels. Across datasets, local and multi-scale constructions consistently mitigate concentration and yield richer kernel spectra relative to the global fidelity baseline, while the impact on classification accuracy depends on the dataset and dimension.

Result: 1) 动力学李代数结构随固定变量的选择而剧烈变化；2) 在明确示例中，维度可从指数级坍缩至平方级；3) 非对称图的数值实验表明约简后的动力学李代数维度显著减小，暗示可训练性提升；4) 任何图均可通过平方级开销嵌入稍大图中，使得约简后的动力学李代数呈现指数维度并在希尔伯特空间上不可约。

Conclusion: 对称性感知的约简方法为设计兼具表达力和可训练性的QAOA电路提供了原则性工具。

Abstract: The performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is closely tied to the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra (DLA) generated by its Hamiltonians, which determines both its expressivity and trainability. In this work, we show that classical symmetries can be systematically exploited as a design principle for QAOA. Focusing on the MaxCut problem with global bit-flip symmetry, we analyze reduced QAOA instances obtained by fixing a single variable and study how this choice affects the associated DLAs. We show that the structure of the DLAs can change dramatically depending on which variable is held fixed. In particular, we construct explicit examples where the dimension collapses from exponential to quadratic, uncovering phenomena that do not appear in the original formulation.
  Numerical experiments on asymmetric graphs indicate that such reductions often produce DLAs of much smaller dimension, suggesting improved trainability. We also prove that any graph can be embedded into a slightly larger one (requiring only quadratic overhead) such that the standard reduced DLA coincides with the free reduced DLA, in most cases implying exponential dimension and irreducibility on the Hilbert space for reduced QAOA instances. These results establish symmetry-aware reduction as a principled tool for designing expressive and potentially trainable QAOA circuits.

Abstract: In conventional lasers, the emitters are typically incoherent, radiating photons independently; in superradiant lasers, many coherent emitters radiate photons collectively, but they essentially do not interact with each other. Here, we present the concept of quantum many-body lasers, in which the emitters interact coherently and radiate collectively. In this proof-of-concept study, we consider a cavity coupled to many pumped spin-1/2 emitters with all-to-all interaction. We find that the squeezing induced by the coherent many-body interaction can be transferred from the spins to photons through superradiant lasing. This work illustrates the concept of using a pumped quantum many-body system to generate bright quantum light with quantum correlations beyond conventional optical coherence, which can facilitate quantum technologies and the study of nonlinear optics in the quantum realm.

Motivation: 当物理约束（如对称性或超选择规则）被施加时，纠缠的结构和操作行为会发生剧烈变化，产生局部广播、纠缠单配性失效等违反直觉的现象。这些效应出现在层析非局域理论中，但其起源和本质尚不清楚。

Result: 发现层析非局域纠缠无法用于贝尔非局域性、导引和隐形传态，但足以支持密集编码和完全安全的数据隐藏；层析局域纠缠则表现不同。该框架澄清了费米子量子理论和超选择规则中令人困惑的纠缠特性。

Conclusion: 层析局域性的失效会导致两种本质不同的纠缠形式，这一分类框架解释了标准量子理论中（如费米子系统或存在超选择规则时）出现的若干令人困惑的纠缠现象。

Abstract: Entanglement is a central and subtle feature of quantum theory, whose structure and operational behavior can change dramatically when additional physical constraints, such as symmetries or superselection rules, are imposed. Such constraints can give rise to striking and counter-intuitive phenomena, including local broadcasting of entangled states and failures of entanglement monogamy. These effects naturally arise in tomographically nonlocal theories (like real quantum theory, twirled worlds, or fermionic quantum theory), where composite systems possess holistic degrees of freedom that are inaccessible to local measurements. In this work, we study entanglement in such theories within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. We show that the failure of tomographic locality leads to two qualitatively distinct forms of entanglement, which we term $\textit{tomographically-local}$ entanglement and $\textit{tomographically-nonlocal}$ entanglement. We analyze the operational consequences of this distinction, proving that tomographically-nonlocal entanglement is useless for Bell nonlocality, steering, and teleportation, but sufficient for dense coding and perfectly secure data hiding. This framework clarifies the origin of several previously puzzling features of entanglement that arise when tomographic locality fails, as can happen even in quantum theory when one considers fermions or fundamental superselection rules.

Motivation: 探究基于记录的过程（如进化）如何从量子力学中涌现，特别是当量子操作如复制和删除并非通用操作，而仅限于经典数据领域时，主体性和经典资源在其中的作用。

Method: 运用范畴量子力学（CQM）框架分析量子操作的结构限制，通过理论推演审视退相干、主体约束、扩展Wigner朋友场景等概念，并提出具有可变扩散的随机力学基础作为替代方案。

Result: 1) 复制/删除仅在已实现的经典数据领域存在；2) 退相干本身不能选择唯一结果；3) 主体约束表明纯量子体系中因不可克隆和线性性而无法支持最小主体性；4) 扩展Wigner朋友场景揭示了主体记录与量子描述间的张力；5) 随机力学基础为量子-经典过渡提供了连续桥梁。

Conclusion: 经典资源对基于记录的进化过程至关重要，而具有可变扩散的随机力学基础为理解量子到经典的转变、实现时间对称的最小改变测量更新规则提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: Darwinian evolution requires (i) heritable records, (ii) repeatable copying with variation, and (iii) routine irreversibility. Categorical quantum mechanics (CQM) makes precise why ``copy'' and ``delete'' are not generic quantum operations: they exist only for a realized \emph{classical data} sector (a preferred basis/observable; a commutative structure). Decoherence explains how a pointer basis can be selected dynamically, but it does not by itself select a unique outcome. This motivates a neutral presentation of the main ontological options (unique-history, decohered multiplicity, agent-relative facticity, and a stochastic foundation with variable diffusion). We also note the relevance of the ``agency constraint'' argued by Adlam-McQueen-Waegell: in a strictly coherent, basis-unselected ``purely quantum'' regime, minimal agency fails due to no-cloning and linearity, which sharpens the role of classical resources for record-based processes. Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios then serve as a stress test, since they treat ``friends'' simultaneously as coherent quantum systems and as agents possessing stable records. Finally, a stochastic-mechanics foundation (with variable diffusion) offers a continuous bridge between quantum and classical regimes, and suggests a principled way to implement measurement update as conditioning plus a time-symmetric minimal-change rule.

Motivation: 非马尔可夫量子随机过程在描述开放量子系统和量子基础方面非常重要，但解析处理困难；且其马尔可夫极限在使用Ito或Stratonovich约定时通常不一致，亟需一种能够粗粒化并消除歧义的方法。

Method: 采用量子噪声均化方案：首先通过相空间增广将非马尔可夫动力学嵌入更高维的马尔可夫系统；随后在噪声的特征时间尺度上实施受控的微扰粗粒化，从而得到有效的马尔可夫生成元。

Result: 1. 得到显式的分析算法，能够导出带有重整化系数的有效马尔可夫生成元；2. 解决了Ito‑Stratonovich歧义，证明一致的马尔可夫极限对应于Stratonovich约定（系数经重整化）并包含Ito修正项；3. 在假设马尔可夫极限满足完全正定且保迹的条件下，刻画了一类物理上相关的非马尔可夫量子随机过程。

Conclusion: 该量子噪声均化方案成功地将非马尔可夫、彩色噪声驱动的量子随机过程与白噪声（马尔可夫）极限相连接，消除了Ito‑Stratonovich歧义，并提供了在重整化系数和物理约束下构造有效马尔可夫动力学的一般框架。

Abstract: Quantum stochastic processes are widely used in describing open quantum systems and in the context of quantum foundations. Physically relevant quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise are generically non-Markovian and analytically intractable. Further, their Markovian limits are generically inequivalent when using either the Ito or Stratonovich conventions for the same quantum stochastic processes. We introduce a quantum noise homogenization scheme that temporally coarse-grains non-Markovian, colored-noise driven quantum stochastic processes and connects them to their effective white-noise (Markovian) limits. Our approach uses a novel phase-space augmentation that maps the non-Markovian dynamics into a higher dimensional Markovian system and then applies a controlled perturbative coarse-graining scheme in the characteristic time scales of the noise. This allows an explicit analytical algorithm to derive effective Markovian generators with renormalized coefficients and enables imposing various physical constraints on them. We thus resolve the Ito-Stratonovich ambiguity for multiplicative colored noise driven quantum stochastic processes, wherein we show that their consistent Markovian limit corresponds to the Stratonovich convention with renormalized coefficients as well as Ito correction terms. By assuming their Markovian limit unravels completely positive, trace-preserving maps, we further characterize a physically relevant family of non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise.

Motivation: 直接演示傅里叶域中的量子增强传感，并在严格相同的噪声条件下提供公平明确的量子优势基准测试。

Method: 在基于光纤的干涉仪中同时采集单光子和双光子干涉信号，获得共模参考基准，并进行频谱分析。

Result: 量子关联并未增加调制峰幅度，而是降低了噪声基底，实现了预期的3 dB信噪比改善；在亚散粒噪声区域，经典信号被频谱背景淹没时，双光子贡献仍可被分辨。

Conclusion: 傅里叶域量子超灵敏度是一种可用于精密干涉传感的实用且广泛适用的资源。

Abstract: We report a direct demonstration of quantum-enhanced sensing in the Fourier domain by comparing single- and two-photon interference in a fiber-based interferometer under strictly identical noise conditions. The simultaneous acquisition of both signals provides a common-mode reference that enables a fair and unambiguous benchmark of quantum advantage. Spectral analysis of the interferometric outputs reveals that quantum correlations do not increase the amplitude of the modulation peak, but instead lower the associated noise floor, resulting in the expected 3 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio. This enhancement persists in the sub-shot-noise regime, where the classical signal becomes buried in the spectral background while the two-photon contribution remains resolvable. These observations establish Fourier-domain quantum super-sensitivity as an operational and broadly applicable resource for precision interferometric sensing.

Contrary to the usual approach in quantum logic, our formalism is based classical first-order logic, which allows us to use the tools of model theory in our study. In particular, we show that our formal theory is complete, meaning that it entirely determines the behaviour of quantum systems. Moreover, we provide a characterization of the models of our formal theory, thus providing new insights in the study of hidden variable models of quantum theory.

### [124] [Why the Casimir Force for Magnetic Metals Computed by the Lifshitz Theory Using the Drude Model Disagrees with the Measurement Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16370)
*G. L. Klimchitskaya,C. C. Korikov,V. M. Mostepanenko*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This study analyzes why Lifshitz theory using the Drude model fails to accurately predict Casimir forces for magnetic metal plates (Au-Ni, Ni-Ni). By decomposing electromagnetic wave contributions, they find the discrepancy stems entirely from the transverse electric contribution, which is model-dependent for magnetic metals, while the transverse magnetic contribution remains model-independent. Magnetic properties only affect propagating waves in the TE contribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Lifshitz theory using the Drude model for dielectric permittivity produces predictions inconsistent with experimental measurements of Casimir force in magnetic metal configurations. The underlying reasons for this discrepancy, particularly regarding the roles of different electromagnetic wave polarizations (TM/TE) and wave types (evanescent/propagating), were not well understood.

Method: Computations of transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarization contributions to the Casimir force using Lifshitz theory with imaginary Matsubara frequencies. The fractions of evanescent and propagating waves in these contributions were determined via an equivalent real-frequency formulation. Calculations were performed for Au-Ni and Ni-Ni plate configurations using both Drude and plasma models across 0.5-6 μm separations where conduction electrons dominate the force.

Result: The TM contribution is independent of the dielectric model used. The discrepancy between theory and experiment is entirely due to the TE contribution. For magnetic metals (unlike nonmagnetic ones), both evanescent and propagating wave fractions in the TE contribution depend on the dielectric model. Magnetic properties only influence the Casimir force through the fraction of propagating waves in the TE contribution.

Conclusion: Current theoretical descriptions of electromagnetic response in magnetic metals are inadequate. Accurate Casimir force predictions require careful modeling of the TE contribution, and magnetic properties significantly impact propagating wave components. The study calls for a more refined theoretical framework to describe electromagnetic response of magnetic metals in Casimir force calculations.

Abstract: We consider the Casimir force in configurations with magnetic metal plates and analyze the reasons why the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the dielectric permittivity of the Drude model are inconsistent with the measurement data. For this purpose, the contributions of the electromagnetic waves with the transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations to the Casimir force are computed using the Lifshitz theory expressed in terms of the pure imaginary Matsubara frequencies. Furthermore, the fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in these contributions are found using an equivalent formulation of the Lifshitz theory along the real frequency axis. All computations are performed for Au-Ni and Ni-Ni plates using the Drude model and the experimentally consistent plasma model over the separation region from 0.5 to 6~mum, where the total force value is determined by conduction electrons. It is shown that the transverse magnetic contribution to the Casimir force does not depend on the used model of the dielectric permittivity, so that the total difference between the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the Drude model and the measurement data is determined by the transverse electric contribution. In doing so, as opposed to the case of nonmagnetic metals, both fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in this contribution depend on the model of the dielectric permittivity used in computations, whereas the magnetic properties of the plate metal influence the Casimir force solely through the fraction of propagating waves in the transverse electric contribution. The issue of a more adequate theoretical description of the electromagnetic response of magnetic metals is discussed.

### [125] [Solving the Mysteries of Quantum Mechanics: Why Nature Abhors a Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16382)
*Tim Palmer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes Rational Quantum Mechanics (RaQM) with gravitationally discretized Hilbert space, claiming this resolves quantum mysteries by revealing a hidden number-theoretic property of cosine that implies holistic indivisibility and explains why complex numbers are used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feynman's claim that interference is QM's only real mystery, and the belief that the continuum nature of Hilbert space is unphysical and the root cause of multiple quantum mysteries (complementarity, non-commutativity, uncertainty, Bell violation).

Method: Developed RaQM theory with gravitationally discretized Hilbert space; identified a number-theoretic property of the cosine function concealed in continuum QM; used this to derive holistic principles.

Result: Claims to solve QM mysteries by replacing nonlocality/non-realism with holism (Mach's Principle, fractal geometry); explains why nature uses complex numbers; contrasts holism as comprehensible vs nonlocality as incomprehensible.

Conclusion: The continuum-based axioms of QM are the source of its mysteries; discretization reveals that quantum physics is fundamentally holistic and indivisible, making nonlocality unnecessary and providing a physical explanation for complex numbers.

Abstract: Feynman famously asserted that interference is the only real mystery in quantum mechanics (QM). It is concluded that the reason for this mystery, and thereby the related mysteries of complementarity, non-commutativity of observables, the uncertainty principle and violation of Bell's equality, is that the axioms of QM depend vitally on the continuum nature of Hilbert Space, deemed unphysical. We develop a theory of quantum physics - Rational Quantum Mechanics (RaQM) - in which Hilbert Space is gravitationally discretised. The key to solving the mysteries of QM in RaQM is a number-theoretic property of the cosine function, concealed in QM when angles range over the continuum. This number-theoretic property describes mathematically the utter indivisibility of the quantum world and implies that the laws of physics are profoundly holistic. We contrast holism with nonlocality. In theories which embrace the continuum, the violation of Bell's inequality requires the laws of physics to be either nonlocal or not realistic; both incomprehensible concepts. By contrast, holism, as embodied in Mach's Principle or in the fractal geometry of a chaotic attractor, is neither incomprehensible nor unphysical. As part of this, we solve the deepest mystery of all; why nature makes use of complex numbers.

Conclusion: 非对称离散时间量子行走是研究光子离域化和混合纠缠的理想平台，其特性可通过不对称性进行调控和增强。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the enhancement of delocalization and coin-position entanglement in asymmetric discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs). The asymmetry results from asymmetric coin operations, asymmetric initial states, and asymmetric polarization-dependent losses. By varying these asymmetry factors, the inverse participation ratio and entanglement entropy of the walker are numerically calculated for different coin and loss parameters, both for symmetric and asymmetric initial states. We then experimentally implement a 16-step asymmetric DTQW using a time-multiplexing fiber loop structure. By choosing an asymmetric initial state, both coin-position entanglement and delocalization are simultaneously enhanced under specific coin parameters. Moreover, we observe that with finite asymmetric polarization-dependent loss, the photon probability on the left side decreases significantly, while that on the right side increases and becomes more localized. Interestingly, under specific coin parameters, the entanglement and delocalization exhibit improved robustness against polarization-dependent loss. These results demonstrate that the DTQWs constitute an ideal platform for investigating photonic delocalization and hybrid entanglement.

Abstract: Preparing subradiant steady states of collectively emitting quantum two-level emitters (TLEs) is hindered by their dark, weakly interacting nature. Existing approaches rely on patterned driving, local control, or structured environments. We propose a platform-independent protocol based on projective measurements on a single TLE. For permutation-symmetric ensembles, a single measurement yields appreciable occupation of single-excitation subradiant steady states. For generic arrays, repeated measurements on one emitter drive the unmeasured TLEs into a nearly pure state with large overlap with the subradiant Dicke subspace.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子力学中测量结果的可预测性本质，以及量子纠缠和噪声如何影响不同观测者之间无需经典通信的预测能力，从而深入理解量子非局域性的特征。

Method: 定义了非局域可预测性及其局域边界，通过比较测量前后预测概率的差异，分析纯态、纠缠态、经典关联态以及退相干效应对非局域可预测性的影响。

Result: 乘积态总是满足局域边界；纠缠态和某些经典关联态可以超越该边界；最大纠缠态在任意投影测量下具有完美的非局域可预测性；单粒子退相干可以增强非局域可预测性，但该效应在最大纠缠态下消失。

Conclusion: 非局域可预测性是一种真正的量子现象，揭示了纠缠在增强预测能力中的特殊作用，同时展示了噪声在某些情况下反而能产生优势的有趣效应，为理解量子关联的本质提供了新视角。

Abstract: We define nonlocal predictability as how well one observer can predict another's measurement outcomes without classical communication, given full knowledge of the shared quantum state and measurement settings. The local bound on nonlocal predictability is defined as the maximum probability with which one observer can correctly predict the other's measurement outcome prior to measurement. We show that product states always meet this bound, while all pure entangled states and some classically correlated states can exceed it. This demonstrates a nonlocal phenomenon since the predictability of measurement outcomes increases after the measurement. Perfect nonlocal predictability for arbitrary projective measurements occurs only for maximally entangled states among all pure states, underscoring their special role. Comparing pure entangled states with their dephased versions, we find that dephasing on one subsystem can enhance nonlocal predictability for a broad class of states and measurements - a counterintuitive, noise-induced advantage that vanishes for maximally entangled states under any projective measurement.

Result: 发现两种拓扑相均在带隙频率处产生squeezing；谐波谱可区分拓扑相，但squeezing程度仅在短链时区分，源于小体系中体相-边缘态重叠增加

Conclusion: 电偶极耦合强度调控非经典谐波响应，为拓扑保护量子光产生开辟新研究方向

Abstract: The strong-field process of high-harmonic generation (HHG) has, in recent years, been treated from a quantum optical perspective in the emerging research area of strong-field quantum optics. These investigations show that HHG radiation is, in general, in a nonclassical state of light. However, the quantum optical treatment of HHG from topological nontrivial materials is missing. Here, we aim to address this gap in current knowledge and consider the quantum optical HHG response from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, a finite chain of atoms with both a topologically trivial and nontrivial insulating phase, the latter supporting edge states. We find that HHG from both topological phases is squeezed at the band-gap frequency. Interestingly, while the harmonic spectrum discriminates the two topological phases of the system, the degree of squeezing only discriminates the phases for smaller chain lengths. We attribute this difference to a relative increase in overlap between bulk and edge states in the topological nontrivial phase for smaller systems. Our findings reveal how the strength of dipole couplings governs the nonclassical HHG response and define new research questions on topologically protected generation of quantum light in strong-field physics.

Abstract: Sources of quantum correlated photons pairs bridging the 3um-4um Mid-infrared (MIR) band and Telecom/Near-Infrared/Visible band are of high importance for quantum technologies. Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion is generally used for realizing such sources, but requires costly implementation platforms with reduced versatility. Here, we explore the potentialities of Spontaneous Four-Wave Mixing (SFWM) in all-solid Silicon On Insulator (SOI) waveguides thanks to an experimentally validated model and propose designs ensuring the production of correlated photon pairs bridging the 3um-4um Mid-infrared band and Telecom C-band. Choosing a pump with a wavelength in the range 2100nm-2210nm and a pulse duration of 5ps, we quantitatively performed simulations targeting a probability of photon pair generation per pulse of 0.05, and we found realistic conditions of utilization (2cm-length straight waveguides, intra-modal Four Wave Mixing with the fundamental TE00 mode) with a pump peak power in between 9.2mW and 32mW. A first design (wCOM) reaches a signal wavelength as high as 3.905um, which is situated in an atmospheric transparency window, while maintaining an idler in the Telecom C-band, making it of high interest for atmospheric Quantum Key Distribution. Two other designs wCH4 and wNO2 aim precise CH4 and NO2 gas sensing with a signal wavelength of 3265nm and 3461nm respectively. In terms of signal/idler wavelength separation, wCOM attains the value of 2364nm which is well above the current record of ~1125nm obtained in quantum regime with SFWM in all-solid SOI waveguides.

Abstract: The Casimir-Polder force is analyzed when an atom is moving at a constant velocity relative to a collection of translationally invariant macroscopic bodies with generic shapes and compositions. The interaction is described within an approach that accurately treats the atom-field coupling and accounts for the backaction from the environment onto the moving particle. Previously overlooked aspects are uncovered and linked to the nonequilibrium and nonconservative nature of the interaction. Specifically, we examine a behavior that can be understood by characterizing the underlying physical processes in terms of a motional-induced effective temperature. This phenomenon shares similarities with the Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect, opening new perspectives for the understanding of nonequilibrium physics at work in the system.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper analyzes noise effects in deterministic port-based teleportation, examining two scenarios: decoherence on entangled resources with ideal measurements, and noise-adapted measurements. It derives analytical expressions for entanglement fidelity, surprisingly finding noise-adapted measurements perform worse than noiseless ones, and connects the model to physical spin boson systems to study environmental memory and temperature effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how realistic noise affects deterministic port-based teleportation protocols, particularly when both the entangled resource states and measurement processes are subject to physically motivated noise models, bridging abstract noise descriptions with microscopic physical implementations.

Method: Analytical derivation of lower bounds and closed-form expressions for entanglement fidelity in the decoherence-only scenario; combined semi-analytical and numerical methods for the noisy measurement scenario; embedding the protocol in a spin boson model to study bath memory and temperature effects.

Result: Derived analytical expressions for entanglement fidelity showing asymptotic behavior; discovered that noise-adapted measurements surprisingly underperform compared to ideal noiseless measurements; identified qualitative differences in teleportation fidelity depending on environmental memory and temperature in the spin boson model.

Conclusion: The study reveals fundamental limitations of noise-adaptation strategies in port-based teleportation under physically realistic conditions, provides analytical tools for quantifying performance degradation, and establishes important connections between abstract noise models and microscopic environmental physics that affect quantum communication protocols.

Abstract: We study deterministic port based teleportation in the presence of noise affecting both the entangled resource state and the measurement process. We focus on a physically motivated model in which each Bell pair constituting the resource interacts with an identical local environment, corresponding to independently distributed entangled links. Two noisy scenarios are analyzed: one with decoherence acting solely on the resource state and ideal measurements, and another with noisy, noise adapted measurements optimised for the given noise model. In the first case, we derive an analytical lower bound and later a closed-form expression for the entanglement fidelity of the teleportation channel and analyze its asymptotic behaviour. In the second, we combine semi analytical and numerical methods. Surprisingly, we find that noise-adapted measurements perform worse than the noiseless ones. To connect the abstract noise description with microscopic physics, we embed the protocol in a spin boson model and investigate the influence of bath memory and temperature on the teleportation fidelity, highlighting qualitative differences between different environments.

Abstract: We consider the amplification of bosonic interactions through parametric control that implements squeezing along orthogonal quadratures. We show that bosonic interactions described by certain classes of quadratic and quartic Hamiltonians can be enhanced in this way while simultaneously overcoming noise and decoherence. In general, the amplification method enhances both desired and undesired interactions present in the system. Depending on the case, however, detrimental processes can be less amplified than the desired couplings. We leverage this observation to improve the fidelity for preparing Bell-type entangled states between two bosonic modes in the presence of noise and losses. We also investigate noise models for which the protocol either fails or partially achieves a loss-tolerant state preparation speedup. Our work facilitates faster preparation of complex quantum states and implementation of entangling gates in the presence of decoherence mechanisms.

TL;DR: This paper studies quantum bound states of a scalar particle in a helically twisted 3D geometry, revealing that torsion alone can create effective confinement without external potentials, using numerical solutions of the curved-space Schrödinger equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how non-trivial three-dimensional torsion (helical twisting) in spatial geometry influences quantum bound states, including potential confinement effects from geometry alone and interactions with magnetic fluxes.

Method: Solving the Schrödinger equation on a curved helical background via separation of variables, reducing it to a 1D radial Sturm–Liouville problem. Numerical solutions using finite-difference discretization with convergence control, analyzing four potential scenarios (free, Cornell, Kratzer, Morse).

Result: Torsion induces Coulomb/centrifugal-like effective potentials; geometric coupling alone creates bound states without external interactions. Systematic energy level dependencies on torsion, magnetic flux, and azimuthal sector are quantified across all four potential models.

Conclusion: Helical torsion fundamentally alters quantum confinement properties, demonstrating that curved geometry can replace traditional external potentials for particle binding—a significant insight for quantum models in non-Euclidean spaces.

Abstract: We investigate bound states of a non-relativistic scalar particle in a three-dimensional helically twisted (torsional) geometry, considering both the free case and the presence of external radial interactions. The dynamics is described by the Schrödinger equation on a curved spatial background and, when included, by minimal coupling to a magnetic vector potential incorporating an Aharonov--Bohm flux. After separation of variables, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional radial eigenvalue equation governed by an effective potential that combines torsion-induced Coulomb-like and centrifugal-like structures with magnetic/flux-dependent terms and optional model interactions. Because closed-form analytic solutions are not reliable over the parameter ranges required for systematic scans, we compute spectra and eigenfunctions numerically by formulating the radial equation as a self-adjoint Sturm--Liouville problem and solving it with a finite-difference discretization on a truncated radial domain, with explicit convergence control. We analyze four representative scenarios: (i) no external potential, (ii) Cornell-type confinement, (iii) Kratzer-type interaction, and (iv) the small-oscillation regime around the minimum of a Morse potential. We present systematic trends of the low-lying levels as functions of the torsion parameter, magnetic field, and azimuthal sector, and we show that geometric couplings alone can produce effective confinement even in the absence of an external interaction.
