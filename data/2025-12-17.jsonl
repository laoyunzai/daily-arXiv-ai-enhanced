For opposite driving, at higher drives a phase-separated laned state forms that has strong hysteresis in the velocity-force curve and the fraction of topological defects as the drive is cycled up and down from zero. The amount of hysteresis depends on the drive value at which the drive changes from increasing to decreasing. For perpendicular driving, we find a jammed state that transitions into a disordered state or a tilted lane state, both of which also show strong hysteresis effects. Additionally, a negative drag effect can appear in which one species moves in the direction opposite to the other species due to a tilting of the lanes by the perpendicular drive. When a constant drive is applied along one direction while the drive in the perpendicular direction is increased, we observe a series of drops and jumps in the velocity as the system forms locked and tilted laned states. For weakly interacting particles, the jammed system can show co-tilted stripe-forming states."}

Specifically, we focus on Sauter-like pulse trains with random time delays between successive pulses, drawn from a Gaussian distribution wherein the extent of fluctuations is controlled by the standard deviation $σ_T$ of the distribution. We find that increasing $σ_T$ leads to a dramatic transformation in the longitudinal momentum spectrum. The well-known fringe pattern, akin to that in the multi-slit interference, gets significantly modified. The averaged spectra exhibit a robust Gaussian-like envelope with residual oscillations, which are much more prominent in the central momentum region. Notably, we find that in certain cases, stochastic time delays lead to a pronounced enhancement in the central peak of the distribution function for pulse train containing $N$ pulses. For example, for $N=20$ pulses, $σ_T \\approx 31$ $[m^{-1}]$(about $17\\%$ of the mean time delay) yields nearly a tenfold increase in the central peak, which for $σ_T \\approx 50$ $[m^{-1}]$ (about $27\\%$ of the mean time delay), scales up to $10^3.$ This may open up new possibilities for optimizing multi-pulse field configurations and guide future experimental designs aimed at maximizing EPPs creation."}

In the current work, we combine unsupervised and supervised learning using an autoencoder to establish that unlabeled data in the Majorana splitting in realistic short disordered nanowires may enable not only a distinction between `topological' and `trivial', but also where their crossover happens in the relevant parameter space.

This paper presents a blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel measurements without relying on location labels. It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories.

Using the bosonization approach, we investigate various correlation functions at the phase transition and derive their asymptotic forms.

The theory treats the age of a particle -- the time since its last reset -- as an explicit dynamical variable and allows for resetting rules which introduce global inter-particle correlations. The anomalous diffusion is modeled by the scaled Brownian motion (sBm): a Gaussian process with independent increments, characterized by a power-law time dependence of the diffusion coefficient, $D(t)\\sim t^{2H-1}$, where $H>0$. We apply this theory to three different resetting protocols: independent resetting to the origin (model~A), resetting to the origin of the particle farthest from it (model~B), and a scaled-diffusion extension of the ``Brownian bees\" model of Berestycki et al, Ann. Probab. \\textbf{50}, 2133 (2022). In all these models non-equilibrium steady states are reached at long times, and we determine the steady-state densities. For model A the (normalized to unity) steady-state density coincides with the steady-state probability density of a single particle undergoing sBM with resetting to the origin. For model B, and for the scaled Brownian bees, the HD steady-state densities are markedly different: in particular, they have compact supports for all $H>0$. The age-structured HD formalism can be extended to other anomalous diffusion processes with renewal resetting protocols which introduce global inter-particle correlations."}

Based on the proposition, supported by several exactly solved cases though not proven in full generality, that ``if a one-dimensional system is gapless, then the expectation value of any local observable in the ground state of the Hamiltonian with SSD exhibits translational symmetry in the thermodynamic limit,\" we determine the quantum critical point as the location where a local observable becomes site-independent, identified through finite-size scaling analysis. As case studies, we consider two models: the antiferromagnetic Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions. We calculate the ground state of these Hamiltonians with SSD using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm and evaluate the local transverse magnetization. For the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the quantum critical point can be accurately estimated by our procedure with systems of up to 84 sites, or even smaller, in good agreement with results from the literature. For the long-range model, we find that the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is slightly shifted relative to the nearest-neighbor case, leading to a reduced region of antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, we propose an experimental procedure to implement the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising couplings with SSD using Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers, which can be achieved within a very good approximation. Because multiple independent scaling conditions naturally emerge, our approach enables precise determination of quantum critical points and possibly even the extraction of additional critical phenomena, such as critical exponents, from relatively small system sizes."}

The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--König theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, however at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \\mathrm{diag}(1, e^{iπ/(4N)})$ in the logical $\\overline{Z}$ basis. For $8N = 2^n$, this gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice.

Here, we explore the DTC in a disorder-free, periodically kicked XXZ spin chain, which is stabilized by the Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation. We numerically show the period-doubling response of the conventional DTC order, and uncover a multiple-period response with beating dynamics due to the coherent interplay of multiple $π$-pairs in the Floquet spectrum of small-size systems. The lifetime of the DTC order exhibits independence of the driving frequency and a power-law dependence on the ZZ interaction strength. It also grows exponentially with the system size, as a hallmark of the strong fragmentation inherent to the Floquet model. We analytically reveal the approximate conservation of the magnetization and domain-wall number in the Floquet operator for the emergent strong fragmentation, which is consistent with numerical results of the dimensionality ratio of symmetry subspaces. The rigidity and phase regime of the DTC order are identified through finite-size scaling of the Floquet-spectrum-averaged mutual information, as well as via dynamical probes. Our work establishes the Floquet Hilbert space fragmentation as a disorder-free mechanism for sustaining nontrivial temporal orders in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems."}

This study combines Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with environmental and hydrological data to model flood susceptibility in the River Nyando watershed, western Kenya. Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR data from the May 2024 flood event were processed to produce a binary flood inventory, which served as training data for machine learning (ML) models. Six conditioning factors -- slope, elevation, aspect, land use/land cover, soil type, and distance from streams -- were integrated with the SAR-derived flood inventory to train four supervised classifiers: Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results indicate that RF achieved the highest predictive performance (accuracy = 0.762; Kappa = 0.480), outperforming LR, CART, and SVM. The RF-based susceptibility map showed that low-lying Kano Plains near Lake Victoria have the highest flood vulnerability, consistent with historical flood records and the impacts of the May 2024 event. These findings demonstrate the value of combining SAR data and ensemble ML methods for flood susceptibility mapping in regions with limited data. The resulting maps offer important insights for disaster risk reduction, land-use planning, and early warning system development."}

The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Additional ablation and scalability studies confirm the method's robustness, achieving up to 40% faster adaptation and consistent fairness, latency, and throughput performance as network scale increases."}

First, we perform a single influence-style update that subtracts the contribution of all training points from the target class by solving a Hessian-vector system with conjugate gradients, requiring only gradient and Hessian-vector products. Second, in contrast to common unlearning baselines that randomly reclassify deleted-class samples, we enforce a decision-space guarantee via Top-1 classification.

Dropout methods are regularisation techniques for training NNs, first introduced by G. Hinton et al. (2012). These methods temporarily remove connections in the NN, randomly at each stage of training, and update the remaining subnetwork with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The process of removing connections from a network at random is similar to percolation, a paradigm model of statistical physics.\n  If dropout were to remove enough connections such that there is no path between the input and output of the NN, then the NN could not make predictions informed by the data. We study new percolation models that mimic dropout in NNs and characterise the relationship between network topology and this path problem. The theory shows the existence of a percolative effect in dropout. We also show that this percolative effect can cause a breakdown when training NNs without biases with dropout; and we argue heuristically that this breakdown extends to NNs with biases."}

In a first step we use the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which takes into account purely local correlations, to calculate the magnetic susceptibilities of the Hubbard model on three (3d-sc) and four dimensional (4d-sc) simple cubic/hypercubic, as well as on three dimensional body- (bcc) and face-centered (fcc) cubic lattices, and determine the transition temperature to the corresponding magnetically-ordered state. In a second step, we exploit the dynamical vertex approximation (D$Γ$A), a diagrammatic extension of DMFT, to include the effect of nonlocal correlations which are particularly important in the vicinity of the corresponding phase transition. For the bipartite 3d-sc, 4d-sc and bcc lattices nonlocal fluctuations lead to a substantial reduction of the DMFT transition temperature consistent to the overall tendency of mean-field approaches to overestimate the stability of ordered phases. As expected, the magnitude of the difference between the DMFT, being exact in the limit of large connectivity/dimensions, and D$Γ$A transition temperatures decreases with increasing coordination number. On a more practical perspective, these results also provide a reasonable guidance to evaluate the expected overestimation of the DMFT ordering temperature for different material geometries. For the fcc lattice, on the other hand, the ordered phase observed in DMFT vanishes completely within D$Γ$A which is consistent with the existence of strong geometric frustration in this lattice."}

As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness. This work provides an initial empirical map of compressed causal reasoning and practical guidance for deploying efficient and structurally supported causal AI systems."}

In clinical practice, EEG data are often scarce, patient-specific distributed across institutions, and governed by strict privacy regulations that prohibit data pooling. As a result, creating usable AI-based seizure detection models remains challenging in real-world medical settings. To address these constraints, we propose a two-stage federated few-shot learning (FFSL) framework for personalized EEG-based seizure detection. The method is trained and evaluated on the TUH Event Corpus, which includes six EEG event classes. In Stage 1, a pretrained biosignal transformer (BIOT) is fine-tuned across non-IID simulated hospital sites using federated learning, enabling shared representation learning without centralizing EEG recordings. In Stage 2, federated few-shot personalization adapts the classifier to each patient using only five labeled EEG segments, retaining seizure-specific information while still benefiting from cross-site knowledge. Federated fine-tuning achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.43 (centralized: 0.52), Cohen's kappa of 0.42 (0.49), and weighted F1 of 0.69 (0.74). In the FFSL stage, client-specific models reached an average balanced accuracy of 0.77, Cohen's kappa of 0.62, and weighted F1 of 0.73 across four sites with heterogeneous event distributions. These results suggest that FFSL can support effective patient-adaptive seizure detection under realistic data-availability and privacy constraints."}

Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter."}

In many practical schemes, the initial qubit configuration has to be inferred from readout that is a time-dependent weak measurement record. However, a combination of the measurement scheme and intrinsic dynamics can end up scrambling the initial state and lose information irretrievably. Here, we study the information physics of quantum trajectories based on weak measurements in order to address the optimal achievable performance in qubit configuration readout for two realistic models of single qubit readout: (i) Model I is informationally complete, but without intrinsic dynamics; (ii) Model II is informationally incomplete weak measurements with intrinsic dynamics. We first use mutual information to characterize how much intrinsic information about the initial state is encoded in the measurement record. Using a fixed discrete time-step formulation, we compute the mutual information while varying the measurement strength, duration of measurement record, and the relative strength of intrinsic dynamics in our measurement schemes. We also exploit the emergence of continuum scaling and the Stochastic Master Equation in the weak measurement limit. We develop an asymptotic expansion in the measurement efficiency parameter to calculate mutual information, which captures qualitative and quantitative features of the numerical data. The bounds on information extraction are manifested as plateaux in mutual information, our analysis obtains these bounds and also optimal duration of measurement required to saturate them. Our results should be useful both for quantum device operation and optimization and also, possibly, for improving the performance of recent machine learning approaches for qubit and multiqubit configuration readout in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) experiment regimes."}

However, existing approaches often oversimplify traffic dynamics or use shallow encoders that miss complex spatiotemporal patterns.\n  We introduce the Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which formalizes adaptive delayed matching as a regime-aware MDP equipped with a self-attention MoE encoder.

Here, we present an all-optical scheme that mitigates both effects using a single digital micromirror device (DMD) operated in a double-pass configuration, in which light interacts with two separate regions of the same device. In the first pass, one region of the DMD is placed in a Fourier plane and implements a binary-amplitude hologram for individual addressing, while in the second pass a different region serves as a programmable intermediate image-plane aperture for spatial filtering. By multiplexing the Fourier-plane hologram to include secondary holograms, we generate weak auxiliary fields that interfere destructively with unwanted light at selected sites, while image-plane filtering suppresses the residual tail at larger distances. Together, these techniques maintain relative intensity crosstalk at or below $10^{-5}$ ($-50\\,\\mathrm{dB}$) across the full field of view relevant for qubit addressing, and further reduce the far-wing background to approximately $10^{-6}$ at large distances from the addressed qubit, approaching the detection limit.

Instead of evolving probability densities in phase space (as in Liouville's equation), KvN uses a Schrödinger-like equation for a classical wavefunction, with commuting position and momentum operators. Mapped to quantum computing, KvN offers a promising route to simulate classical dynamical systems using quantum algorithms by leveraging unitary evolution and quantum linear algebra tools, potentially enabling efficient classical-to-quantum mappings without invoking full quantum uncertainty. In this work, we specifically explore the implementation of the KvN approach on continuous-variable photonic quantum computing architectures, with the goals of leveraging quantum simulation for both sampling and computing intractable nonlinear dynamics. We will demonstrate its implementation and feasibility with two problems: the harmonic oscillator and a 1D partial differential equation governing nonlinear dynamics."}

Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive."}

Acquiring such high-resolution wind data, however, remains a challenging and expensive endeavour. Traditional reconstruction approaches are typically either cost-effective or accurate, but not both. Deep learning methods, including diffusion models, have been proposed to resolve this trade-off by leveraging advances in natural image super-resolution. Wind data, however, is distinct from natural images, and wind super-resolvers often use upwards of 10 input channels, significantly more than the usual 3-channel RGB inputs in natural images. To better leverage a large number of conditioning variables in diffusion models, we present a generalization of classifier-free guidance (CFG) to multiple conditioning inputs. Our novel composite classifier-free guidance (CCFG) can be dropped into any pre-trained diffusion model trained with standard CFG dropout. We demonstrate that CCFG outputs are higher-fidelity than those from CFG on wind super-resolution tasks. We present WindDM, a diffusion model trained for industrial-scale wind dynamics reconstruction and leveraging CCFG. WindDM achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality among deep learning models and costs up to $1000\\times$ less than classical methods."}

Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--König theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, however at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \\mathrm{diag}(1, e^{iπ/(4N)})$ in the logical $\\overline{Z}$ basis. For $8N = 2^n$, this gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice.

Although analytic solutions exist for pulse timings that are optimal under specific noise regimes, identifying the optimal timings for a realistic noise spectrum remains challenging. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for designing pulse sequences on qubits. Our novel action set enables the RL agent to efficiently navigate this inherently non-convex optimization landscape. The action set, derived from Thompson's group $F$, is applicable to a broad class of sequential decision problems whose states can be represented as bounded sequences. We demonstrate that our RL agent can learn pulse sequences that minimize dephasing without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying noise spectrum. This work opens the possibility for real-time learning of optimal dynamical decoupling sequences on qubits which are dephasing-limited. The model-free nature of our algorithm suggests that the agent may ultimately learn optimal pulse sequences even in the presence of unmodeled physical effects, such as pulse errors or non-Gaussian noise."}

To this end, we propose MURIM, a MUlti-dimensional Reputation-based Incentive Mechanism that jointly considers client reliability, privacy, resource capacity, and fairness while preventing malicious or unreliable clients from earning undeserved rewards. MURIM allocates incentives based on client contribution, latency, and reputation, supported by a reliability verification module. Extensive experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and ADULT Income datasets demonstrate that MURIM achieves up to 18% improvement in fairness metrics, reduces privacy attack success rates by 5-9%, and improves robustness against poisoning and noisy-gradient attacks by up to 85% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

This challenge is ubiquitous in fields such as fluid mechanics, seismic inversion, and structural health monitoring. Existing deep and operator-learning models collapse under these conditions: fixed-grid assumptions fail, reconstruction deteriorates sharply, and inversion becomes unreliable with limited robustness and no uncertainty quantification (UQ).We propose the Physical Inversion Solver (PIS), a set-conditioned diffusion framework enabling inversion from truly arbitrary observation sets. PIS employs a Set Transformer-based encoder to handle measurements of any number or geometry, and a cosine-annealed sparsity curriculum for exceptional robustness. An accompanying information-theoretic analysis provides insight into the limits of inversion under extreme sparsity by revealing how observation entropy varies across physical systems.PIS is evaluated on three challenging PDE inverse problems: Darcy flow, wavefield inversion (Helmholtz), and structural health monitoring (Hooke's Law). Across all tasks and sparsity regimes -- including extreme cases with an observation rate of only $0.29\\%$ -- existing operator-learning baselines fail to reconstruct meaningful fields, often diverging or collapsing entirely.In stark contrast, PIS remains stable and accurate, reducing inversion error by $12.28\\%$--$88.73\\%$ and reliably producing calibrated posterior samples. These samples accurately reflect both data scarcity and intrinsic physical ambiguity. These results position PIS as a powerful, general-purpose, and uniquely sparsity-resilient solution for physical inversion under arbitrary and severely undersampled observations."}

This framework encompasses several families of quantum codes, including stabilizer and subsystem codes, provides a natural extension of generalized distances in quantum codes, and yields new invariants that capture local algebraic and combinatorial features.

We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx. 66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx. 40%). We provide a qualitative analysis of the generated proofs, highlighting differences in conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure.

Despite these advancements, a persistent challenge remains--selecting the optimal ranks for each layer to jointly optimise compression rate and downstream task accuracy. Current methods either rely on heuristics that can yield sub-optimal results due to their limited discrete search space or are gradient-based but are not as performant as heuristic approaches without post-compression fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose Learning to Low-Rank Compress (LLRC), a gradient-based approach which directly learns the weights of masks that select singular values in a fine-tuning-free setting. Using a calibration dataset, we train only the mask weights to select fewer and fewer singular values while minimising the divergence of intermediate activations from the original model. Our approach outperforms competing ranking selection methods that similarly require no post-compression fine-tuning across various compression rates on common-sense reasoning and open-domain question-answering tasks. For instance, with a compression rate of 20% on Llama-2-13B, LLRC outperforms the competitive Sensitivity-based Truncation Rank Searching (STRS) on MMLU, BoolQ, and OpenbookQA by 12%, 3.5%, and 4.4%, respectively. Compared to other compression techniques, our approach consistently outperforms fine-tuning-free variants of SVD-LLM and LLM-Pruner across datasets and compression rates. Our fine-tuning-free approach also performs competitively with the fine-tuning variant of LLM-Pruner."}

In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional spin model featuring a tunable long-range hopping term, $H_{n}$, which introduces nonlocal interactions and bridges the gap between Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. Through a systematic analysis of level-spacing statistics, Krylov complexity, and entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that $H_{n}$ acts as a universal control parameter driving the transition from integrability to quantum chaos. Specifically, increasing the strength of $H_{n}$ induces a crossover from Poissonian to Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble statistics in the Hermitian limit, and similarly triggers chaotic dynamics in the non-Hermitian case. Most remarkably, despite the onset of global chaos, we identify a tower of exact nonthermal eigenstates that evade thermalization. These states survive as robust quantum many-body scars, retaining low entanglement and coherent dynamics even under strong non-Hermitian perturbations. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which long-range and non-Hermitian effects reshape quantum ergodicity, offering new pathways for preserving quantum coherence in complex many-body systems."}

An exactly solvable rotating-wave benchmark links generator growth to interference-induced near-zeros of the coherence and shows how the reconstruction regulates the map. Applying the method to the unbiased spin--boson model reveals an emergent transverse measurement primitive: bath memory and counter--rotating terms induce phase lock-in that irreversibly erases the relative phase between $σ_x$ eigenspaces on a finite timescale $t_P$, yielding an effective zero-bias transverse ($σ_x$) measurement channel. The selected transverse basis is not assumed a priori; it follows from the reconstructed reduced dynamics.

However, the standard Top-k routing strategy imposes a uniform sparsity pattern that ignores the varying difficulty of tokens. While Top-p routing offers a flexible alternative, existing implementations typically rely on a fixed global probability threshold, which results in uncontrolled computational costs and sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose DTop-p MoE, a sparsity-controllable dynamic Top-p routing mechanism. To resolve the challenge of optimizing a non-differentiable threshold, we utilize a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller that dynamically adjusts the probability threshold to align the running activated-expert sparsity with a specified target. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic routing normalization mechanism that adapts layer-wise routing logits, allowing different layers to learn distinct expert-selection patterns while utilizing a global probability threshold. Extensive experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers demonstrate that DTop-p consistently outperforms both Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines. Our analysis confirms that DTop-p maintains precise control over the number of activated experts while adaptively allocating resources across different tokens and layers. Furthermore, DTop-p exhibits strong scaling properties with respect to expert granularity, expert capacity, model size, and dataset size, offering a robust framework for large-scale MoE pre-training."}

While existing approaches excel in recognizing the distinct patterns under the low-dimensional scenarios, they often fail to robustly capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies when learning representations from the high-dimensional noisy time series. To address these limitations, we propose DARTs, a robust long short-term dual-path framework with window-aware spatiotemporal soft fusion mechanism, which can be primarily decomposed into three complementary components. Specifically, in the short-term path, we introduce a Multi-View Sparse Graph Learner and a Diffusion Multi-Relation Graph Unit that collaborate to adaptively capture hierarchical discriminative short-term spatiotemporal patterns in the high-noise time series. While in the long-term path, we design a Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Constructor to model salient long-term dynamics within the high-dimensional representation space. Finally, a window-aware spatiotemporal soft-fusion mechanism is introduced to filter the residual noise while seamlessly integrating anomalous patterns. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results across mainstream datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our proposed DARTs. A series of ablation studies are also conducted to explore the crucial design factors of our proposed components. Our code and model will be made publicly open soon."}

However, the process of labeling MDD remains challenging. As a self-supervised learning method, contrastive learning could address the shortcomings of supervised learning methods, which are unduly reliant on labels in the context of MDD detection. However, existing contrastive learning methods are not specifically designed to characterize the time-frequency distribution of EEG signals, and their capacity to acquire low-semantic data representations is still inadequate for MDD detection tasks. To address the problem of contrastive learning method, we propose a time-frequency fusion and multi-domain cross-loss (TF-MCL) model for MDD detection. TF-MCL generates time-frequency hybrid representations through the use of a fusion mapping head (FMH), which efficiently remaps time-frequency domain information to the fusion domain, and thus can effectively enhance the model's capacity to synthesize time-frequency information. Moreover, by optimizing the multi-domain cross-loss function, the distribution of the representations in the time-frequency domain and the fusion domain is reconstructed, thereby improving the model's capacity to acquire fusion representations. We evaluated the performance of our model on the publicly available datasets MODMA and PRED+CT and show a significant improvement in accuracy, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 5.87% and 9.96%, respectively."}

This description is equivalent to assuming that the effective positive-operator-valued measurement (POVM) is diagonal in the measurement basis, and therefore completely insensitive to quantum coherences. We relax this assumption and derive a fully general expression for the observed measurement probabilities under arbitrary completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) noise preceding a computational-basis measurement. Writing the ideal post-circuit stat $\\tildeρ$ in terms of its populations $x$ and coherences $y$, we show that the observed probability vector $z$ satisfies $z = A x + C y$, where $A$ is the familiar classical assignment matrix and $C$ is a coherence-response matrix constructed from the off-diagonal matrix elements of the effective POVM in the computational basis. The classical model $z = A x$ arises if and only if all POVM elements are diagonal; in this sense $C$ quantifies accessible information about coherent readout distortions and interference between computational-basis states, all of which are invisible to models that retain only $A$. This work therefore provides a natural, fully general framework for coherence-sensitive readout modeling on current and future quantum devices."}

However, the substantial computational demand restricts access to LLM almost exclusively through cloud-based service, which makes LLM-based decision support tools impractical for dairy farming. To address this gap, lightweight alternatives capable of running locally on farm hardware are required. In this work, we benchmarked 20 open-source Small Language Models (SLM) available on HuggingFace under farm-realistic computing constraints. Building on our prior work, we developed an agentic AI system that integrates five task-specific agents: literature search, web search, SQL database interaction, NoSQL database interaction, and graph generation following predictive models. Evaluation was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, five test questions were used for the initial screening to identify models capable of following basic dairy-related instructions and performing reliably in a compute-constrained environment. Models that passed this preliminary stage were then evaluated using 30 questions (five per task category mentioned above, plus one category addressing integrity and misconduct) in phase two. In results, Qwen-4B achieved superior performance across most of task categories, although showed unstable effectiveness in NoSQL database interactions through PySpark. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly evaluating the feasibility of SLM as engines for dairy farming decision-making, with central emphases on privacy and computational efficiency.

Current defense strategies often rely on computationally expensive external classifiers or brittle lexical filters, overlooking the intrinsic dynamics of the model's reasoning process. In this work, the Laminar Flow Hypothesis is introduced, which posits that benign inputs induce smooth, gradual transitions in an LLM's high-dimensional latent space, whereas adversarial prompts trigger chaotic, high-variance trajectories - termed Semantic Turbulence - resulting from the internal conflict between safety alignment and instruction-following objectives. This phenomenon is formalized through a novel, zero-shot metric: the variance of layer-wise cosine velocity. Experimental evaluation across diverse small language models reveals a striking diagnostic capability. The RLHF-aligned Qwen2-1.5B exhibits a statistically significant 75.4% increase in turbulence under attack (p less than 0.001), validating the hypothesis of internal conflict. Conversely, Gemma-2B displays a 22.0% decrease in turbulence, characterizing a distinct, low-entropy \"reflex-based\" refusal mechanism. These findings demonstrate that Semantic Turbulence serves not only as a lightweight, real-time jailbreak detector but also as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for categorizing the underlying safety architecture of black-box models."}

By Monte Carlo sampling over circuit topologies, we identify architectures that efficiently generate highly entangled pure states, approaching the GHz limit, and demonstrate a clear advantage of non-linear networks up to 20 qubits. For the noisy scenario, we employ the experimentally accessible Meyer-Wallach global entanglement as a surrogate optimization cost and certify entanglement using bipartite negativity. For mixed states of up to ten qubits, the optimized circuits generate substantial entanglement across both symmetric and asymmetric bipartitions. These results establish an experimentally motivated and scalable variational framework for engineering multipartite entanglement on near-term quantum devices, highlighting the combined role of non-linearity and circuit topology."}

Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings. Furthermore, ICoT outperforms six existing prompting baselines on challenging benchmarks."}

Experimental results identify a substantial gap between validation and test performance, with models performing worse than trivial baselines despite strong validation metrics.

Practical application is illustrated through weekly sentiment aggregation and narrative summarization for market monitoring workflows. The findings offer empirical evidence that embedding quality alone cannot address fundamental data scarcity in sentiment classification.

Prior work showed that a metric known as the one-tangling power can be used to quantify the entanglement dynamics of sparse systems of spin-1/2 nuclei coupled to color centers in diamond and SiC.

Focusing on the example of an (In)GaAs QD, we offer a procedure for pinpointing physically realistic parameter regimes that yield maximal entanglement between the central electron and surrounding nuclei. We further harness knowledge of naturally-occurring degeneracies and the tunability of the system to generate maximal entanglement between target subsets of spins when the QD electron is subject to dynamical decoupling. We also leverage the one-tangling power as an exact and immediate method for computing QD electron spin dephasing times with and without the application of spin echo sequences, and use our analysis to identify coherence-sustaining conditions within the system."}

This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets.

We introduce Memory-Infused Depth Up-Scaling (MIDUS), which replaces FFNs in duplicated blocks with a head-wise memory (HML) layer. Motivated by observations that attention heads have distinct roles both across and within layers, MIDUS assigns an independent memory bank to each head, enabling head-wise retrieval and injecting information into subsequent layers while preserving head-wise functional structure. This design combines sparse memory access with head-wise representations and incorporates an efficient per-head value factorization module, thereby relaxing the usual efficiency-performance trade-off.

The proposed algorithm exhibits two transformative advantages. First, for the computation of physical observables, its sampling error is independent of the semiclassical parameter $\\varepsilon$, thus fundamentally breaking the prohibitive computational scaling faced by grid methods in the semiclassical limit. Second, its mesh-free nature entirely eliminates the boundary-induced instabilities that constrain long-time grid-based simulations. Leveraging these capabilities, the FGS algorithm serves as a powerful investigatory tool for exploring the long-time behavior of open quantum systems.

In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional spin model featuring a tunable long-range hopping term, $H_{n}$, which introduces nonlocal interactions and bridges the gap between Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. Through a systematic analysis of level-spacing statistics, Krylov complexity, and entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that $H_{n}$ acts as a universal control parameter driving the transition from integrability to quantum chaos. Specifically, increasing the strength of $H_{n}$ induces a crossover from Poissonian to Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble statistics in the Hermitian limit, and similarly triggers chaotic dynamics in the non-Hermitian case. Most remarkably, despite the onset of global chaos, we identify a tower of exact nonthermal eigenstates that evade thermalization. These states survive as robust quantum many-body scars, retaining low entanglement and coherent dynamics even under strong non-Hermitian perturbations. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which long-range and non-Hermitian effects reshape quantum ergodicity, offering new pathways for preserving quantum coherence in complex many-body systems."}

To address this, we propose MV-SupGCN, a semi-supervised GCN model that integrates several complementary components with clear motivations and mutual reinforcement.

Our discussion will include a full development of the mathematics of identical particles and the mechanics of describing systems of identical particles in both first and second quantization schemes. This chapter is an offshoot of a larger work that provides a graduate-level introduction to quantum information science. This chapter is being released separately because it is not explicitly focused on quantum information. It has grown beyond a short digression into a full-fledged journey into the symmetries and representations of identical particles that we invite you, the reader, to join."}

HydroGEM uses two-stage training: self-supervised pretraining on 6.03 million sequences from 3,724 USGS stations learns hydrological representations, followed by fine-tuning with synthetic anomalies for detection and reconstruction. A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods. Zero-shot transfer to 100 Environment and Climate Change Canada stations yields F1 = 0.586, exceeding all baselines and demonstrating cross-national generalization. The model maintains consistent detection across correction magnitudes and aligns with operational seasonal patterns. HydroGEM is designed for human-in-the-loop workflows - outputs are quality control suggestions requiring expert review, not autonomous corrections."}

We study constrained policy learning where model parameters must satisfy unknown, rollout-based safety constraints. We propose SCPO, a sampling-based weight-space projection method that enforces safety directly in parameter space without requiring gradient access to the constraint functions. Our approach constructs a local safe region by combining trajectory rollouts with smoothness bounds that relate parameter changes to shifts in safety metrics. Each gradient update is then projected via a convex SOCP, producing a safe first-order step. We establish a safe-by-induction guarantee: starting from any safe initialization, all intermediate policies remain safe given feasible projections. In constrained control settings with a stabilizing backup policy, our approach further ensures closed-loop stability and enables safe adaptation beyond the conservative backup. On regression with harmful supervision and a constrained double-integrator task with malicious expert, our approach consistently rejects unsafe updates, maintains feasibility throughout training, and achieves meaningful primal objective improvement."}

It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should strive for, not a descriptive \"law of nature.\" Second, all probabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they never tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum states thus have no \"ontic hold\" on the world, which implies a more radical kind of indeterminism in quantum theory than other interpretations understand. Third, quantum measurement outcomes just are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them. Thus all quantum measurement outcomes are local in the sense of the agent enacting them. Through these tenets, we explain four points better than previously: 1) how QBism contrasts with Bohr's concern over unambiguous language, 2) how QBism contrasts with the Everett interpretation, 3) how QBism understands the meaning of Bell inequality violations, and 4) how QBism responds to Wigner's \"suspended animation\" argument. Finally, we consider the ontological lesson of the tenets and ask what it might mean for the next one hundred years of quantum theory and humankind more generally."}

However, despite the convincing benchmark performance, successful translation to real applications is limited. The frequent disconnect between performance on controlled BCI benchmarks and its lack of generalisation to practical settings indicates hidden overfitting problems. We introduce Disentangled Decoding Decomposition (D3), a weakly supervised method for training deep learning models across EEG datasets. By predicting the place in the respective trial sequence from which the input window was sampled, EEG-D3 separates latent components of brain activity, akin to non-linear ICA. We utilise a novel model architecture with fully independent sub-networks for strict interpretability. We outline a feature interpretation paradigm to contrast the component activation profiles on different datasets and inspect the associated temporal and spatial filters. The proposed method reliably separates latent components of brain activity on motor imagery data. Training downstream classifiers on an appropriate subset of these components prevents hidden overfitting caused by task-correlated artefacts, which severely affects end-to-end classifiers. We further exploit the linearly separable latent space for effective few-shot learning on sleep stage classification. The ability to distinguish genuine components of brain activity from spurious features results in models that avoid the hidden overfitting problem and generalise well to real-world applications, while requiring only minimal labelled data. With interest to the neuroscience community, the proposed method gives researchers a tool to separate individual brain processes and potentially even uncover heretofore unknown dynamics."}

The $ω$ and $κ$ sweeps confirm that curvature and not the choice of control parameter determines the behaviour of the system. This gives the trapped-ion platform a clear advantage that the curvature can be engineered without altering the harmonic characteristics of the system. The interplay between $ω$ and $κ$ thus provides a practical route for precision quantum control and offers Information-theoretic framework for experiments that probe confinement, quantization scale, and information flow in engineered ion traps."}

We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation.

Our approach introduces the Adversarial Robustness Quotient (ARQ), which quantifies the computational cost of verification relative to baseline generation, demonstrating exponential growth with orbit size.

Typically, the theoretical modeling has been conducted in the Schrödinger picture, where results are only obtainable under certain approximations, while, in contrast, the Heisenberg picture has remained relatively unexplored. In this work, we develop an accurately controlled perturbative expansion of the time-evolution operator in the Heisenberg picture and derive beyond-semiclassical corrections to the emitter dynamics due to the coupling to the quantized electromagnetic field, capturing effects of the quantum fluctuations present in the latter. We focus on high-order harmonic generation (HHG), where the approach is accurate in parameter regimes of current interest and it gives closed-form expressions for key observables. This formulation not only simplifies numerical calculations compared to the Schrödinger-picture approach but also provides a clear correspondence between nonclassical features of the emitted light and the underlying induced dynamics of the generating medium including quantum fluctuations. Moreover, the Heisenberg framework naturally yields scaling relations with the number of independent emitters, enabling us to assess whether nonclassical behavior should persist under typical experimental conditions involving large emitter ensembles. Interestingly, we find that the degree of squeezing increases with the number of emitters, whereas the photon statistics approaches a classical Poissonian distribution in the many-emitter limit. We also find that the beyond-semiclassical emitter dynamics significantly enhances the degree of squeezing of the emitted light. Our work advances the theoretical understanding of quantum-optical HHG and introduces an accessible and well-controlled framework to describe realistic experiments."}

However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages. Our approach outperforms existing baselines with an average, across datasets, of 65% of records within a 10 km radius, for a fixed amount of training data. The best results (New York state) were 85% within 10km and 67% within 1km. The selected LLM performs well for lengthy, complex descriptions, highlighting its potential for georeferencing intricate locality descriptions."}

In this paper, we investigate whether this human improvement strategy can be applied to improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for alignment of language models (LMs). In particular, it is observed in the literature that LMs tuned by RLHF can still output unsatisfactory responses. This paper proposes a method to improve the unsatisfactory responses by correcting their causes. Our method has two parts. The first part proposes a post-hoc explanation method to explain why an unsatisfactory response is generated to a prompt by identifying the training data that lead to this response. We formulate this problem as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to find a set of training data closest to this prompt-response pair in a feature representation space, and the constraint is that the prompt-response pair can be decomposed as a convex combination of this set of training data in the feature space. We propose an efficient iterative data selection algorithm to solve this problem. The second part proposes an unlearning method that improves unsatisfactory responses to some prompts by unlearning the training data that lead to these unsatisfactory responses and, meanwhile, does not significantly degrade satisfactory responses to other prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can improve RLHF."}

A crucial component of QNNs is the encoder, which maps classical input data into quantum states. However, choosing suitable encoders remains a significant challenge, largely due to the lack of systematic guidance and the trial-and-error nature of current approaches. This process is further impeded by two key challenges: (1) the difficulty in evaluating encoded quantum states prior to training, and (2) the lack of intuitive methods for analyzing an encoder's ability to effectively distinguish data features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel visualization tool, XQAI-Eyes, which enables QNN developers to compare classical data features with their corresponding encoded quantum states and to examine the mixed quantum states across different classes. By bridging classical and quantum perspectives, XQAI-Eyes facilitates a deeper understanding of how encoders influence QNN performance. Evaluations across diverse datasets and encoder designs demonstrate XQAI-Eyes's potential to support the exploration of the relationship between encoder design and QNN effectiveness, offering a holistic and transparent approach to optimizing quantum encoders. Moreover, domain experts used XQAI-Eyes to derive two key practices for quantum encoder selection, grounded in the principles of pattern preservation and feature mapping."}

Here, we explore the DTC in a disorder-free, periodically kicked XXZ spin chain, which is stabilized by the Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation. We numerically show the period-doubling response of the conventional DTC order, and uncover a multiple-period response with beating dynamics due to the coherent interplay of multiple $π$-pairs in the Floquet spectrum of small-size systems. The lifetime of the DTC order exhibits independence of the driving frequency and a power-law dependence on the ZZ interaction strength. It also grows exponentially with the system size, as a hallmark of the strong fragmentation inherent to the Floquet model. We analytically reveal the approximate conservation of the magnetization and domain-wall number in the Floquet operator for the emergent strong fragmentation, which is consistent with numerical results of the dimensionality ratio of symmetry subspaces. The rigidity and phase regime of the DTC order are identified through finite-size scaling of the Floquet-spectrum-averaged mutual information, as well as via dynamical probes. Our work establishes the Floquet Hilbert space fragmentation as a disorder-free mechanism for sustaining nontrivial temporal orders in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems."}

The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.\n  Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.\n  X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.\n  Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement. This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.\n  Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD.

The process of removing connections from a network at random is similar to percolation, a paradigm model of statistical physics.\n  If dropout were to remove enough connections such that there is no path between the input and output of the NN, then the NN could not make predictions informed by the data. We study new percolation models that mimic dropout in NNs and characterise the relationship between network topology and this path problem. The theory shows the existence of a percolative effect in dropout. We also show that this percolative effect can cause a breakdown when training NNs without biases with dropout; and we argue heuristically that this breakdown extends to NNs with biases."}

The so-called exponential backlog problem that can arise when one has to do logical $T$-gates within the surface code demands real-time decoding of the syndrome information to diagnose the appropriate Pauli frame in which to do the gate. This in turn puts a minimum requirement on the communication rate between the quantum processing unit, where the syndrome information is collected, and the classical processor, where the decoding algorithm is run. This minimum communication rate can be difficult to achieve while preserving the quality of the quantum processor. Here, we present two decoders that make use of a reduced syndrome information volume, relying on a number of syndrome bits that scale only as the width -- and not the usual area -- of the surface-code patch. This eases the communication requirements necessary for real-time decoding."}

This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing.

However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions.

One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement. On an NVIDIA H100, OPTIMA prunes a 8B-parameter transformer end-to-end in 40 hours with 60GB peak memory. Together, these results set a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for one-shot post-training pruning."}

The protocol involves creating a maximally entangled n--qubit state, encoding the classical message with Pauli--Z and Pauli--X gates, and then transmitting and decoding the message via quantum communication, quantum operations, and measurements. The key novelty of this work lies in the proposed n--bit encoding routine, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first explicit and scalable recipe for constructing quantum circuits for n--bit Superdense Coding, minimizing errors through a simple circuit design. The protocol was tested on real quantum hardware using Qiskit 2.0 and the IBM--Torino quantum computer for message lengths of 4, 6, 8, and 10 bits. Results show that success rates decrease as message length, circuit depth, and gate count increase, largely due to increased Pauli--X gate usage for messages with more ``1\" bits.

However, empirical evidence suggests that such long-context LLMs can consume far more text than they can reliably use. On the other hand, it has been shown that inference-time compute can be used to scale performance of LLMs, often by generating thinking tokens, on challenging tasks involving multi-step reasoning. Through controlled experiments on sandbox long-context tasks, we find that such inference-time strategies show rapidly diminishing returns and fail at long context. We attribute these failures to score dilution, a phenomenon inherent to static self-attention. Further, we show that current inference-time strategies cannot retrieve relevant long-context signals under certain conditions. We propose a simple method that, through targeted gradient updates on the given context, provably overcomes limitations of static self-attention. We find that this shift in how inference-time compute is spent leads to consistently large performance improvements across models and long-context benchmarks. Our method leads to large 12.6 and 14.1 percentage point improvements for Qwen3-4B on average across subsets of LongBench-v2 and ZeroScrolls benchmarks. The takeaway is practical: for long context, a small amount of context-specific training is a better use of inference compute than current inference-time scaling strategies like producing more thinking tokens."}

We discover that the principal eigenvalue governing nonlocality is rigorously dictated by a low-dimensional manifold parameterized by merely two fundamental angular variables, $θ$ and $φ$, whose symmetry leads to further simplification. This geometric distillation establishes a precise mapping connecting external control parameters directly to optimal measurement configurations. Crucially, a comparative analysis of the geometric angles against the principal eigenvalue spectrum, including its magnitude, susceptibility, and nonlocal gap, reveals a fundamental dichotomy in quantum criticality. While transitions involving symmetry sector rotation manifest as geometric criticality with drastic operator reorientation, transitions dominated by strong anisotropy exhibit geometric locking, where the optimal basis remains robust despite clear signatures of phase transitions in the spectral indicators. This distinction offers a novel structural classification of quantum phase transitions and provides a precision navigation chart for Bell experiments."}

Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \\emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \\emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \\emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines \"minimal sufficient sets\" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains."}

Accurate precipitation forecasts are vital for society. Reliable predictions help communities mitigate climatic impacts. Based on the current relevance of artificial intelligence (AI), classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been used as an alternative or complement to dynamic modeling. However, there is still a lack of broad investigations into the feasibility of purely data-driven approaches for precipitation forecasting. This study aims at addressing this issue where different classical ML and DL approaches for forecasting precipitation in South America, taking into account all 2019 seasons, are considered in a detailed investigation. The selected classical ML techniques were Random Forests and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), while the DL counterparts were a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN 1D), a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. Additionally, the Brazilian Global Atmospheric Model (BAM) was used as a representative of the traditional dynamic modeling approach. We also relied on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to provide some explanations for the models behaviors. LSTM showed strong predictive performance while BAM, the traditional dynamic model representative, had the worst results. Despite presented the higher latency, LSTM was most accurate for heavy precipitation. If cost is a concern, XGBoost offers lower latency with slightly accuracy loss. The results of this research confirm the viability of DL models for climate forecasting, solidifying a global trend in major meteorological and climate forecasting centers."}

While the global quantum state remains coherent, the observer's local reality becomes singular and definite. This work introduces reality steering, a protocol that allows an observer to probabilistically access a different reality already supported by the initial quantum state, without reversing decoherence on the environment. The mechanism relies on locally erasing the 'which-outcome' information stored in the observer's brain. Here, 'local' means operations confined to the observer's memory, excluding the environment, which may be cosmically large. Reality steering nevertheless faces intrinsic constraints: successful navigation requires coherent participation from the observer's counterparts across the relevant branches, and any transition is operationally indistinguishable from non-transition. After arriving in a new reality, all memory records are perfectly consistent with that reality, leaving no internal evidence that a switch occurred. This makes conscious confirmation impossible within standard quantum mechanics. We show that nonlinear operations beyond the standard theory could, in principle, enable verifiable and deliberate navigation. Our results shift multi-reality exploration from philosophical speculation toward a concrete -- though fundamentally constrained -- quantum-informational framework."}

Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains.

Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter."}

Recently, a new approach has been proposed in the form of a quantum thermodynamic gauge theory, where the notion of redundant information arises from a group of physically motivated gauge transformations called the thermodynamic group. In this work, we explore the geometrical structure of quantum thermodynamics. Particularly, we do so by explicitly constructing the relevant principal fibre bundle. We then show that there are two distinct (albeit related) geometric structures associated with the gauge theory of quantum thermodynamics. In this way, we express thermodynamics in the same mathematical (geometric) language as the fundamental theories of physics.

Understanding the effect of hardware noise on these experiments is crucial to distinguish errors that have low impact, errors that can be mitigated, and errors that must be reduced at the hardware level. We ran a state preparation and energy measurement protocol on an ion-trap quantum computer, without any non-scalable off-loading of computational tasks to classical computers, and show that leakage errors are the main obstacle to chemical accuracy. More specifically, we apply adiabatic state preparation to prepare the ground state of a six-qubit encoding of the H3+ molecule and extract its energy using a noise-resilient variant of iterative quantum phase estimation. Our results improve upon the classical Hartree-Fock energy. Analyzing the effect of hardware noise on the result, we find that while coherent and incoherent noise have little influence, the hardware results are mainly impacted by leakage errors. Absent leakage errors, noisy numerical simulations show that with our experimental settings we would have achieved close to chemical accuracy, even shot noise included. These insights highlight the importance of targeting leakage suppression in future algorithm and hardware development."}

Two leading methods in solving the ground state problem are the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) algorithms. VQE often struggles with convergence due to the energy landscape being highly non-convex and the existence of barren plateaux, and implementing AQC is beyond the capabilities of current quantum devices as it requires deep circuits. Adiabatically-inspired algorithms aim to fill this gap. In this paper, we first present a unifying framework for these algorithms and then benchmark the following methods: the Adiabatically Assisted VQE (AAVQE) (Garcia-Saez and Latorre (2018)), the Variational Adiabatic Quantum Computing (VAQC) (Harwood et al (2022)), and the Adiabatic Quantum Computing with Parametrized Quantum Circuits (AQC-PQC) (Kolotouros et al (2025)) algorithms.

Third, we compare the accuracy of the methods for chemistry applications using the beryllium hydride molecule (BeH$_2$). We compare the approaches across a number of different choices (ansätze types, depth, discretization steps, initial Hamiltonian, adiabatic schedules and method used). Our results show that the G-AQC-PQC outperforms conventional VQE. We further discuss limitations such as the zero-gradient problem and identify regimes where adiabatically-inspired methods offer a tangible advantage for near-term quantum chemistry applications."}

Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy."}

Typically, BO iteratively updates a probabilistic surrogate model of this mapping and optimizes acquisition functions derived from the model to guide molecule selection.

Large language models (LLMs) and chemistry foundation models offer rich priors to enhance BO, but high-dimensional features, costly in-context learning, and the computational burden of deep Bayesian surrogates hinder their full utilization. To address these challenges, we propose a likelihood-free BO method that bypasses explicit surrogate modeling and directly leverages priors from general LLMs and chemistry-specific foundation models to inform acquisition functions. Our method also learns a tree-structured partition of the molecular search space with local acquisition functions, enabling efficient candidate selection via Monte Carlo Tree Search. By further incorporating coarse-grained LLM-based clustering, it substantially improves scalability to large candidate sets by restricting acquisition function evaluations to clusters with statistically higher property values. We show through extensive experiments and ablations that the proposed method substantially improves scalability, robustness, and sample efficiency in LLM-guided BO for molecular discovery."}

This scaling is directly observable in the single-photon scattering spectrum, enabling the detection of minute changes in atomic separation with a figure of merit that scales as $ N^3 $. The quantum Fisher information (QFI) scales as $N^6$ and can be closely approached by measuring spectral shifts near the steepest slope of the most subradiant resonance. These enhancements remain robust under realistic positional disorder, confirming that dipole--dipole-engineered subradiance provides a viable resource for quantum metrology.

Further for strictly non-interacting Hamiltonian, the direct relationship between ergotropy and correlations is established.

In clinical practice, EEG data are often scarce, patient-specific distributed across institutions, and governed by strict privacy regulations that prohibit data pooling. As a result, creating usable AI-based seizure detection models remains challenging in real-world medical settings. To address these constraints, we propose a two-stage federated few-shot learning (FFSL) framework for personalized EEG-based seizure detection. The method is trained and evaluated on the TUH Event Corpus, which includes six EEG event classes. In Stage 1, a pretrained biosignal transformer (BIOT) is fine-tuned across non-IID simulated hospital sites using federated learning, enabling shared representation learning without centralizing EEG recordings. In Stage 2, federated few-shot personalization adapts the classifier to each patient using only five labeled EEG segments, retaining seizure-specific information while still benefiting from cross-site knowledge. Federated fine-tuning achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.43 (centralized: 0.52), Cohen's kappa of 0.42 (0.49), and weighted F1 of 0.69 (0.74). In the FFSL stage, client-specific models reached an average balanced accuracy of 0.77, Cohen's kappa of 0.62, and weighted F1 of 0.73 across four sites with heterogeneous event distributions. These results suggest that FFSL can support effective patient-adaptive seizure detection under realistic data-availability and privacy constraints."}

In this work we present a new approach to such crystallographic symmetries by developing a single machine learning architecture that is capable of adapting its weights automatically to enforce invariance to any input space group. Our approach is based on constructing symmetry-adapted Fourier bases through an explicit characterization of constraints that group operations impose on Fourier coefficients. Encoding these constraints into a neural network layer enables weight sharing across different space groups, allowing the model to leverage structural similarities between groups and overcome data sparsity when limited measurements are available for specific groups. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving competitive performance on material property prediction tasks and performing zero-shot learning to generalize to unseen groups."}

Existing approaches typically model MTS data in either Euclidean or Riemannian space, limiting their ability to capture the diverse geometric structures and complex spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in real-world data. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Hybrid Symmetric Positive-Definite Manifold Graph Neural Network (HSMGNN), a novel graph neural network-based model that captures data geometry within a hybrid Euclidean-Riemannian framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage hybrid geometric representations for MTS forecasting, enabling expressive and comprehensive modeling of geometric properties. Specifically, we introduce a Submanifold-Cross-Segment (SCS) embedding to project input MTS into both Euclidean and Riemannian spaces, thereby capturing spatio-temporal variations across distinct geometric domains. To alleviate the high computational cost of Riemannian distance, we further design an Adaptive-Distance-Bank (ADB) layer with a trainable memory mechanism. Finally, a Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (FGCN) is devised to integrate features from the dual spaces via a learnable fusion operator for accurate prediction. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that HSMGNN achieves up to a 13.8 percent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in forecasting accuracy."}

The execution of a circuit, however, depends on internal allocation and routing policies that are not observable to the user. A provider may redirect jobs to more error-prone regions to conserve resources, balance load or for other opaque reasons, causing degradation in fidelity while still presenting stale or averaged calibration data. This lack of transparency creates a security gap: users cannot verify whether their circuits were executed on the hardware for which they were charged. Forensic methods that infer backend behavior from user-visible artifacts are therefore becoming essential. In this work, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based forensic framework that predicts per-qubit and per-qubit link error rates of an unseen backend using only topology information and aggregated features extracted from transpiled circuits. We construct a dataset from several IBM 27-qubit devices, merge static calibration features with dynamic transpilation features and train separate GNN regressors for one- and two-qubit errors. At inference time, the model operates without access to calibration data from the target backend and reconstructs a complete error map from the features available to the user. Our results on the target backend show accurate recovery of backend error rate, with an average mismatch of approximately 22% for single-qubit errors and 18% for qubit-link errors. The model also exhibits strong ranking agreement, with the ordering induced by predicted error values closely matching that of the actual calibration errors, as reflected by high Spearman correlation. The framework consistently identifies weak links and high-noise qubits and remains robust under realistic temporal noise drift."}

This challenge is ubiquitous in fields such as fluid mechanics, seismic inversion, and structural health monitoring. Existing deep and operator-learning models collapse under these conditions: fixed-grid assumptions fail, reconstruction deteriorates sharply, and inversion becomes unreliable with limited robustness and no uncertainty quantification (UQ).We propose the Physical Inversion Solver (PIS), a set-conditioned diffusion framework enabling inversion from truly arbitrary observation sets. PIS employs a Set Transformer-based encoder to handle measurements of any number or geometry, and a cosine-annealed sparsity curriculum for exceptional robustness. An accompanying information-theoretic analysis provides insight into the limits of inversion under extreme sparsity by revealing how observation entropy varies across physical systems.PIS is evaluated on three challenging PDE inverse problems: Darcy flow, wavefield inversion (Helmholtz), and structural health monitoring (Hooke's Law). Across all tasks and sparsity regimes -- including extreme cases with an observation rate of only $0.29\\%$ -- existing operator-learning baselines fail to reconstruct meaningful fields, often diverging or collapsing entirely.In stark contrast, PIS remains stable and accurate, reducing inversion error by $12.28\\%$--$88.73\\%$ and reliably producing calibrated posterior samples.

Existing approaches are often tailored to single tasks or specific data types, making it difficult to simultaneously handle multi-task modeling and effectively integrate information across diverse time series types. Moreover, real-world data are often affected by noise, complex frequency components, and multi-scale dynamic patterns, which further complicate robust feature extraction and analysis.

FusAD features an adaptive time-frequency fusion mechanism, integrating both Fourier and Wavelet transforms to efficiently capture global-local and multi-scale dynamic features. With an adaptive denoising mechanism, FusAD automatically senses and filters various types of noise, highlighting crucial sequence variations and enabling robust feature extraction in complex environments.

Evaluations on 2--5 qubit systems and arbitrary-dimensional states show PINN consistently outperforms traditional neural networks (TNNs), achieving highest fidelity across all dimensions. PINN outperforms baselines, with marked improvements in moderately high-dimensional systems, superior noise robustness (slower performance degradation), and consistent dimensional robustness. Theoretical analysis shows physical constraints reduce Rademacher complexity and mitigate the curse of dimensionality via constraint-induced dimension and sample complexity reduction, effective regardless of qubit number.

Despite these advancements, a persistent challenge remains--selecting the optimal ranks for each layer to jointly optimise compression rate and downstream task accuracy. Current methods either rely on heuristics that can yield sub-optimal results due to their limited discrete search space or are gradient-based but are not as performant as heuristic approaches without post-compression fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose Learning to Low-Rank Compress (LLRC), a gradient-based approach which directly learns the weights of masks that select singular values in a fine-tuning-free setting. Using a calibration dataset, we train only the mask weights to select fewer and fewer singular values while minimising the divergence of intermediate activations from the original model. Our approach outperforms competing ranking selection methods that similarly require no post-compression fine-tuning across various compression rates on common-sense reasoning and open-domain question-answering tasks. For instance, with a compression rate of 20% on Llama-2-13B, LLRC outperforms the competitive Sensitivity-based Truncation Rank Searching (STRS) on MMLU, BoolQ, and OpenbookQA by 12%, 3.5%, and 4.4%, respectively.

Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel \"token rounding\" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE.

While quantum optimization heuristics such as quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) are known to induce biased sampling, hybrid quantum-classical MCMC incorporates quantum dynamics only as a proposal transition and enforces detailed balance through classical acceptance steps. Using small Ising models, we show that MCMC post-processing corrects the sampling bias of quantum dynamics and restores near-uniform sampling over degenerate ground states. We then apply the method to random $k$-SAT problems near the satisfiability threshold. For random 2-SAT, a hybrid MCMC combining QAOA-assisted neural proposals with single spin-flip updates achieves fairness comparable to that of PT-ICM. For random 3-SAT, where such classical methods are no longer applicable, the hybrid MCMC still attains approximately uniform sampling. We also examine solution counting and find that the required number of transitions is comparable to that of WalkSAT. These results indicate that hybrid quantum-classical MCMC provides a viable framework for fair sampling and solution enumeration."}

As a result, a DIFNO can closely emulate not only the high-fidelity operator's response but also its sensitivities. To motivate the use of DIFNOs instead of conventional FNOs as surrogate models, we show that accurate surrogate-driven PDE-constrained optimization requires accurate surrogate Fréchet derivatives. Then, for continuously differentiable operators, we establish (i) simultaneous universal approximation of FNOs and their Fréchet derivatives on compact sets, and (ii) universal approximation of FNOs in weighted Sobolev spaces with input measures that have unbounded supports. Our theoretical results certify the capability of FNOs for accurate derivative-informed operator learning and accurate solution of PDE-constrained optimization. Furthermore, we develop efficient training schemes using dimension reduction and multi-resolution techniques that significantly reduce memory and computational costs for Fréchet derivative learning.

This forms a new type of attack on the economics of cloud-based quantum computers. All major quantum computing companies today offer access to their hardware through some type of cloud-based service. Due to the noisy nature of quantum computers, a quantum circuit is run many times to collect the output statistics, and each run is called a shot. The fees users pay for access to the machines typically depend on the number of these shots of a quantum circuit that are executed. Per-shot pricing is a clean and straightforward approach as users are charged a small fee for each shot of their circuit. This work demonstrates that per-shot pricing can be exploited to get circuits to run for free when users abuse recently implemented mid-circuit qubit measurement and reset operations. Through evaluation on real, cloud-based quantum computers this work shows how multiple circuits can be executed together within a shot, by separating each user circuit by set of reset operations and submitting all the circuits, and reset operations, as one larger circuit. As a result, the user is charged per-shot pricing, even though inside each shot are multiple circuits. Total per-shot cost to run certain circuits could be reduced by up to $900$\\% using methods proposed in this work, leading to significant financial losses to quantum computing companies.

However, the process of labeling MDD remains challenging. As a self-supervised learning method, contrastive learning could address the shortcomings of supervised learning methods, which are unduly reliant on labels in the context of MDD detection. However, existing contrastive learning methods are not specifically designed to characterize the time-frequency distribution of EEG signals, and their capacity to acquire low-semantic data representations is still inadequate for MDD detection tasks. To address the problem of contrastive learning method, we propose a time-frequency fusion and multi-domain cross-loss (TF-MCL) model for MDD detection. TF-MCL generates time-frequency hybrid representations through the use of a fusion mapping head (FMH), which efficiently remaps time-frequency domain information to the fusion domain, and thus can effectively enhance the model's capacity to synthesize time-frequency information. Moreover, by optimizing the multi-domain cross-loss function, the distribution of the representations in the time-frequency domain and the fusion domain is reconstructed, thereby improving the model's capacity to acquire fusion representations.

In many practical schemes, the initial qubit configuration has to be inferred from readout that is a time-dependent weak measurement record. However, a combination of the measurement scheme and intrinsic dynamics can end up scrambling the initial state and lose information irretrievably. Here, we study the information physics of quantum trajectories based on weak measurements in order to address the optimal achievable performance in qubit configuration readout for two realistic models of single qubit readout: (i) Model I is informationally complete, but without intrinsic dynamics; (ii) Model II is informationally incomplete weak measurements with intrinsic dynamics. We first use mutual information to characterize how much intrinsic information about the initial state is encoded in the measurement record. Using a fixed discrete time-step formulation, we compute the mutual information while varying the measurement strength, duration of measurement record, and the relative strength of intrinsic dynamics in our measurement schemes. We also exploit the emergence of continuum scaling and the Stochastic Master Equation in the weak measurement limit. We develop an asymptotic expansion in the measurement efficiency parameter to calculate mutual information, which captures qualitative and quantitative features of the numerical data. The bounds on information extraction are manifested as plateaux in mutual information, our analysis obtains these bounds and also optimal duration of measurement required to saturate them.

Current defense strategies often rely on computationally expensive external classifiers or brittle lexical filters, overlooking the intrinsic dynamics of the model's reasoning process. In this work, the Laminar Flow Hypothesis is introduced, which posits that benign inputs induce smooth, gradual transitions in an LLM's high-dimensional latent space, whereas adversarial prompts trigger chaotic, high-variance trajectories - termed Semantic Turbulence - resulting from the internal conflict between safety alignment and instruction-following objectives. This phenomenon is formalized through a novel, zero-shot metric: the variance of layer-wise cosine velocity. Experimental evaluation across diverse small language models reveals a striking diagnostic capability. The RLHF-aligned Qwen2-1.5B exhibits a statistically significant 75.4% increase in turbulence under attack (p less than 0.001), validating the hypothesis of internal conflict. Conversely, Gemma-2B displays a 22.0% decrease in turbulence, characterizing a distinct, low-entropy \"reflex-based\" refusal mechanism.

S-GRPO incorporates an additional supervised component and jointly optimizes the generation term, KL-divergence regularization, and label-based objective during training.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that S-GRPO consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both performance and robustness. Furthermore, it extends existing preference-learning frameworks such as GRPO and DPO, offering a more flexible and task-adaptive approach to alignment training.

This paper identifies three key issues: (1) passive environmental modeling that overlooks transmitters and key environmental features; (2) overemphasis on single-transmitter scenarios despite real-world multi-transmitter prevalence; (3) excessive focus on in-distribution performance while neglecting distribution shift challenges. To address these, we propose PathFinder, a novel architecture that actively models buildings and transmitters via disentangled feature encoding and integrates Mask-Guided Low-rank Attention to independently focus on receiver and building regions.

We introduce Memory-Infused Depth Up-Scaling (MIDUS), which replaces FFNs in duplicated blocks with a head-wise memory (HML) layer. Motivated by observations that attention heads have distinct roles both across and within layers, MIDUS assigns an independent memory bank to each head, enabling head-wise retrieval and injecting information into subsequent layers while preserving head-wise functional structure. This design combines sparse memory access with head-wise representations and incorporates an efficient per-head value factorization module, thereby relaxing the usual efficiency-performance trade-off.

In this paper, we first reveal that PGD is actually a specific reformulation of the projected gradient method using only the current gradient to determine its step-size. Further, we show that when we utilize a conventional adaptive matrix with the accumulated gradients to scale the perturbation, PGD becomes AdaGrad. Motivated by this analysis, we present a novel momentum-based attack AdaMI, in which the perturbation is optimized with an interesting momentum-based adaptive matrix. AdaMI is proved to attain optimal convergence for convex problems, indicating that it addresses the non-convergence issue of MI-FGSM, thereby ensuring stability of the optimization process. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed momentum-based adaptive matrix can serve as a general and effective technique to boost adversarial transferability over the state-of-the-art methods across different networks while maintaining better stability and imperceptibility."}

Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter."}

As case studies, we consider two models: the antiferromagnetic Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions. We calculate the ground state of these Hamiltonians with SSD using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm and evaluate the local transverse magnetization. For the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the quantum critical point can be accurately estimated by our procedure with systems of up to 84 sites, or even smaller, in good agreement with results from the literature. For the long-range model, we find that the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is slightly shifted relative to the nearest-neighbor case, leading to a reduced region of antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, we propose an experimental procedure to implement the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising couplings with SSD using Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers, which can be achieved within a very good approximation. Because multiple independent scaling conditions naturally emerge, our approach enables precise determination of quantum critical points and possibly even the extraction of additional critical phenomena, such as critical exponents, from relatively small system sizes."}

The frequent disconnect between performance on controlled BCI benchmarks and its lack of generalisation to practical settings indicates hidden overfitting problems. We introduce Disentangled Decoding Decomposition (D3), a weakly supervised method for training deep learning models across EEG datasets. By predicting the place in the respective trial sequence from which the input window was sampled, EEG-D3 separates latent components of brain activity, akin to non-linear ICA. We utilise a novel model architecture with fully independent sub-networks for strict interpretability. We outline a feature interpretation paradigm to contrast the component activation profiles on different datasets and inspect the associated temporal and spatial filters. The proposed method reliably separates latent components of brain activity on motor imagery data. Training downstream classifiers on an appropriate subset of these components prevents hidden overfitting caused by task-correlated artefacts, which severely affects end-to-end classifiers. We further exploit the linearly separable latent space for effective few-shot learning on sleep stage classification. The ability to distinguish genuine components of brain activity from spurious features results in models that avoid the hidden overfitting problem and generalise well to real-world applications, while requiring only minimal labelled data. With interest to the neuroscience community, the proposed method gives researchers a tool to separate individual brain processes and potentially even uncover heretofore unknown dynamics."}

A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty. Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations. An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes. To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems. LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information. As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \\geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$. Thirdly, we show that LLM compare is robust to hallucinations, with less than $6\\%$ degradation in Pearson correlation for $10\\%$ noise injection. Our work represents a significant step towards replacing time-consuming human annotations and synthetic data generation, and will be an important driver for curriculum design, model evaluation, and AI-assisted research ideation."}

One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement.

Denoting $η\\in(0,1]$ as the fraction of data with correctly matched modalities among $n$ paired samples, we utilize a linear contrastive learning setup to show a provable benefit of data filtering: $(i)$ the error without filtering is upper and lower bounded by $\\frac{1}{η\\sqrt{n}}$, and $(ii)$ the error with teacher-based filtering is upper bounded by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ηn}}$ in the large $η$ regime, and by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ in the small $η$ regime."}

Accurate precipitation forecasts are vital for society. Reliable predictions help communities mitigate climatic impacts. Based on the current relevance of artificial intelligence (AI), classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been used as an alternative or complement to dynamic modeling. However, there is still a lack of broad investigations into the feasibility of purely data-driven approaches for precipitation forecasting. This study aims at addressing this issue where different classical ML and DL approaches for forecasting precipitation in South America, taking into account all 2019 seasons, are considered in a detailed investigation. The selected classical ML techniques were Random Forests and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), while the DL counterparts were a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN 1D), a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. Additionally, the Brazilian Global Atmospheric Model (BAM) was used as a representative of the traditional dynamic modeling approach. We also relied on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to provide some explanations for the models behaviors. LSTM showed strong predictive performance while BAM, the traditional dynamic model representative, had the worst results. Despite presented the higher latency, LSTM was most accurate for heavy precipitation. If cost is a concern, XGBoost offers lower latency with slightly accuracy loss. The results of this research confirm the viability of DL models for climate forecasting, solidifying a global trend in major meteorological and climate forecasting centers."}

Building on a regularization-based framework for structured model learning, we focus on learning parameterized reaction terms and investigate how to incorporate key physical properties, such as mass conservation and quasipositivity, directly into the learning process. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose techniques to systematically modify a given class of parameterized reaction terms such that the resulting terms inherently satisfy mass conservation and quasipositivity, ensuring that the learned RD systems preserve non-negativity and adhere to physical principles. These modifications also guarantee well-posedness of the resulting PDEs under additional regularity and growth conditions. Second, we extend existing theoretical results on regularization-based model learning to RD systems using these physically consistent reaction terms. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the learning problem converge to a unique, regularization-minimizing solution of a limit system even when conservation laws and quasipositivity are enforced. In addition, we provide approximation results for quasipositive functions, essential for constructing physically consistent parameterizations. These results advance the development of interpretable and reliable data-driven models for RD systems that align with fundamental physical laws."}

Typically, BO iteratively updates a probabilistic surrogate model of this mapping and optimizes acquisition functions derived from the model to guide molecule selection. However, its performance is limited in low-data regimes with insufficient prior knowledge and vast candidate spaces. Large language models (LLMs) and chemistry foundation models offer rich priors to enhance BO, but high-dimensional features, costly in-context learning, and the computational burden of deep Bayesian surrogates hinder their full utilization. To address these challenges, we propose a likelihood-free BO method that bypasses explicit surrogate modeling and directly leverages priors from general LLMs and chemistry-specific foundation models to inform acquisition functions. Our method also learns a tree-structured partition of the molecular search space with local acquisition functions, enabling efficient candidate selection via Monte Carlo Tree Search. By further incorporating coarse-grained LLM-based clustering, it substantially improves scalability to large candidate sets by restricting acquisition function evaluations to clusters with statistically higher property values. We show through extensive experiments and ablations that the proposed method substantially improves scalability, robustness, and sample efficiency in LLM-guided BO for molecular discovery."}

Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel \"token rounding\" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE.

However, current deep learning-based RPP methods lack proactive environmental modeling, struggle with realistic multi-transmitter scenarios, and generalize poorly under distribution shifts, particularly when training/testing environments differ in building density or transmitter configurations. This paper identifies three key issues: (1) passive environmental modeling that overlooks transmitters and key environmental features; (2) overemphasis on single-transmitter scenarios despite real-world multi-transmitter prevalence; (3) excessive focus on in-distribution performance while neglecting distribution shift challenges.

This process is further impeded by two key challenges: (1) the difficulty in evaluating encoded quantum states prior to training, and (2) the lack of intuitive methods for analyzing an encoder's ability to effectively distinguish data features.

In contrast to state-of-the-art causal discovery methods that model the problem using discrete-time Dynamic Bayesian networks, our formulation is grounded in Difference-based causal models, which allow milder assumptions for modeling the continuous nature of the system. CaDyT leverages exact Gaussian Process inference for modeling the continuous-time dynamics which is more aligned with the underlying dynamical process.

In this work, we identify key factors that determine the success and failure of training hyperbolic deep RL agents. By analyzing the gradients of core operations in the Poincaré Ball and Hyperboloid models of hyperbolic geometry, we show that large-norm embeddings destabilize gradient-based training, leading to trust-region violations in proximal policy optimization (PPO).

A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty. Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations. An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes. To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems. LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information. As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \\geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$. Thirdly, we show that LLM compare is robust to hallucinations, with less than $6\\%$ degradation in Pearson correlation for $10\\%$ noise injection.

To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_φ$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks.

Experimental results show that GRAFT significantly outperforms strong baselines and reaches or surpasses the state of the art across multiple regions and forecasting horizons. Moreover, the model is robust in event-driven scenarios and enables temporal localization and source-level interpretation of text-to-load effects through attention read-out. We release the benchmark, preprocessing scripts, and forecasting results to facilitate standardized empirical evaluation and reproducibility in power grid load forecasting."}

Existing approaches to learning such dynamics typically either discretize time -- leading to poor performance on irregularly sampled data -- or ignore the underlying causality. We propose CaDyT, a novel method for causal discovery on dynamical systems addressing both these challenges. In contrast to state-of-the-art causal discovery methods that model the problem using discrete-time Dynamic Bayesian networks, our formulation is grounded in Difference-based causal models, which allow milder assumptions for modeling the continuous nature of the system. CaDyT leverages exact Gaussian Process inference for modeling the continuous-time dynamics which is more aligned with the underlying dynamical process. We propose a practical instantiation that identifies the causal structure via a greedy search guided by the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle.

Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_φ$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context.

These constraints present challenges in conducting harmonized multi-center sleep studies and discovering novel, robust biomarkers on shorter timescales. Here, we present AnySleep, a deep neural network model that uses any electroencephalography (EEG) or electrooculography (EOG) data to score sleep at adjustable temporal resolutions.

Recent research has extended the study of stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) from light-tailed to heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in practice, with clipping emerging as a key technique for controlling heavy-tailed gradients. Extensive theoretical advances have further shown that the oracle complexity of SFOMs depends on the tail index $α$ of the noise. Nonetheless, existing complexity results often cover only the case $α\\in (1,2]$, that is, the regime where the noise has a finite mean, while the complexity bounds tend to infinity as $α$ approaches $1$. This paper tackles the general case of noise with tail index $α\\in(0,2]$, covering regimes ranging from noise with bounded variance to noise with an infinite mean, where the latter case has been scarcely studied. Through a novel analysis of the bias-variance trade-off in gradient clipping, we show that when a symmetry measure of the noise tail is controlled, clipped SFOMs achieve improved complexity guarantees in the presence of heavy-tailed noise for any tail index $α\\in (0,2]$. Our analysis of the bias-variance trade-off not only yields new unified complexity guarantees for clipped SFOMs across this full range of tail indices, but is also straightforward to apply and can be combined with classical analyses under light-tailed noise to establish oracle complexity guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Finally, numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings."}

Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality. As a proof of concept, the generated EGMs are used for data augmentation in a downstream noninvasive EGM reconstruction task, where moderate augmentation improves estimation performance. These results demonstrate the potential of VAE-based generative modeling to alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI pipelines."}

We advocate for a shift towards counterfactuals that reflect sustained, goal-directed interventions aligned with clinical reasoning and patient-specific dynamics. We identify critical gaps in existing methods that limit their practical applicability, specifically, temporal blind spots and the lack of user-centered considerations in both method design and evaluation metrics. To support our position, we conduct a robustness analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for time series and show that the generated counterfactuals are highly sensitive to stochastic noise. This finding highlights their limited reliability in real-world clinical settings, where minor measurement variations are inevitable. We conclude by calling for methods and evaluation frameworks that go beyond mere prediction changes without considering feasibility or actionability.

This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter.

Extended version with full proofs, parameter sweeps, and appendices", "summary": "Contemporary reservoir computing relies heavily on smooth, globally Lipschitz continuous activation functions, limiting applications in defense, disaster response, and pharmaceutical modeling where robust operation under extreme conditions is critical. We systematically investigate non-smooth activation functions, including chaotic, stochastic, and fractal variants, in echo state networks. Through comprehensive parameter sweeps across 36,610 reservoir configurations, we demonstrate that several non-smooth functions not only maintain the Echo State Property (ESP) but outperform traditional smooth activations in convergence speed and spectral radius tolerance. Notably, the Cantor function (continuous everywhere and flat almost everywhere) maintains ESP-consistent behavior up to spectral radii of rho ~ 10, an order of magnitude beyond typical bounds for smooth functions, while achieving 2.6x faster convergence than tanh and ReLU. We introduce a theoretical framework for quantized activation functions, defining a Degenerate Echo State Property (d-ESP) that captures stability for discrete-output functions and proving that d-ESP implies traditional ESP. We identify a critical crowding ratio Q=N/k (reservoir size / quantization levels) that predicts failure thresholds for discrete activations. Our analysis reveals that preprocessing topology, rather than continuity per se, determines stability: monotone, compressive preprocessing maintains ESP across scales, while dispersive or discontinuous preprocessing triggers sharp failures. While our findings challenge assumptions about activation function design in reservoir computing, the mechanism underlying the exceptional performance of certain fractal functions remains unexplained, suggesting fundamental gaps in our understanding of how geometric properties of activation functions influence reservoir dynamics."}

Early identification of patients at risk for deterioration is essential not only for patient care quality monitoring but also for physician care management. However, translating varied data streams into accurate and interpretable risk assessments poses significant challenges due to inconsistent data formats. We develop a multimodal machine learning framework, the Early Warning Index (EWI), to predict the aggregate risk of ICU admission, emergency response team dispatch, and mortality. Key to EWI's design is a human-in-the-loop process: clinicians help determine alert thresholds and interpret model outputs, which are enhanced by explainable outputs using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to highlight clinical and operational factors (e.g., scheduled surgeries, ward census) driving each patient's risk. We deploy EWI in a hospital dashboard that stratifies patients into three risk tiers. Using a dataset of 18,633 unique patients at a large U.S. hospital, our approach automatically extracts features from both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data and achieves C-statistics of 0.796. It is currently used as a triage tool for proactively managing at-risk patients. The proposed approach saves physicians valuable time by automatically sorting patients of varying risk levels, allowing them to concentrate on patient care rather than sifting through complex EHR data. By further pinpointing specific risk drivers, the proposed model provides data-informed adjustments to caregiver scheduling and allocation of critical resources. As a result, clinicians and administrators can avert downstream complications, including costly procedures or high readmission rates and improve overall patient flow."}

Recent research has extended the study of stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) from light-tailed to heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in practice, with clipping emerging as a key technique for controlling heavy-tailed gradients. Extensive theoretical advances have further shown that the oracle complexity of SFOMs depends on the tail index $α$ of the noise. Nonetheless, existing complexity results often cover only the case $α\\in (1,2]$, that is, the regime where the noise has a finite mean, while the complexity bounds tend to infinity as $α$ approaches $1$. This paper tackles the general case of noise with tail index $α\\in(0,2]$, covering regimes ranging from noise with bounded variance to noise with an infinite mean, where the latter case has been scarcely studied. Through a novel analysis of the bias-variance trade-off in gradient clipping, we show that when a symmetry measure of the noise tail is controlled, clipped SFOMs achieve improved complexity guarantees in the presence of heavy-tailed noise for any tail index $α\\in (0,2]$. Our analysis of the bias-variance trade-off not only yields new unified complexity guarantees for clipped SFOMs across this full range of tail indices, but is also straightforward to apply and can be combined with classical analyses under light-tailed noise to establish oracle complexity guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Finally, numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings."}

Project page: https://mybearyzhang.github.io/ipr-1", "summary": "Humans learn by observing, interacting with environments, and internalizing physics and causality. Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. To study this, we introduce a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) benchmark of 1,000+ heterogeneous games that exhibit significant visual domain gaps. Existing approaches, including VLMs and world models, struggle to capture underlying physics and causality since they are not focused on core mechanisms and overfit to visual details. VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on levels from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning, and even surpasses GPT-5 overall. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games. These results support physics-centric interaction as a path to steadily improving physical reasoning. Further demos and project details can be found at https://mybearyzhang.github.io/ipr-1."}

The benchmark focuses on coloring odd cycle graphs ($C_3, C_5, C_{11}$) with limited colors, where deterministic, non-communicating agents fail in infinite loops. A strategy passing mechanism is implemented as a form of consistent memory. We show that while standard LLMs and classical heuristics struggle, advanced reasoning models (e.g., O3) devise strategies to escape deadlocks.

The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Additional ablation and scalability studies confirm the method's robustness, achieving up to 40% faster adaptation and consistent fairness, latency, and throughput performance as network scale increases."}

Building on the AAI framework and GVU dynamics from previous works, we define the Mathematics Fiber and show that, when paired with formal proof kernels (e.g. Lean, Coq), GVU flows on this fiber admit spectrally stable self-improvement regimes due to oracle-like verification. Our main technical result is a density theorem: under uniform tightness of agent outputs and a Lipschitz AAI functional, the subspace of batteries generated by mathematical theorem-proving and coding tasks is dense in the moduli space of batteries with respect to the evaluation metric. Coding alone is universal in this sense, while pure mathematics is not; its privilege is spectral rather than expressive. We interpret this as evidence that mathematics and coding provide ``universal coordinates'' for evaluation, and that formal mathematics is a natural ignition domain for recursive self-improvement in advanced AI agents."}

This, in principle, could be a powerful tool in identifying topological order since topology does not always manifest in obvious physical ways (e.g., topological superconductivity) for its decisive confirmation. The problem, however, is that unsupervised learning is a difficult challenge, necessitating huge computing resources, which may not always work. In the current work, we combine unsupervised and supervised learning using an autoencoder to establish that unlabeled data in the Majorana splitting in realistic short disordered nanowires may enable not only a distinction between `topological' and `trivial', but also where their crossover happens in the relevant parameter space. This may be a useful tool in identifying topology in Majorana nanowires."}

Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive."}

Although analytic solutions exist for pulse timings that are optimal under specific noise regimes, identifying the optimal timings for a realistic noise spectrum remains challenging. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for designing pulse sequences on qubits. Our novel action set enables the RL agent to efficiently navigate this inherently non-convex optimization landscape. The action set, derived from Thompson's group $F$, is applicable to a broad class of sequential decision problems whose states can be represented as bounded sequences. We demonstrate that our RL agent can learn pulse sequences that minimize dephasing without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying noise spectrum. This work opens the possibility for real-time learning of optimal dynamical decoupling sequences on qubits which are dephasing-limited. The model-free nature of our algorithm suggests that the agent may ultimately learn optimal pulse sequences even in the presence of unmodeled physical effects, such as pulse errors or non-Gaussian noise."}
