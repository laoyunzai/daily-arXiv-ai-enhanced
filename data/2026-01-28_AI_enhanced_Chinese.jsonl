In traditional settings, disorder strongly impedes transport, resulting in dynamical localization or, at best, sub-ballistic or diffusive dynamics. A distinct and previously unobserved regime, erratic non-Hermitian skin localization (ENHSL), can arise in globally reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices with disorder. It features macroscopic, disorder-dependent localization at irregular bulk positions with subexponential decay, linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. We realize this regime experimentally in an acoustic lattice implementing a disordered Hatano-Nelson chain with imaginary gauge fields. Using Green's-function-based spectroscopy together with time-resolved measurements on the same platform, we reconstruct the full complex spectrum and eigenstates, and directly observe wave-packet dynamics. Remarkably, we observe ballistic transport despite strong spectral localization. We develop a transport theory that connects the dominant propagation site to the maximal random-walk excursion within an expanding light cone and predicts a universal Levy-arcsine statistics, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Our results decouple eigenstate localization from transport and establish ENHSL as a new paradigm for wave dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper discovers a new wave localization regime called erratic non-Hermitian skin localization (ENHSL) where ballistic transport occurs despite strong spectral localization, enabled by disorder in non-Hermitian lattices.", "motivation": "Traditional understanding holds that disorder impedes transport through localization, but this work explores whether distinct localization regimes with unexpected transport properties exist in non-Hermitian systems.", "method": "Experimental realization using an acoustic lattice implementing a disordered Hatano-Nelson chain with imaginary gauge fields, combined with Green's-function spectroscopy and time-resolved measurements to reconstruct complex spectra and observe wave dynamics.", "result": "Observed ENHSL characterized by macroscopic disorder-dependent localization at irregular positions with subexponential decay, yet remarkably exhibiting ballistic transport.

We introduce a canonical framework for diagnosing the formation of Cooper pair condensates based on the Penrose-Onsager criterion, in which superconducting order is encoded in the spectral properties of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM). Within this formulation, the symmetry and structure of the condensate are obtained by projecting the 2RDM onto irreducible representations of the underlying symmetry group, enabling an unbiased identification of both conventional and exotic superconducting states. We demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach through applications to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using both auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For attractive interactions without a magnetic field, we reveal a clear finite-size scaling of the condensate fraction on square lattices of size up to $20\\times 20$. The framework further provides direct access to the internal structure and extent of Cooper pairs, which we track across the BCS-BEC crossover. Moreover, it enables a clean diagnosis of the finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in a magnetic field. Finally, we apply the approach to a supersolid phase in the repulsive Hubbard model with an additional next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^\\prime$, where a charge-density wave coexists with a superconductor. We confirm the fragmented nature of the condensate and uncover substantial pairing correlations in the triplet channel with $p$-wave spatial symmetry in addition to the dominant singlet $d$-wave pairing.

Given the NP complete problem of interest, the configurations space of the problem can be divided in (at least) two regions. In one region, polynomial algorithms to solve the NP complete problem of interest are available (and we discuss one possible realization inspire by the games of chess and go). In the second region the problem to find polynomial time algorithms is very similar to the problem to find polynomial time algorithms to determine the asymptotic behavior of discrete dynamical systems in the chaotic regime. We cannot exclude the existence of a third region which separates the first two: this region would have the characteristics of the edge of chaos. We focuss on the Wang tiling problem of an N X N square (with N large): here a Wang tiles set Gamma is an alphabet. We construct a statistical-physics inspired heuristic which allows to define good alphabets as the ones with a good thermodynamical behavior.

Here, we used a monolayer graphene/h-BN device with an active area of smaller than 20 um x 20 um as a model system and demonstrated that the device could be reliably located in STM solely through topographic imaging of the guiding patterns and in situ stage calibration, without reliance on optical viewports or capacitive sensing.

The coupling strength is controlled by an intercoupling parameter $w$, with $w=0$ corresponding to decoupled quantum Ising systems. We focus on the quantum correlations of one of the two SQI subsystems, $S$, in the ground state of the global system, and study their dependence on both the state of the weakly-coupled complementary part $E$ and the intercoupling strength. We concentrate on regimes in which $S$ develops critical long-range correlations. The most interesting physical scenario arises when both SQI subsystems are critical. In particular, for identical SQI subsystems, the global system is equivalent to the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, characterized by an additional $Z_2$ interchange symmetry between the two subsystem operators. In this limit, one-dimensional SQI systems exhibit a peculiar critical line along which the length-scale critical exponent $\u03bd$ varies continuously with $w$, while two-dimensional systems develop quantum multicritical behaviors characterized by an effective enlargement of the symmetry of the critical modes, from the actual $Z_2\\oplus Z_2$ symmetry to a continuous O(2) symmetry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f0a\u8f9b\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u57fa\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u4e34\u754c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e00\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e34\u754c\u6307\u6570\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5219\u51fa\u73b0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4eceZ\u2082\u2295Z\u2082\u5230O(2)\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u8026\u5408\u4e34\u754c\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5173\u8054\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u65b0\u666e\u9002\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u7531Z\u2082\u5bf9\u79f0\u8026\u5408\u9879\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5806\u53e0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f0a\u8f9b\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u57fa\u6001\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edfS\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u73af\u5883E\u548c\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570w\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5747\u4e34\u754c\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u540c\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50Ashkin-Teller\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4e00\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u03bd\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u7ebf\uff1b\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u51fa\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\uff0c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4eceZ\u2082\u2295Z\u2082\u589e\u5f3a\u81f3O(2)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8026\u5408\u4e34\u754c\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u666e\u9002\u7c7b\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u4e00\u7ef4\u5c55\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5c55\u73b0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes.

The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

An isolated vortex-free plaquette acts as a ``dual vortex'' and binds a fermionic mode at finite energy $\u03b5$ in the bulk gap. This mode is equivalent to two coupled Majorana zero modes located on the same dual vortex. In a continuum approximation, we analytically compute the Majorana wavefunctions and their coupling $\u03b5$ in the two limits of small or large $\u03ba$.

Here we propose an information-backflow phase-diagram approach that places \\emph{quantum entanglement revivals} and \\emph{classical entropy overshoots} on the same footing through a common backflow functional $N_I=\\int_{\\dot I>0}\\dot I\\,dt$. On the quantum side, we employ a fractional (Caputo) extension of a two-state dissipative model embedded by thermo-field dynamics (TFD), yielding a closed-form intrinsic entanglement component $b^{(\u03b1)}_{qe}(t)=\\frac14[E_\u03b1(-\u03bb^\u03b1t^\u03b1)]^2\\sin^2(\u03c9t)$ and an integrated revival measure $N_{qe}$ that delineates a sharp boundary near $\u03b1\\simeq 1/2$ in the $(\u03b1,\u03c9/\u03bb)$ plane. On the classical side, we consider a three-state model whose Markov generator is promoted either to an exponential-kernel generalized master equation (with exact Markov embedding) or to a semi-Markov process with Erlang-2 waiting times. We quantify non-monotonicity by the entropy overshoot $\u0394H$ and KL-based diagnostics on the probability simplex. To strengthen the quantum--classical symmetry, we further introduce a \\emph{fractional Mittag--Leffler memory kernel} in the classical dynamics and show that an analogous backflow transition emerges around $\u03b1\\simeq 1/2$, indicating that the boundary originates from the kernel's mathematical structure rather than from quantumness per se.

Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods.

Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality.

Applying this approach to the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model in 2D and 3D, and contrasting with the 3D Ising (without disorder) and mean-field spin-glass models, we find a stark difference: the locus of susceptibility maxima bends to the right in the field-temperature plane for the Ising and 2D spin-glass cases, indicating a supercritical crossover line, but bends to the left for the mean-field and 3D spin glasses - a signature of the dAT line.

We demonstrate stable convergence across a wide range of interaction strengths for the half-filled Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice, successfully capturing the metal-to-insulator transition.

This overcomes major limitations of two-site DMFT approximations by delivering detailed spectral features while preserving efficiency and compatibility with quantum computing platforms through real-time dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u57df\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u6c42\u89e3DMFT\u81ea\u6d3d\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u671f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5728Bethe\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u4e86Hubbard\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e-\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfDMFT\u5728\u865a\u65f6\u6216\u9891\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\uff1b\u4e24\u70b9DMFT\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b58\u5728\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u9762\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7Trotter\u5316\u6216\u53d8\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6709\u6548\u6742\u8d28\u95ee\u9898\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u542b\u5c11\u91cf\u6d74\u4f4d\u70b9\u7684\u6709\u9650\u4e00\u7ef4\u94fe\uff0c\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u57df\u62df\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u6742\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u76f4\u81f3\u8fbe\u5230\u81ea\u6d3d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u534a\u586b\u5145Hubbard\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u6e05\u6670\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e-\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u8f6c\u53d8\u3001Hubbard\u5e26\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u8d39\u7c73\u80fd\u7ea7\u5904\u8c31\u6743\u91cd\u6291\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u70b9DMFT\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u8be6\u7ec6\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd1\u671f\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684DMFT\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion.

This change of mathematical type constitutes the core of the 'cut': a structurally necessary interface from group-based kinematics to set-based counting. In the presented view the basis relevant for recorded outcomes is not determined by the system Hamiltonian alone; it is induced by the measurement mapping, i.e., by the detector channel together with the coarse-grained readout that defines an instrument. The probabilistic mapping is anchored in symmetry and measure theory: by Gleason-type uniqueness (Gleason for projections in $d>2$ and Busch's extension for Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs) including $d=2$), the trace rule is the unique probability measure consistent with additivity over exclusive events and basis-independence of the unitary sector. A compact qubit--pointer model yields an induced unsharp POVM $E_\\pm=\\tfrac12(\\id\\pm \u03b7\\,\u03c3_z)$ with $\u03b7$ fixed by pointer resolution, displaying explicitly how the detector induces the relevant basis. Finally, nested-observer paradoxes are tightened into a non-composability lemma: joint assignment of outcome propositions is obstructed unless a joint instrument exists.

Here we study diffusion on a rugged energy landscape in the presence of dynamic disorder, a situation relevant to a wide range of disordered systems, including glasses, disordered solids, and biomolecular transport. For static (quenched) Gaussian disorder, Zwanzig derived a compact mean field expression for the diffusion constant, showing that increasing ruggedness leads to a sharp reduction of diffusive transport. Subsequent work demonstrated that in one-dimensional discrete lattices diffusion is further suppressed by rare but long-lived multi-site traps that lie beyond the mean-field description. In many physical systems, however, the local energy landscape is not frozen but fluctuates in time, there by modifying trap lifetimes and transport properties. In this work we develop a minimal, analytically tractable theory of diffusion on rugged energy landscapes with dynamic disorder by allowing site or barrier energies to fluctuate as dichotomic (telegraph) processes with given amplitude and flipping rate. Using a Kehr type formulation appropriate for discrete hopping processes, we derive an analytic expression for the diffusion constant in terms of mean waiting times. We show that dynamic disorder induces a continuous crossover from quasi-quenched, trap-dominated transport to an annealed, motional narrowing regime as the fluctuation rate increases. Explicit numerical calculations confirm this crossover, interpolating between rare-event-dominated diffusion and Zwanzig mean-field regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u5e8f\u5bf9\u5d0e\u5c96\u52bf\u80fd\u9762\u4e0a\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6da8\u843d\u901f\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ece\u9677\u9631\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5230\u8fd0\u52a8\u7a84\u5316\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4ea4\u53c9\u884c\u4e3a", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e3b\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u9759\u6001(\u6dec\u706b)\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf(\u5982\u73bb\u7483\u3001\u65e0\u5e8f\u56fa\u4f53\u548c biomolecular transport)\u5b58\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u5e8f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u6da8\u843d\u666f\u89c2\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6269\u6563\u8f93\u8fd0", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4d\u70b9\u6216\u52bf\u5792\u80fd\u91cf\u89c6\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u7ed9\u5b9a\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u7ffb\u8f6c\u901f\u7387\u7684\u4e24\u6001(\u7535\u62a5)\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684Kehr\u578b\u8868\u8ff0\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f", "result": "\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u5e8f\u4ece\u51c6\u6dec\u706b\u3001\u9677\u9631\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u5230\u9000\u706b\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u7a84\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u4ea4\u53c9\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u4ea4\u53c9\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d2\u503c\u4e8e\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u548cZwanzig\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u5e8f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u5d0e\u5c96\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\u4e0a\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u6210\u529f\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6781\u7aef\u673a\u5236"}}

This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training.

Using the cluster mean-field method, we analyze the phase transitions in the regime $1/2 < J_2/J_1 \\le 1$, where ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases compete. Our results reveal that near the strongly frustrated limit $J_3/J_1 = -1$, the system exhibits order-by-disorder state selection, tricritical and bicritical behavior, critical endpoints, and two successive phase transitions. The ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition remains second order across the entire interaction range, whereas the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic boundary shows a richer behavior, including both first- and second-order transitions as well as tricriticality. Increasing the second-neighbor coupling $J_2/J_1$ narrows the range of $J_3/J_1$ where first-order antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions occur; beyond a certain threshold, only second-order order-disorder transitions persist. Consequently, the tricritical point shifts toward $J_3/J_1 \\approx -1$ as $J_2/J_1$ increases, culminating in a bicritical point where the antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and paramagnetic phases meet.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction. Notably, our method significantly improves accuracy for short-sequence users without sacrificing longsequence effectiveness.

Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions.

While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \\model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text.

MM codes are Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes defined from length-t chain complexes with $t \\ge 4$. The chief advantage of these codes is that they possess metachecks and high confinement that permit complete single-shot decoding, while also having additional algebraic structure that might enable logical non-Clifford gates. We offer a framework that facilitates the construction of long-length chain complexes through the use of Koszul complex. In particular, obtaining explicit boundary maps (parity check and metacheck matrices) is particularly straightforward in our approach. This simple but very general parameterization of codes permitted us to efficiently perform a numerical search, where we identify several MM code candidates that demonstrate these capabilities at high rates and high code distances. Examples of new codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ include $[[96, 12, 8]]$, $[[96, 44, 4]]$ $[[144, 40, 4]]$, $[[216, 12, 12]]$, $[[360, 30, 6]]$, $[[384, 80, 4]]$, $[[486, 24, 12]]$, $[[486, 66, 9]]$ and $[[648, 60, 9]]$.

Collapsing these uncertainties to a single point estimate can distort what is learned. We systematically study how uncertainty propagates through knowledge distillation across three representative model classes--linear regression, feed-forward neural networks, and large language models (LLMs)--and propose simple corrections. We distinguish inter-student uncertainty (variance across independently distilled students) from intra-student uncertainty (variance of a single student's predictive distribution), showing that standard single-response knowledge distillation suppresses intra-student variance while leaving substantial inter-student variability. To address these mismatches, we introduce two variance-aware strategies: averaging multiple teacher responses, which reduces noise at rate $O(1/k)$, and variance-weighting, which combines teacher and student estimates via inverse-variance weighting to yield a minimum-variance estimator. We provide formal guarantees in linear regression, validate the methods in neural networks, and demonstrate empirical gains in LLM distillation, including reduced systematic noise and hallucination.

Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u7684KV\u5e8f\u5217\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faCollectiveKV\u8de8\u7528\u6237KV\u5171\u4eab\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5168\u5c40KV\u6c60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u57285\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c3\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u5c06KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u539f\u5927\u5c0f\u76840.8%\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968f\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002KV\u7f13\u5b58\u867d\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7528\u6237\u57fa\u6570\u5927\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u95f4KV\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6765\u538b\u7f29\u5b58\u50a8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCollectiveKV\u8de8\u7528\u6237KV\u5171\u4eab\u673a\u5236\u3002\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7SVD\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0KV\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u5206\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7279\u6709\u7684\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5168\u5c40KV\u6c60\u6355\u83b7\u8de8\u7528\u6237\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u4ece\u6c60\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5171\u4eabKV\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5b9aKV\u62fc\u63a5\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8KV\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u548c3\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5c06KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u539f\u59cb\u5927\u5c0f\u76840.8%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CollectiveKV\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u7528\u6237KV\u5171\u4eab\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dKV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7edf\u4e00\u66f2\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u91cd\u8fde\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e3aASEHybrid\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5GNN\u4ec5\u5728\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d85\u8d8a\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6GNN\u5728\u4f4e\u540c\u914d\u6027\u56fe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u914d\u6027\u672c\u8eab\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff08\u76f8\u90bb\u8282\u70b9\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u523b\u753b\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4f55\u65f6\u5bf9\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u6709\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u8fde\u63a5\u66f2\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u91cd\u8fde\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528Forman\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684ASEHybrid\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8c03\u6574\u540c\u914d\u6027\u3001\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001Forman\u66f2\u7387\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u91cd\u8fde\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548cLipschitz\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u523b\u753b\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5GNN\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5fc5\u987b\u643a\u5e26\u8d85\u8d8a\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8bc1\u660eForman\u66f2\u7387\u91cd\u5851\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u4f46\u4e0d\u589e\u5f3a\u8d85\u8d8a1-WL\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728Chameleon\u3001Squirrel\u3001Texas\u3001Tolokers\u548cMinesweeper\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u57fa\u7ebf regime \u65e0\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6bd4\u540c\u914d\u6027\u66f4\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u523b\u753b\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002ASEHybrid\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline.

Due to the limitations of the involved elements, however, near-100\\% transmissions were reported under highly demanding experimental conditions for atomic and other media. Based on a structure of three linearly coupled optical resonators, an active one carrying a possibly arbitrary optical gain and two passive ones simply with dissipation, we demonstrate that a transmitted light field can become completely transparent through the structure, which displays all properties similar to those of EIT. Manifested by a destructive interference to annihilate the intracavity field in the resonator directly coupled to the input, this complete transparency exists for any feasible power of the transmitted field and all realizable coupling strengths of the dark resonator with the input and the neighboring resonator, as long as the inter-cavity coupling for two other resonators is adjustable over a suitable range. A free control on the transparency window size and output field intensity can be realized by tuning two inter-cavity couplings without modifying the built-in system parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u8154\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u4e00\u8154\u542b\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4e24\u8154\u6709\u635f\u8017\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7834\u574f\u6027\u5e72\u6d89\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u900f\u660e\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4e14\u900f\u660e\u7a97\u53e3\u53ef\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7535\u78c1\u611f\u5e94\u900f\u660e(EIT)\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1100%\u900f\u5c04\u9700\u8981\u82db\u523b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u5149\u5b66\u8c10\u632f\u8154\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u52a8\u8154\uff08\u53ef\u5e26\u4efb\u610f\u5149\u589e\u76ca\uff09\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u88ab\u52a8\u8154\uff08\u4ec5\u6709\u635f\u8017\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7834\u574f\u6027\u5e72\u6d89\u6d88\u9664\u8f93\u5165\u8154\u7684\u8154\u5185\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u53ea\u9700\u8c03\u8282\u4e24\u4e2a\u88ab\u52a8\u8154\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u900f\u5c04\u573a\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u81ea\u7531\u8c03\u63a7\u900f\u660e\u7a97\u53e3\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u5149\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3cEIT\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u900f\u660e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4ecb\u8d28\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

In the first part we establish -- asymptotically for a large class of (pseudo-)random histories -- that the number of reliable records can be much smaller than the number of possible events, depending on the degree of decoherence. In the second part we reveal a clear decoherence structure for long histories based on a numerically exact solution of a random matrix model that, as we argue, captures generic aspects of decoherence. We observe recoherence between histories with a small Hamming distance, for localized histories admitting a high purity Petz recovery state, and for maverick histories that are statistical outliers with respect to Born's rule. From the perspective of the Many Worlds Interpretation, the first part -- which views the self-location problem as a coherent version of quantum state discrimination -- reveals a \"branch selection problem\", and the second part sheds light on the emergence of Born's rule and the theory confirmation problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b64\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u54ea\u4e9b\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f1a\u7559\u4e0b\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u91cf\u8fdc\u5c11\u4e8e\u53ef\u80fd\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u8be0\u91ca\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b64\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5982\u4f55\u7559\u4e0b\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5bf9\u591a\u4e16\u754c\u8be0\u91ca\u4e2d\u5206\u652f\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u73bb\u6069\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u5386\u53f2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e00\u5927\u7c7b\u968f\u673a\u5386\u53f2\u8fdb\u884c\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u9760\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u8fdc\u5c11\u4e8e\u53ef\u80fd\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5386\u53f2\uff08\u5982\u6c49\u660e\u8ddd\u79bb\u5c0f\u3001\u9ad8\u7eaf\u5ea6Petz\u6062\u590d\u6001\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u79bb\u7fa4\u503c\u5386\u53f2\uff09\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u518d\u76f8\u5e72\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u652f\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u73bb\u6069\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u4e16\u754c\u8be0\u91ca\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Focusing on qubit dynamics on the Bloch sphere, we analyze evolutions generated by stationary and nonstationary Hamiltonians, corresponding to geodesic and nongeodesic trajectories. We formulate Krylov complexity in geometric terms, both instantaneously and in a time-averaged sense, and contrast it with an IG complexity of quantum evolutions characterized in terms of efficiency and curvature. We show that the two measures reflect fundamentally different aspects of quantum dynamics: Krylov's state complexity quantifies the directional spread of the evolving state relative to the initial state, whereas the IG complexity captures the effective volume explored along the trajectory on the Bloch sphere.

The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner.

In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs.

We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers.

In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses.

We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth. Through active probing to detect inconsistencies between retrieved memories and fresh observations, GLOVE enables memory-environment realignment by verifying and updating memory without access to ground-truth supervision or strong reliance on model introspection. We evaluate GLOVE on diverse benchmarks spanning web navigation, planning, and control, augmented with controlled environmental drifts that introduce non-stationarity beyond the original benchmark settings. Our results show that GLOVE substantially improves agent success rates, suggesting a robust pathway to cognitive agents capable of self-evolving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGLOVE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u6d4b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u89c2\u5bdf\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6-\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2dLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7701\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u5f80\u5f80\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGlobal Verifier (GLOVE)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\"\u76f8\u5bf9\u771f\u7406\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u6d4b\u68c0\u6d4b\u68c0\u7d22\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u65b0\u9c9c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7701\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u6f02\u79fb\u540e\uff0cGLOVE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "GLOVE\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u6211\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Readout fidelity is typically limited by a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and energy relaxation ($T_1$ decay), a significant problem for superconducting qubits. While most approaches classify results using clustering algorithms on integrated readout signals, these methods cannot distinguish a qubit that was initially in the ground state from one that decayed to it during measurement. We instead propose using machine learning (ML) on the raw, non-integrated analog signal. We apply time-series classification models, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to the full data trajectory. We find that our LSTM model, combined with filtering and feature engineering, consistently outperforms clustering. The largest improvements come from reclassifying points in the boundary regions between clusters.

While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search.

This architecture incorporates an inverse-squeezing operator following the displacement operation of a conventional Kennedy receiver, mapping the S-BPSK signals onto equivalent large-amplitude coherent states. Furthermore, it employs a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector to perform maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision-making. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under ideal conditions, the IS-Kennedy receiver effectively translates the transmitter's squeezing resources into a displacement gain at the receiver. Consequently, its error probability approaches the Helstrom bound across the entire energy spectrum, remaining within a constant factor of 3 dB. In the low-photon-number regime ($N \\approx 0.6$), the proposed scheme surpasses the coherent-state limit, achieving an error rate below 1\\%. Furthermore, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of system performance under non-ideal conditions, revealing the robustness of PNR detection against background dark counts and a characteristic ``parity photon-number step'' saturation effect arising from squeezing parameter mismatch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9006\u538b\u7f29\u80af\u5c3c\u8fea\u63a5\u6536\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3S-BPSK\u4fe1\u53f7\u5224\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u538b\u7f29\u7b97\u7b26\u548c\u5149\u5b50\u6570\u5206\u8fa8\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1Helstrom\u9650\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u76f8\u79fb\u952e\u63a7\u4f4d\u79fb\u538b\u7f29\u771f\u7a7a\u6001\uff08S-BPSK\uff09\u7684\u5224\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u80af\u5c3c\u8fea\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u4f4d\u79fb\u64cd\u4f5c\u540e\u52a0\u5165\u9006\u538b\u7f29\u7b97\u7b26\uff0c\u5c06S-BPSK\u4fe1\u53f7\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u5927\u632f\u5e45\u76f8\u5e72\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u5b50\u6570\u5206\u8fa8\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u5927\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u5224\u51b3\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u80fd\u5c06\u53d1\u5c04\u7aef\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u8d44\u6e90\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f4d\u79fb\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u80fd\u91cf\u8c31\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u63a5\u8fd1Helstrom\u9650\uff083 dB\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\uff09\u3002\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u5b50\u6570\u533a\u57df\uff08N\u22480.6\uff09\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u76f8\u5e72\u6001\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e1%\u3002\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5149\u5b50\u6570\u5206\u8fa8\u63a2\u6d4b\u5bf9\u80cc\u666f\u6697\u8ba1\u6570\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u53c2\u6570\u5931\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u201c\u5947\u5076\u5149\u5b50\u6570\u9636\u68af\u201d\u9971\u548c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "IS-Kennedy\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u5224\u522bS-BPSK\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme.\n  The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme.\n  Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers. For instance, even for quantum systems that have traditionally been regarded as having no topological band structure, the entanglement of their eigenstates can be related to global geometric universal quantities, reflecting the background geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u5168\u5c40\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5229\u7528Azumaya\u4ee3\u6570\u548cSeveri-Brauer\u6982\u5f62\u63cf\u8ff0\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff08Brauer\u7c7b\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u65e0\u62d3\u6251\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e5f\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u80cc\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6570\u5b66\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u7ea0\u7f20\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u5f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u968f\u7ecf\u5178\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u7ea4\u7ef4\u95f4\u7684\u7c98\u5408\u626d\u66f2\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u626d\u66f2\u4e0e\u7ea0\u7f20\u6709\u6df1\u523b\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u523b\u753b\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Azumaya\u4ee3\u6570\u63cf\u8ff0\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u7eaf\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3aSeveri-Brauer\u6982\u5f62\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u5316\u5230Segre\u7c07\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u7fa4\u6765\u523b\u753b\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5b58\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u963b\u788d\u5f52\u7ed3\u4e3aBrauer\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "1) \u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5728Severi-Brauer\u6982\u5f62\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u7531\u7ea0\u7f20\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6ee4\u8fc7\uff1b2) \u4ee5\u73af\u9762\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u7c98\u5408\u7684holonomy\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u7ea0\u7f20\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\uff1b3) \u53d1\u73b0\u4e0eBerry\u6570\u6216Chern\u6570\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b0\u963b\u788d\u7c7b\uff1b4) \u5373\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u65e0\u62d3\u6251\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u672c\u5f81\u6001\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e5f\u80fd\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u51e0\u4f55\u666e\u9002\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ea0\u7f20\u5177\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u51e0\u4f55\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7Brauer\u7c7b\u7b49\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u523b\u753b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u975e\u62d3\u6251\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u65b0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u542b\u786b\u5e9f\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7105\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u542b\u786b\u5e9f\u6c34\u51c0\u5316\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\u6392\u653e\u3001\u9632\u6b62\u8150\u8680\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u56de\u7528\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u53ca\u4fdd\u62a4\u5de5\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u539f\u6cb9\u52a0\u5de5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9178\u6027\u6210\u5206\uff08\u5982\u786b\u5316\u6c22\u3001\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\uff09\u82e5\u672a\u7ecf\u5904\u7406\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u73af\u5883\u5371\u5bb3\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u8bbe\u5907\u8150\u8680\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528Honeywell UniSim Design R492\u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MATLAB\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u5efa\u7acb\u9600\u95e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528OPC DA\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u6a21\u7cca\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u572821\u79cd\u521d\u59cb\u538b\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u548c5\u79cd\u89e3\u6a21\u7cca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c105\u6b21\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\uff08MSE/RMSE\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u7528Python Streamlit\u5f00\u53d1Web\u4eff\u771f\u754c\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728105\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7a33\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u8c03\u8282\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u8d85\u8c03\u91cf\u7b49\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u7cca\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u9488\u5bf9\u542b\u786b\u5e9f\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u5907\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment.

Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs.

We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters).

During the linear propagation step, we apply the kinetic evolution operator to generate an intermediate quantum state. Subsequently, the Hadamard test is employed to measure the Fourier components of low-wavenumber modes, enabling the efficient reconstruction of nonlinear potentials. The phase transformation corresponding to the reconstructed potential is then implemented via a quantum circuit using the phase kickback technique. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we numerically simulate the evolution of a Gaussian wave packet, a soliton wave, and the wake flow past a cylinder.

Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types.

Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies.

In particular, the $(n, n-1)$-QRACs, which encode $n$ bits of classical information into $n-1$ qubits, provides an ideal theoretical model for verifying quantum advantage in high-dimensional spaces; however, the analytical derivation of optimal codes for general $n$ has remained an open problem. In this paper, we establish an analytical construction method for $(n, n-1)$-QRACs by using an explicit operator formalism. We prove that this construction strictly achieves the numerically conjectured upper bound of the average success probability, $\\mathcal{P} = 1/2 + \\sqrt{(n-1)/n}/2$, for all $n$. Furthermore, we present a systematic algorithm to decompose the derived optimal POVM into standard quantum gates. Since the resulting decoding circuit consists solely of interactions between adjacent qubits, it can be implemented with a circuit depth of $O(n)$ even under linear connectivity constraints. Additionally, we analyze the high-dimensional limit and demonstrate that while the non-commutativity of measurements is suppressed, an information-theoretic gap of $O(\\log n)$ from the Holevo bound inevitably arises for symmetric encoding.

Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures.

A key open question is how long coherence can be extended under this strategy and what fundamental limits constrain it. Here we introduce a fully parameterized, multi-objective periodic-flux modulation framework that simultaneously optimizes energy relaxation $T_1$ and pure dephasing $T_\u03c6$, thereby quantifying the tradeoff between them. For fluxonium qubits with realistic noise spectra, our method enhances $T_\u03c6$ by a factor of 3-5 compared with existing DSS strategies while maintaining $T_1$ in the hundred-microsecond range. We further prove that, although DSSs eliminate first-order sensitivity to low-frequency noise, relaxation rate cannot be reduced arbitrarily close to zero, establishing an upper bound on achievable $T_1$. At the optimized working points, we identify double-DSS regions that are insensitive to both DC and AC flux, providing robust operating bands for experiments. As applications, we design single- and two-qubit control protocols at these operating points and numerically demonstrate high-fidelity gate operations.

Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise.

Higher accuracy requires 36k steps: 1.5 hours for K = 1, 6 hours for K = 4.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u501f\u9274\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\"\u8d62\u5bb6\u901a\u5403\"\u548c\"\u9996\u6b21\u653e\u7535\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\"\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06Tiny Recursive Models\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u4e3a\u4ec5\u91c7\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u505c\u6b62\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u72ec\u6c42\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b097.2%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u4ec5\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a(TTA)\u76841/10\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7ef4\u62a4K\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4f46\u4ec5\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u635f\u5931\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\"\u8d62\u5bb6\"\uff0c\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u5355\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u523096.9%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5ab2\u7f8eTTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7248SwiGLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u4f7fMuon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u5f20RTX 5090\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8fdb\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u662f\"\u5728\u9996\u6b21\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u884c\u52a8\"\u3002\u8d62\u5bb6\u901a\u5403\u7535\u8def\u548c\u9996\u6b21\u653e\u7535\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u9690\u542b\u5730\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u653e\u7535\u65f6\u673a\u89c6\u4e3a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u6b64\u539f\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eTiny Recursive Models\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u5426\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1a(1) \u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728TRM\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u91c7\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u505c\u6b62\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b(2) \u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4K=4\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\"\u8d62\u5bb6\"\u8def\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u901f\u5ea6\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7248SwiGLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u4f7fMuon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728Sudoku-Extreme\u8c1c\u9898\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523097.2%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf(86.1%)\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u4ec5\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a(TTA)\u76841/10\uff08TTA\u8fbe97.3%\uff09\u3002\u5355\u6a21\u578bK=4\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b096.9%\u00b10.6%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5373\u5339\u914dTTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668+K=1\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u57287k\u6b65(40\u5206\u949f)\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u970036k\u6b65(K=1\u97001.5\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0cK=4\u97006\u5c0f\u65f6)\u3002\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u5355\u5f20RTX 5090\u4e0a\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3-only\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u7269\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9700\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u96c6\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Here we experimentally demonstrate a high-accuracy and broadband quantum frequency sensing protocol based on geodesic control, implemented using the electron spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. By engineering an intrinsically single-frequency response, geodesic control enables bias-free frequency estimation with strong suppression of harmonic-induced systematic errors across a wide spectral range spanning from the megahertz to the gigahertz regime. Furthermore, by incorporating synchronized readout, we achieve millihertz-level frequency resolution under noisy signal conditions.

Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. (TPAMI)", "summary": "While many deep learning models trained on private datasets have been deployed in various practical tasks, they may pose a privacy leakage risk as attackers could recover informative data or label knowledge from models. In this work, we present \\emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \\emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks.

By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization.

While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark.

Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes OWLEYE, a zero-shot graph anomaly detection framework that learns transferable normal patterns from multiple graphs via cross-domain feature alignment, multi-pattern dictionary learning, and truncated attention-based reconstruction.", "motivation": "Cross-domain graph data with varying feature semantics and dimensions hinders development of foundational generalist models for graph anomaly detection, making continual learning and inference capabilities challenging open problems.", "method": "OWLEYE uses three components: (1) cross-domain feature alignment to harmonize distributions while preserving domain-specific semantics, (2) multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute patterns, and (3) truncated attention-based reconstruction for in-context learning on unseen graphs.", "result": "Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.", "conclusion": "The framework successfully learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, enabling robust zero-shot anomaly detection on unseen graph-structured data without requiring labeled examples."}}

In this work, we realize a flux-tunable transmon whose nonlinear inductive element is an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction. The tunnel barrier is formed by sequential deposition and full in-situ oxidation of ultrathin Al layers on an exfoliated 4Hb-TaS$_2$ flake, followed by deposition of a top Al electrode, yielding a robust, repeatable hybrid junction process compatible with standard transmon fabrication. Embedding the device in a three-dimensional copper cavity, we observe a SQUID-like flux-dependent spectrum that is quantitatively reproduced by a standard dressed transmon--cavity Hamiltonian, from which we extract parameters in the transmon regime. Across measured devices we obtain sub-microsecond energy relaxation ($T_1$ from $0.08$ to $0.69~\u03bc$s), while Ramsey measurements indicate dephasing faster than our $16$ ns time resolution. We also find a pronounced discrepancy between the Josephson energy inferred from spectroscopy and that expected from the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation using room-temperature junction resistances, pointing to nontrivial junction physics in the hybrid Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ system. Although we do not resolve material-specific subgap modes in the present geometry, this work establishes a practical route to integrating 4Hb-TaS$_2$ into coherent quantum circuits and provides a baseline for future edge-sensitive designs aimed at enhancing coupling to boundary and subgap degrees of freedom in vdW superconductors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f534Hb-TaS\u2082\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\uff0c\u5236\u9020\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eAl/AlO\u2093/4Hb-TaS\u2082\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u68ee\u7ed3\u7684\u78c1\u901a\u53ef\u8c03\u4f20\u8f93\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u8d85\u5bfc\u548c\u5b50\u5e26\u9699\u6fc0\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u68ee\u5143\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edfAl/AlO\u2093/Al\u96a7\u9053\u7ed3\u7684\u7535\u8def\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u548c\u5b50\u5e26\u9699\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u5fae\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u539f\u4f4d\u6c27\u5316\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u6c89\u79ef\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u5265\u79bb\u76844Hb-TaS\u2082\u8584\u7247\u4e0a\u5236\u5907Al/AlO\u2093/4Hb-TaS\u2082\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u68ee\u7ed3\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e09\u7ef4\u94dc\u8154\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u78c1\u901a\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230SQUID\u6837\u78c1\u901a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u5f1b\u8c6b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e9a\u5fae\u79d2\u91cf\u7ea7\uff080.08-0.69 \u03bcs\uff09\uff0c\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\u77ed\u4e8e16 ns\uff0c\u4e14\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u68ee\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0eAmbegaokar-Baratoff\u5173\u7cfb\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5c064Hb-TaS\u2082\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u76f8\u5e72\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u5b50\u5e26\u9699\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u7684\u8fb9\u654f\u611f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.\n  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.\n  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.\n  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU. This result suggests a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring enterprise documents.\n  To support transparency and reproducibility, we open-source the evaluation dataset used in this study.\n  Evaluation Data: https://huggingface.co/datasets/LightningRodLabs/sec_risk_questions_test_set\n  Data Generation Platform: https://lightningrod.ai/\n  SDK: https://github.com/lightning-rod-labs/lightningrod-python-sdk", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06SEC\u5b9a\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u62ab\u9732\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u5c0f\u578b\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ec5\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u5e8f\u6587\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "SEC\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u62ab\u9732\u591a\u4e3a\u5b9a\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6982\u7387\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6982\u7387\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8fde\u63a5\u62ab\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff1a\u4ece\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u7ae0\u8282\u751f\u6210\u4f01\u4e1a\u7279\u5b9a\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u7eed\u62ab\u9732\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u6307\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6982\u7387\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-5\u7b49\u524d\u6cbf\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u524d\u6cbf\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u5728\u5355GPU\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\"\u524d\u77bb\u5b66\u4e60\"\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u5e8f\u9886\u57df\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u4ece\u4f01\u4e1a\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

We show that these edge states enable high-fidelity edge-to-edge excitation transfer using both time-independent protocols, based on coherent edge state dynamics, and time-dependent protocols, based on adiabatic modulation of system parameters.

Here, using only a single coupling axis in the laboratory frame, we introduce a dressed-qubit control protocol that optimally removes the CRT, eliminating the need for the RWA and delivering substantial improvements in multiple performance metrics, including single-qubit gate speed, two-qubit gate fidelity, spectroscopic range, clock stability, and coherence preservation.

Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSOLD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u6b65\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u91c7\u6837\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u5347RNA\u9006\u6298\u53e0\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RNA\u9006\u6298\u53e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e8c\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u8ddd\u79bb\u5dee\u5f02\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u8c03\u63a7\u548c\u5408\u6210\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSOLD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3RNA-FM\u5d4c\u5165\u6355\u83b7\u5171\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u6b65\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5b8c\u6574\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "SOLD\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aRNA\u9006\u6298\u53e0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u6df1\u8fdc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

In the near term, $T$ gates will dominate the cost of fault tolerant implementations, and any reduction in the number of such expensive gates could mean the difference between being able to run a circuit or not. While exact synthesis is exponentially hard in the number of qubits, local synthesis approaches are commonly used to compile large circuits by decomposing them into substructures. However, composing local methods leads to suboptimal compilations in key metrics such as $T$-count or circuit depth, and their performance strongly depends on circuit representation. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing \\textsc{Q-PreSyn}, a strategy that, given a set of local edits preserving circuit equivalence, uses a RL agent to identify effective sequences of such actions and thereby obtain circuit representations that yield a reduced $T$-count upon synthesis. Experimental results of our proposed strategy, applied on top of well-known synthesis algorithms, show up to a $20\\%$ reduction in $T$-count on circuits with up to 25 qubits, without introducing any additional approximation error prior to synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Q-PreSyn uses reinforcement learning to optimize quantum circuit representations before synthesis, reducing expensive T-gates by up to 20% without added error", "motivation": "T-gates dominate fault-tolerant quantum computing costs; current local synthesis methods yield suboptimal T-counts due to circuit representation dependency", "method": "RL agent identifies sequences of equivalence-preserving local edits to preprocess circuits, improving subsequent Clifford+T synthesis outcomes", "result": "Achieves 20% average T-count reduction on 25-qubit circuits when combined with existing synthesis algorithms", "conclusion": "Pre-synthesis representation optimization via RL effectively lowers fault-tolerant resource requirements, enabling more circuits to run within hardware constraints"}}

Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass).

In this approach, quantum error correcting codes are reformulated as low energy spectral projections of Dirac type operators that separate global logical degrees of freedom from local, correctable errors. Locality, code distance, and the Knill Laflamme condition acquire a unified spectral and geometric interpretation in terms of the induced metric and spectrum of the Dirac operator. Within this framework, a wide range of known error correcting codes including classical linear codes, stabilizer codes, GKP type codes, and topological codes are recovered from a single construction. This demonstrates that classical and quantum codes can be organized within a common geometric language. A central advantage of the spectral triple perspective is that the performance of error correction can be directly related to spectral properties. We show that leakage out of the code space is controlled by the spectral gap of the Dirac operator, and that code preserving internal perturbations can systematically increase this gap without altering the encoded logical subspace. This yields a geometric mechanism for enhancing error correction thresholds, which we illustrate explicitly for a stabilizer code.

However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.\n  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline.

We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse.

From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions.

We refer to such measurements as non-positive operator-valued measurements. While existing literature often associates these measurements with initial entanglement between the system and an auxiliary, followed by joint projective measurement and discarding the auxiliary, we demonstrate that initial entanglement between system and auxiliary is not necessary for the emergence of such measurements in the context of state discrimination.

Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift.

Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification.

Here, we explore the theory of weight-constrained stabilizer codes from various foundational perspectives including the complexity of computing code weight and the explicit boundary of feasible low-weight codes in both theoretical and practical settings. We first prove that calculating the optimal code weight is an $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard problem, demonstrating the necessity of establishing bounds for weight that are analytical or efficiently computable. Then we systematically investigate the feasible code parameters with weight constraints. We provide various explicit analytical lower bounds and in particular completely characterize stabilizer codes with weight at most 3, showing that they have distance 2 and code rate at most 1/4. We also develop a powerful linear programming (LP) scheme for setting code parameter bounds with weight constraints, which yields exact optimal weight values for all code parameters with $n\\leq 9$. We further refined this constraint from multiple perspectives by considering the generator weight distribution and overlap. In particular, we consider practical architectures and demonstrate how to apply our methods to e.g.~the IBM 127-qubit chip.

However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic.

In their standard formulation, graph states are generated by controlled-$Z$ interactions and naturally encode symmetric exchange properties. Here we establish a precise correspondence between graph topology and exchange symmetry by proving that a graph state is fully symmetric under particle permutations if and only if the underlying graph is complete. We then introduce a generalized graph-based construction using a non-commutative two-qudit gate, denoted $GR$, which requires directed edges and an explicit vertex ordering. We show that complete directed graphs endowed with appropriate orientations, for an odd number of qudits generate fully antisymmetric multipartite states. Together, these results provide a unified graph-theoretic description of bosonic and fermionic exchange symmetry based on graph completeness and edge orientation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4ea4\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u56fe\u6001\u5728\u7c92\u5b50\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0b\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f53\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f53\u5e95\u5c42\u56fe\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u5bf9\u6613\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50dit\u95e8GR\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5947\u6570\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50dit\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u5168\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u548c\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u8bba\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u56fe\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u4ec5\u80fd\u63cf\u8ff0\u5bf9\u79f0\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u523b\u753b\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7684\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u548c\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bc1\u660e\u56fe\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0e\u56fe\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u975e\u5bf9\u6613\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50dit\u95e8GR\uff1b3. \u91c7\u7528\u6709\u5411\u8fb9\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u9876\u70b9\u6392\u5e8f\u6784\u9020\u5e7f\u4e49\u56fe\u6001\uff1b4. \u5206\u6790\u5177\u6709\u9002\u5f53\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u3002", "result": "1. \u56fe\u6001\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u79f0 \u21d4 \u5e95\u5c42\u56fe\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u56fe\uff1b2. \u5947\u6570\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50dit\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u5168\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6001\uff1b3. \u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u5b9a\u5411\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u4e0e\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u548cGR\u95e8\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56fe\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bf9\u5e94\u65e0\u5411\u5b8c\u5168\u56fe\uff0c\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bf9\u5e94\u6709\u5411\u5b8c\u5168\u56fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Distinct monitoring or intervention schemes can produce different conditioned stochastic quantum trajectories while sharing the same unconditional (ensemble-averaged) dynamics. This is the essence of unravelings of a given Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation: any trajectory-ensemble average of a function that is linear in the conditional state is completely determined by the unconditional density matrix, whereas applying a nonlinear function before averaging can yield unraveling-dependent results beyond the average evolution. A paradigmatic example is resonance fluorescence, where direct photodetection (jump/Poisson) and homodyne or heterodyne detection (diffusive/Wiener) define inequivalent unravelings of the same GKSL dynamics. In earlier work, we showed that nonlinear trajectory averages can distinguish such unravelings, but observing the effect in that optical setting requires demanding experimental precision. Here we translate the same idea to a digital setting by introducing synthetic unravelings implemented as quantum circuits acting on one and two qubits. We design two unravelings - a projective measurement unraveling and a random-unitary \"kick\" unraveling - that share the same ensemble-averaged evolution while yielding different nonlinear conditional-state statistics. We implement the protocols on superconducting-qubit hardware provided by IBM Quantum to access trajectory-level information. We show that the variance across trajectories and the ensemble-averaged von Neumann entropy distinguish the unravelings in both theory and experiment, while the unconditional state and the ensemble-averaged expectation values that are linear in the state remain identical. Our results provide an accessible demonstration that quantum trajectories encode information about measurement backaction beyond what is fixed by the unconditional dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7IBM\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u968f\u673a\u9149\"\u8e22\"\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9unraveling\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8f68\u8ff9\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u51af\u8bfa\u4f9d\u66fc\u71b5\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540cunraveling\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u51fa\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u540c\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u540c\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e73\u5747\u53ef\u533a\u5206unraveling\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u5149\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8981\u6c42\u6781\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u66f4\u4fbf\u6377\u6f14\u793a\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8defunraveling\uff08\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u968f\u673a\u9149\"\u8e22\"\uff09\uff0c\u5728IBM Quantum\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u83b7\u53d6\u8f68\u8ff9\u5c42\u9762\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u7cfb\u7efc\u5e73\u5747\u51af\u8bfa\u4f9d\u66fc\u71b5\u80fd\u533a\u5206unraveling\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6001\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u671f\u671b\u503c\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8d85\u51fa\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8303\u7574\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fbf\u6377\u6f14\u793a\u3002"}}

In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.\n  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\\cdot k \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\\varepsilon\\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity.

Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives.

Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs.

Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains.

MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank \"virtual heads\".

We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances. Second, our lightweight edge-aware module captures pairwise features through residual fusion, enabling effective incorporation of edge-based information and faster convergence.

For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c14\u8c61\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b0\u6d77\u4e0a\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700<5\u4e2a\u6708\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff08MAE 3.52%\uff09\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u5168\u5e74\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b0\u6d77\u4e0a\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u7535\u7f51\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5907\u7528\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u4ea4\u6613\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u8981\u6c42\u5168\u5e74\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u9879\u76ee\u5feb\u901f\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6309\u6c14\u8c61\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u529f\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5929\u6c14\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u6d77\u4e0a\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u52305\u4e2a\u6708\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cMAE\u4e3a3.52%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u5e74\u5ea6\u5468\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6c14\u5019\u611f\u77e5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u9879\u76ee\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u98ce\u8d44\u6e90\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9879\u76ee\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations.

Here we propose GenCP, a novel and elegant generative paradigm for coupled multiphysics simulation. By formulating coupled-physics modeling as a probability modeling problem, our key innovation is to integrate probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, thereby enabling training on data from decoupled simulation and inferring coupled physics during sampling. We also utilize operator-splitting theory in the space of probability evolution to establish error controllability guarantees for this \"conditional-to-joint\" sampling scheme. We evaluate our paradigm on a synthetic setting and three challenging multi-physics scenarios to demonstrate both principled insight and superior application performance of GenCP.

A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities.

We present a measure-theoretic framework that models learning as the evolution of representation measures on a fixed embedding manifold. By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying \"uniformity\" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact.

Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\\%$\\uparrow$.

We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC).

A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery.

Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5916\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u548c\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u6821\u51c6\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u522b\u901a\u7528\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u4e14\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b8c\u5168\u672a\u77e5\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u591a\u5411\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5185\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5916\u5c42\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6b63\u5e38\u4e0e\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u7684softmax\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u95f4\u9694\u4ee5\u6821\u51c6\u51b3\u7b56\u9762\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0b\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u901a\u7528\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u65b0\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN.
